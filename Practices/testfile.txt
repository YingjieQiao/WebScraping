What is it like to remain unmarried for your whole life?
It’s not very nice.At all.Life is a long road when you walk alone on your own.And I know that this will not be one bit to the taste or comfort of many people here, that I will touch a very raw nerve here for many, but that is what I have sincerely seen in life time and again.Not all marriages are happy ones, but the overwhelming majority of unmarried persons with no children in my observation and experience end up lonely and deeply unhappy. Some even start to question what the point of life is in a way that is frankly depressing.This isn’t rocket science. Look, it is all good and fine when you are very young. There is plenty of stuff to do, places to visit, a ton of friends to go out with, all kinds of adventures to be had. And you think “Why settle down when I can continue to have so much fun and adventure?”It grows old after a while.Because most of your friends get married, they have spouses and children to whom most of their time is rightfully devoted.Two things -Humans are hardwired to be social animals.Humans need something to live for, a deep motivation to draw them, a responsibility to carry out.Now you will have the odd case here and there of someone who is so devoted and passionate about their work, that it fulfills all of their emotional needs. But those are few and far between.The other thing is that you had better be one hell of a resilient SOB if you are to return everyday to an empty house. To put it in plain terms for better or worse, I’m a harder man than most others but will admit frankly that no matter how strong you may be, it is simply a cruel feeling to know that you’re essentially on your own to swim or sink against the tide.And no number of friends no matter how close they may be, will be even a fraction as supportive, empathetic and intimate with you so constantly as a loving spouse.And I can tell you personally that it is not a very good feeling when you’ve had a terrible day and have to return to your den to lick your wounds all by yourself. No, you can’t go calling your friends every other day! Not once they have their own families at least.You know, people often think that an obligation like marriage and children will get in the way of their careers when the truth more often than not is the exact opposite.If you are in a high stress career (which is pretty much every prestigious line of work), it’s not very nice to have nothing but your own spine to fall upon time after time. That spine had better be a really thick one.Ask me what it feels like even as a man still only in his 30s to be yelled at by your boss, in a ‘Fuck you, suck it up and deal with it!’ cut-throat field like finance and banking, to have a day at work every now and then that is straight out of hell, then to have to suck it up and swallow that bitter cup in emotional terms all by yourself.There were times when I would return back very late from an awfully bad day at work and call up one of my exes as late as close to midnight and say in a downright pitiful manner “Today was very painful and I really need someone to talk to right now, even if only for a few minutes.” It was borderline pathetic.They were always incredibly patient and compassionate to me. But at some point I simply realized that I couldn’t go doing that every week. Not as a grown man at least.And many successful professionals in the latter stages of their lives have said this to me more times than I could care to count.In perhaps the most prototypical case of that, one of my aunts who was very successful in her career eventually hung up her boots in her 50s because she quite plainly said once to me “Why work anymore? I have no family, no children to provide for. This thing feels meaningless now.”Try then spending the next quarter of a century in retirement with no family of your own, your parents deceased years ago, no children or spouse to miss you or shed tears on your grave when you’re gone.Then all of that freedom, wealth and leisure doesn’t look very enticing anymore, does it?Not only marriage, I would go even one step further in terms of having children.We often speak of our society in the West as being individual-centric. It isn’t. It is actually family and children-centric. Because most people will walk through hell for their children, it’s what gets them to wake up every morning, bend their backs and work. Or you had better really love your job or profession if you plan on doing that as the only motivation for the next 40 years by yourself!The fact that you have those lives who you are devoted to so deeply and who depend on you can be motivating like you will not believe! It is the kind of thing that made my father get up and go to law school as late as his mid 30s, work unbelievably hard twelve hours a day, six days a week, and make a huge success of himself as a powerful attorney who started life out as the son of a small-time peasant.Yes it may appear all impressive but the truth is that for all his talent and will power, I could not imagine him having done that if he did not have the support of my mother and more importantly, the unbelievable level of motivation that came from wanting to provide a life for his children far better than he had ever dreamed of, let alone ever had.Marriage is not some mere mundane institution. I hear people say it all the time. And I think to myself that they say it either out of ignorance when they’re young or to comfort themselves when they’re old.No, that institution - marriage, family, children - is the very cornerstone of human civilization. Without marriage and family, we would have a nihilistic world where individuals would eventually wonder what the point or purpose of life is at all.And you will see plenty proof of that if you have lived for any significant amount of time in large cities like New York. It is especially harsh on women because after a point, it becomes very hard to find a partner since the vast majority of men want to have children and that isn’t possible for the woman not due to some ‘cultural construct’ but from plain biology. Men on the other hand have their own personal hell in that they can’t even complain.Each gender has its own devil.My little sister who is married now and will have her first child this summer, right up to her late 20s said that she never wanted to marry or have kids.And I remember telling her“There is nothing wrong with that life decision but know fully well the pros and cons of it. And like any other important call you make in life, carefully now consider the steep costs that will come with it, not just for today or the next couple of years but for the next twenty or thirty years.”

This answer has to do with a relative. She's pushing 40, beautiful(according to me) and has an insanely successful career. She has never been married and I don't know about her relationships, but from what I can tell she hasn't been in one. She lives with her mother.Here are the things I gathered about her:1) She travels whenever she wants. She doesn't need to coordinate with another person over schedules or locations. She wants to go to Bali, she'll pack her bags and GTFO of India to go to Bali. There's no waiting or planning; there's just doing.2) She is loaded. Seriously, she is. I'd estimate that she earns upwards of Rs. 2 lakhs per month. No husband/partner to buy gifts for and no icky children whose demands need to be fulfilled leaves her with more than enough to do whatever she wants.3) All her time belongs to her and no one else. She is continuously indulging in activities that improve her - reading, writing, travelling, gymming. Whatever she wants to do, she can do(and does) with her free time.4) She gets lonely from time to time. In spite of all the amazing things that she is, she has expressed once or twice that she would have liked to be married. At family functions or with friends who're married/committed, she feels the void.5) She is the cautionary tale for the youngsters in the family. This one really gets my goat but there's no denying it. I cannot tell you how many times relatives would say "When are you getting married? Do it soon...don't tell me you want to be like *her*"! There are a lot of disadvantages and advantages of being single(or being married too). In the end, life is what you make of it.
Like others have noted, without having been married it isn't really possible to compare and contrast it.I'm heading in to my mid-30s and have never been married and haven't been in any serious romantic relationships for at least 5yrs or more. In my mid-20s, following a bad break up I decided to devote myself to going back to school and career change. Now at 34 I've largely accomplished my goals of a decade before, and am realizing that I don't really have much outside of work and my hobbies/interests. While my little brother got married, had a daughter, and is expecting another baby, I'm finding myself alone.I relish the freedom I have to do what I please when I feel like it: even if that freedom is used, more often than not, to simply sleep in and loaf around on my days off. When I decide to go somewhere I simply hit the road with a vague itinerary in mind: no placating somebody else's stomach or bladder or motel room standards. I also have no obligation to sit around and make nice at an in-law's house, or to hang out with a girlfriend's circle of friends, or to sheepishly wait outside a woman's changing room at a department store.However as you get older you realize that that freedom, to go and experience life as you please, comes at the price of never having a committed person in your life to share those experiences with. Which can occasionally make you feel lonely.I'm interested in enough stuff, and adroit enough at entertaining myself, that in my daily existence that sort of existential loneliness doesn't make itself felt. Occasionally however it does.Sometimes you are reminded of your bachelorhood at social functions like a holiday dinner for work where, sans "+1", you inevitably get stuck at the young, single employee table. Once all of your friends marry and have children of their own you find they restructure their social life around befriending a network of other couples who can be trusted to watch their kids, or share in after curricular carpool duties... all stuff a single man can't really relate to or credibly help out with. As an aging, single man all your previously close friendships with single people become increasingly distant acquaintanceships with couples you rarely see or interact with.Also financial independence aside, I think it becomes more difficult to do things like buy a home on a single income. At least where I currently live it seems implausible to buy any real estate on a single income while paying off a mountain of college loan debt. Just about all the folks I know who do own their own homes are married with a working spouse. This is one of the sadder aspects of being single--I do want to own my own little place someday where I can tinker around in the garage in a little workshop of my own. Desiring a sense of permanent 'home' has been a constant longing in my life but as a single man I've felt increasingly doomed to a quasi-nomadic, renter's life. Most of that is psychological I know, but the simple fact remains for me that I know of maybe one or two examples of a single, unmarried person owning their own place.Finally there is the issue of having children. I'm not at all a big believer in the institution of marriage but I do think it can provide a stable environment for the rearing of children. I've gone back and forth as to whether or not I want children.As I've gotten older the idea has become increasingly appealing whereas at 20-25 the idea seemed absurdly expensive. I'm not sure if I'll get to the point where I really want children though: they are still more expensive today that at anytime in the past...and marriage of course isn't a necessary precondition for making them.But I just don't know. Without a wife or a significantly committed woman in my life the idea of having children seems likewise implausible.Getting older without another person to rely on is not so much of a concern in my life but may become increasingly so. The idea of being stuck somewhere after a surgery sucks. I just had my eyes dilated for an eye exam and had to wait a few hours before getting on the freeway to get home. I guess if I was married I could (hopefully) depend on my wife to assist me in times of need--but a long-time girlfriend or friend could be expected to do the same.Marriage as an institution feels very arbitrary and superfluous to me: sort of an archaic cultural construct that evolved in a pre-Industrial historical epoch. Aside from the rearing of children and potential financial leverage of two incomes, it feels more natural to not be married than to be married. In some Native American communities a marriage was simply the recognized living-together-of-a-man-and woman, nothing much more formal than that--and that's how I feel it honestly should be. Instead, our society has accreted an enormous amount of ceremonial, societal, moral, and legal superstructure over the whole simple, natural act of men and women shacking up and making babies together.But it isn't just a Western, Judeo-Christian tradition; marriage is a globally arrived at solution for reproduction and defining family units around the world, although the precise character of marriage changes from place-to-place, people-to-people. People everywhere around the world have been getting married from prehistoric times--it's obviously not just a tired fad the Baby Boomers have handed down.As a single man, with no signs of marriage in sight and no strong desire to be married, I sometimes wonder if I am missing out on some fundamental dimension of the human experience. That is sharing my life in a committed relationship with another human being whose genetic material I'd like to share in creating another generation of descendants, whose maternal qualities I trust to the raising of those children, and whom I can depend on in times of great distress and into the frailty of advanced age and illness and death.By somehow never allowing myself to be molded/restrained by the experience of marriage, I wonder if I have grown into a person unable to compromise, to deeply share, to put somebody's interests above my own. Sometimes I wonder if the lessons of marriage and incidentally those of raising kids, of being committed to them for the rest of your life, to placing their well-being above my boundless personal autonomy, are the final suite of lessons to be learned in the arc of human maturation.If I never get married will I remain emotionally underdeveloped: just an old, cantankerous teenager with money and lots of introspective life experience? Is marriage the final battery of self-disciplining life lessons—in which one performs a familial duty to countless generations of ancestors by selflessly by bringing a new round of human life, a new family, into a cycle of existence? If I never have to compromise with a committed partner, if I never raise children and take responsibility for them, and instead focus on making money to care exclusively for myself—am I shirking the ultimate responsibility as an adult of my species?Today, in the 21st century many people still get married, some at an extremely young age, continuing a timeless tradition. Many practically bankrupt themselves, or more particularly their parents, on a lavish ceremony just to impress upon others that they have made the transition to a married phase of life--which by my own observation is nothing worthy of celebration (staying married is). A large proportion of these marriages succeed in their 'till-death-do-us-part' vows, but many don't.One thing that feels great about not being married is not having to deal with the constantly looming threat of divorce, which by all accounts sounds absolutely miserable and financially ruinous. Being free from marriage means being free from divorce.And stopping short of divorce, I've known some miserable married people who would obviously lead happier lives without marriage. Some are jealous, some are distrusting of their partners--and some have good reason to be. I'll take being ambivalently single to being in a bad marriage any day.
Hmm….There are times I picture my life as a woman who never gets married ever, because:I'm not ready to compromise & just marry anyone.I'm a chronic introvert who would only let certain people into my personal space & life.Is every human a social being?I've read answers which claim that, “In the end, we're all social beings who need company”My tendency of being social in the way many describe is very poor or low.I've suffered through incredible vacations with friends & family which were torturous to me. I kept asking myself, “When will this be over?”I've had expensive vacations paid for me with a shopping budget which I hated.People come back from vacations musing with wonder but I return miserable & wishing I never stepped foot outside my house.This is the 1st year that I figured out that I hate vacationing with other humans & I'm putting a stop to that misery. Last year, I cancelled a vacation to Jamaica & Vegas (many others) with friends. This year, I pretended to be excited to go to Dubai again then canceled at the last minute when my friends pressed me to commit.To be fair, the only vacation I'd approve is only that with 1 of my sisters (mind you, I have 5 sisters but can only stand 1 of them). She's incredible & the only person by far who understands how to keep her nose out of my business.Another trip I wish to plan is with my mom. It's more for her than me because somehow, I want her to leave Nigeria now & then to relax.Is an unmarried life a sad life/failure?Another answer cited 1 particular aunt who was financially successful but unmarried & has become the unfortunate woman every mom warns their daughters about.We focus on this woman's unmarried status & ignore the success she's achieved in other parts of her life. That's the only sad thing in that story.I haven't heard of any unfortunately unmarried man who fathers warn their sons about.The only problem I see in this situation is Society which regards any unmarried persons, especially women as failures.I also wonder why out of all things in life, this is the 1 failure we willingly lift from the world & carry on our shoulders.If we didn't meet “marriage” as a relevant social step, many unmarried people, especially women wouldn't see themselves as failures.In my own case, here's what a colleague told me 1 day,You're 1 woman I know who doesn't need a man to be happy. You're an example of a complete human that I give my friends when they are desperate for relationships or remain stuck in depressing relationships.She also told me,You're too independent. Men want someone they can save.This premise makes it look like I need to be less of myself, when who I am is already complete, with or without a man, friends or family.Why is it necessarily a bad thing or strange even that I don't align with society's morbidly unhealthy fixation with finding soulmates or completeness in other humans?Why is finding a soulmate in myself a bad thing?People look at women like me, feel sorry for us, and assume we're sad & miserable. However, they're the ones who're sad & miserable because they're still desperately searching for the key to their happiness in others when mine is in my own hands.I've found that such people project their own unhappiness on others. Period!Is marriage relationship the only relationship which matters?If I never get married, I know I'd continue to date. I still do.However, I'd continue to have an incredible relationship with my coworkers. Yes! Do you know that we spend 8 hrs+ of our very active lives in our places of work? 1 of my colleague said she sees me more than she sees her own husband.We focus on marriage as the ultimate relationship goals & forget other relationships in our lives. If we never marry, do those relationships just disappear?People wrongly assume that marriage with a husband & kids means we're never lonely & that an unmarried life means we'd be perpetually lonely & miserable. Have you ever seen those who got married to drive away their loneliness? We know how it works out for them. A life of disappointment!!Have you ever being surrounded by a crowd of friends & family but you feel very alone? That's how I feel. The only difference is that I enjoy that loneliness. I enjoy losing myself in a sea of people & disappearing somewhere nice, in my mind.What happens if all our friends are married & we're not?I once visited my girlfriend in Nigeria & she left her kids with the nanny & we had a nice time at some bar with drinks & fish with other friends till the early hours of the morning.I'm an introvert.I don't always need human company but if I do, this relationship doesn't magically disappear just because I'm unmarried.My future unmarried self…..So, friends get married & become busy with life, I'd be equally busy with my career, traveling for fun & building projects to help Nigerian youths battle unemployment, poor quality education & become empowered to do more.Eventually, when my friends’ kids are grown & move out of their homes, they can either join my cause or we can intermittently reconnect over our mutual interests of now being free of kids.Does this question also assume that every marriage lasts forever & our partners would also live forever? That's a great wish to have :).So, if you ask me what an unmarried life is like, I'd tell you that in the absence of a life partner, a positive relationship with myself trumps society's misunderstood opinion about my life :).

I think it very much depends on the culture in the society you plan to live in. That shapes the way people think and feel about others.If the society is liberal, people find their own ways of living. They can decide that they want to stay unmarried, and perhaps have intimate relations. It is totally another thing if one wants to get married to share their thoughts, feeling and everything else with someone and still remain unmarried for various reasons, then I think it will be very painful.I think, it is one of the basic needs of us humans to connect to someone or a community in a deep and meaningful way. In fact sharing a profound though or idea ( at least according to you ) with someone you love or care about is one of the most satisfying things one can do. The person you are married to will definitely be one such person.I have strongly felt that every thought, no matter how small, longs to be either put into some sort of an action or flow and reach a person who is important to you. Being unmarried for life could mean that there are less chances of sharing your most deep feelings, fears, small pleasures etc. which adds to the feeling of isolation and can be painful.At least in India, where I come from, marriage is one of the main ways people are brought together in a strong bonding. And it is the norm that people get married by they are 30 or early 30's. This means that almost everybody you know are married and are busy with their own families. It gets harder and harder to connect with them and with others in general. Also, an unmarried person is easily seen as a miserable one in Indian societies, parents of such grow anxious and are often very sad about it.But, being unmarried also means less responsibility and more freedom to go your own way. Some may choose to be unmarried for this reason. They may reach out to share their thoughts using other means such as art, writing, science, research and many more.
I went out with a friend a few days ago and he looked glum. It took a little prodding to find out what it was all about and it turned out that one of his best friends since high school was diagnosed with a rare and debilitating disease."She's 40," he said, "I am 40, but she has a husband and she has someone who will sit on her bed when she wakes up. I don't have anyone."That got me thinking. It's true that around 30 the world seems to empty out a little. Friends get married, have children, find new circles, stay at home more, and generally "settle down" while the unmarried folk seems to be stuck in the bars and taverns of town, seeking eternally something to replace the family experience with.But that's a simplistic view, isn't it? Sure, when I was 25 I loathed the geezers at the bar who leered at (and often got) the girls. I disliked the flashy, unmarried, midlifer with his Mercedes SLT and the gold watch. But today I realize that that person was lonely to begin with and no marriage would have fixed that.Some of us, and I somehow include myself in that roster, have friends, family, a support network, and a wide variety of tools. We still have responsibilities for others, we still have company, and we still have sex. Some of us even have kids and a mortgage. We're just like the married folk and some of our relationships, friendships, romances, might even last longer than those of the married ones because we have a choice and we can spread our needs and haves.Marriage is just another disclaimer on a piece of paper. It says nothing about the people involved in it, some live open marriages, some live jealous lives. Some cheat, some remain love- and/or sex-less for weeks, months, or the rest of their lives. In short, being unmarried at an old age (and I have friends who are unmarried in their 70s) feels exactly like being married or having been married - the whole gamut from lonely to constantly around amazing people, and from sad to happy.Marriage is pushed onto us as a solution for ills - I don't buy it. My parents were happily married for decades, my uncle has been married six times now. Both have marriages, but in my partners and life I am much closer to my mom and dad than to Uncle Michael.
Having never married, I cannot comment on what it feels like compared to being married, but my guess is that the main difference is the "'til death do you part" level of commitment.So for me, it feels like I haven't yet experienced the concatenation of circumstances that would lead to me honestly answering "yes" the question "do you take this person as your wedded husband... as long as you both shall live?"I've been in relationships longer than some marriages. I've been in relationships that have felt similar to what marriages might feel like. I've been through one breakup that felt a lot like divorce, minus the paperwork. I can no longer have children, so I don't have much internal pressure to start a family. And I am open to the possibility of getting married someday, given the right circumstances.I feel fortunate to live in a time and culture where being an unmarried woman is no big deal. I don't feel like I've missed out on much. I suppose having a wedding could be a fun experience, but if I never get to spend 20K to be the most important person at a big celebration I'm not going to cry any tears over it. (For my money, I'd rather spend it on travel.)So for now, I see the question as similar to "what would it feel like to rent your whole life, and never own a house?" I do own a house, and it feels a lot like renting, except with more commitment.
My aunt, SQ, has remained unmarried all her life.She started off as a school teacher and gradually progressed through ranks to become the school principal.She lives with my older aunt, F, who is a widow with two grown-up children.So a week before my wedding, I asked her about her life and her decision of not getting married at all.This is what Aunt S told me:‘I am very much responsible and accountable for my decision of not getting married. I knew I couldn't commit, so I didn't get into any serious relationship. Besides, I was too attached to your Aunt F to leave her and her children all alone.I'm financially stable and have lived my life on my own terms. I'm have a home and many nephews and nieces to keep me company.My heydays were full of fun and joys. From travelling to hotelling to binge watching TV, I have done it all. I was a fashionista and a trendsetter - the world would shower praises on me. I was a lovely, lively social butterfly, loved and wanted by all.However, as I grew older, I became lonelier. I started getting tired of all the materialiatic and glossy things which attracted me earlier. I longed for children. There were times when I thought of adopting a baby girl, but feared the family resistance and frowns.Then, I fell in love. Once again, my soul re-energised and my spirit bloomed. I yearned for love, children, a home and for a life as a wife and mother.But alas, he passed away.Though I'm happy and healthy in my 60s, the only thing I fear is dying alone. What if nobody finds out that I'm dead? Promise me you'll keep checking on me every now and then?’Of course, I promised her.Nonetheless, the sadness in her voice and the emptiness in her eyes said it all!
I'm 61. I love living alone!I've lived alone now for over 20 years.I had a live-in partner for a few years, a couple of times, so I have a basis for comparison.There's no comparison! :)I'm so glad I had those live-in relationships, or else I would be wondering if I wanted to be married.I definitely do not want to be married!I am a strong INTP, and it's very important for me to be able to follow my thinking where it leads me.Also, getting married is so conditional, despite what people say. They'll swear up and down that they love their partner unconditionally; but, if you tweak just one or two central variables, then that relationship is going to go out the window.Prior to marriage:If that so-called “soulmate” had been 40 years older or 300 pounds heavier, they wouldn’t have given them a second look (unless they, too, were old and heavy).Also, if the “soulmate” had some horribly debilitating disease like ALS, prior to meeting them, again, there's no way they would have partnered up.It's very conditional.Soulmate, my eye.*********I'm so glad I don't have to be trapped in an arrangement that is so conditional, while having to buy into the charade that it's unconditional.I have much more to say on this subject, but my time -- and probably the readers’ patience -- is limited :-)

First of all before taking any decision a wOmen needs to know the actual meaning of marriage..most of d meaning of being a "WOMEN"..!!Marriage is another name of devotion and acceptance..!!It takes lot of courage and guts to holding over on to..it's not as simple as it seems..!!Here vr focusing more over on wOmens because,if we chuck d social and influenced perspective about women's it has been proven that females are far more stronger thn any other gender nd thus considered as extremist !!Research graph has shown tht in imotions,revenge,mental stability,prompt approach,decision making..etc females are more thn 30% active thn any other gender !Hence it is proved that why do I believe that every action,reaction nd relation is based upon women's activity behaviour nd herOwnself..!!After knowing this all facts it's her moral responsibility to take charge of every relation whether it's sister,daughter or even friend  nd utilise her born capabilities..It's her "Dayitva" of taking care of each nd every one she's surrounded off nd understands her responsibilities..!!A women meant and born to b independent..Dont go for d marriage just for d sack of cheap dependency.....!!and if you come over as successful Individual,daughter,sister and friend..only then you should think of getting marry..Because it's d matter of two families and many generations..!!Don't ever ruin this heavenly and holy relation just for few mean motives..!!Go for d one who respects your individuality and your existence..For whom u gonna give ur everything maintain d actual feel of ths relation..!!And if you can't find/maintain....don't go for it....life is yours..live it for full..:) thr are so many things to do:):):):)Think wisely..!!

The biggest most widely sought after advantage is probably the ability to raise children in a family. Having said that, there are thousands of children here in the US waiting to be adopted (and yes singles can adopt, you just have to ask). The dream is having hubby support you and the growing kids while you begin a career, then interrupt to raise family, then when you get good and ready go back to work, and wonder why your salery is not as high as the people around you who didn't get a chance to take time off.No one can decide that one but you. for that matter, you can select a nice guy and ask him to be the biological father. Although he might think you are just after child support. (I am not sure it is legal to write a contract that says that the man who is the bio father is not on the hook for child support. If that is the case no dad is going to want to sire the pups, and then pay child support, without being a functioning father in the family.In most other respects, being single, with or w/o children, wouldn't be much different that a man in the same condition.Are there other issues that you are thinking are potential pros or cons?

Definitely do what you want. Even if it is still viewed as a bad thing, please do what you want. I'm not sure about this either. But, please consider the following. You're saying you'll date and therefore you won't be lonely. Please don't mistake having random company for not being lonely. You might be perfectly happy, but lots of people feel very lonely even wíth a relationship..let alone if you don't have someone 'to come home to'. You might find comfort in friendships, but: they might get partners of their own and even children, and therefore have less time for the friendship. Another thing: if you date, and even if you don't date...you could fall in love, you know. Just as much as people can't 'decide' that they'll be married, because they can't be sure to find someone that will make that happen, you can't be sure someone won't sweep you off your feet and maybe even change your mind about marriage. And also: a relationship isn't the same as marriage...i'm not sure which you mean exactly. Either way, keep all this in mind.

Honestly, being unmarried isn't bad at all. You have total freedom with out worrying about someone else. If you reside here in the USA, marriage isn't what it used too be. It's no longer encouraged to remain married rather the courts are now teaching "how to get a peaceful divorce". However, if you wish to have children. It would be a good idea to have a partner to help your raise them. Just something to think about. And, NO it is not considered to be a negative if a woman chooses not to be married. If you do not have the desire to marry then dont. Why put yourself through the headache if its not what you desire. Forget about what others think. Its your life. No one is living it except you. So do what makes you happy...period!

Life of an unmarried woman?
As a single working mother in the U.S., I've done well -- my son is now an adult. The choice is yours to live as you want to live. I would, however, counsel you to be open just in case you meet someone that fits with you.  I also had several "spinster" aunts who lived fulfilled lives until their 80s. They never married, one stayed home to take care of aging parents and one was a high powered finance executive. They were very close sisters. The role models are out their for whatever lifestyle you choose. The choice is yours.
Fabulous! I do what I want, when I want, which whom I want. I have a great job, a master's degree and do lots of volunteer work. I have a dog that is the woof of my life and my soul mutt. (If I had had her first I wouldn't have had to bother with the marriage and divorce). I play with my 14 nieces and nephews and 16 great nieces and nephews and when they are hungry, angry, tired and messy I give them back to their parents! I take a 2 week trip to Europe annually. I never have to put on pants, shop, cook or clean the house. LOTS more women should consider staying single.
In addition to culture and tradition, marriage is a security licence for women. Under the present living conditions, unmarried women have to face more dificulties than married women. Every country have to develop and provide separate security system for women, till that is achieved, woman living alone is not safe.

Consider this story.Let say a boy of age 25 decided no to marry. He has family (mother, father, sister, brother & relatives). He has got good friends also. He is just 25 and have a job and earning well. He is enjoying every bit of his life. Does he need anyone in his life to make him happy. No, of course not. He goes office, he works and had lot of fun there. He came back home in evening and spend time with family and siblings. Its all fun being in he family.Weekends he hangout with crazy friends. Movies, parties, events, shopping, trip and what not... I told you- “He is enjoying every bit of his life”5 yrs laterHe is 30- most of the friends are either married or committed to any girl or relocated to other city due to Job. Weekend hangout is not as much as it used to be. He got few more friends in office but they are just friends. Sister already got married and living a happy life with husband, he talk with her sister over phone and sometimes visit her house. His brother also got married and got a small cute kid. Father and mother are older now, their health is a concern now.10 yrs laterHe is 35. All of his friends are married. They have got kid and family to look after, so no more weekend fun or trip with friends. They are not as much in contact as they used to be previously. He feel little lonely as friends are busy, people around him in office are either young or married. He can’t stare at girls, as he feel little older. Her sister and brother has got kid and family too to look after. They are little busy in their life. His father is no more. Mother is lying on bed always due to health issue. She needs constant help and care, He sits by her side and try to help her find some happiness.15 yrs laterHe is 40 now. He looks like a middle aged man (a 25 yrs old boy call him uncle). He has no more interest in working as he has nothing to fulfill (He wanted to see the world but going alone make him sad). He is hardly in contact with friends. Sometimes talk to sister. Brother is busy in taking care of his family as he got two kids and wife. Both kids going to school. People in society and relatives do bitching about him being a single. Mother is no more now. She passed away a year before. He miss her mother. He is a lonely guy now. He sleeps alone in loneliness.20 yrs laterHe is 45 now. He has already quit his JOB and gave most of his savings to his brother for his kids. Half of his head hairs are either gone or turned white. He looks little older. There is very less talk between brothers (No personal issue, it is just that they don’t have mush to share). He rarely talk to her sister or meet her. He walk alone on road, sleep alone and eat alone. He is part of his brother’s family but feels alone most of the time.25 yrs laterHe is 50 now. His nephew and niece are young and energetic now. They are busy in their friends, party & college. He remembers his young days seeing them.He reads few books on life and spirituality to pass the time. He uses power glass to read as his eye sight is week now. He rarely meet anyone. He has no hopes or any desire from life. Every day of his life is passing just like another day.30 yrs laterHe is 55 now. He often fell sick. When he fell sick, he want someone to be his side and hold his hand. His nephew and niece are married now. Both living in different city due to job and family. He miss them.40 yrs laterA big photo frame is hanging on the wall. His nephew has came to house for a vacation. His nephew clean the photo frame and decorate it with a fresh flower garland. It was him in the photo frame. Last year he passed away at the age of 64.Though it was a story, Did you like the life of HIM.

Do introvert men live a better life by staying unmarried?
Which is better? Getting married or staying single?
If you ask this question to any married person , his / her reply would be “ don't marry, be happy “ .It's your personal decision, whether you wanna marry or be single for life.Speaking in spiritual terms ,, less attachments - less karma and vice versa.When a man marries , he will have the added responsibility of a husband , and eventually a father , and has to fulfill this duties upto his last breath !!On the contrary , if he is single , then he would not have this duties of husband and father , thus will have less attachments…The more attachments , the more karma ,, and thus you will never have time for introspection of yourself (knowing who you are) and you will be always in this illusionary world (maaya ).Good luck ☺
There is nothing good or bad exist in the world,its all about individual's perception towards that.To marry or to be single is only and only your choice.If you want to marry then you should have your desicion,your own understanding of pros and cons of marriage & it's associated responsibility & restriction.Same thing applied to be single also.Its not easy thing to sustain single if you don't have any plan to tackle loneliness and sickness of partner.You have to be very busy with your choices and likes so you do not feel miss or sick of anybody particularly for physical need as it's most desired & uncontrolled things in life.So give lots of thought then decide best for you.Never decide anything under any influence or under anybody's advise or experience.
Words from JOHN DUMELODon't marry for sex,don't marry because you are of age.don't marry because you are getting old,don't marry because you are lonely,don't marrybecause you need someone to support youfinancially,don't marry because you mistakenly got pregnant.don't marry because you don't want tolose the person,don't marry because of familypressures,don't marry because you like the idea of marriage and admire every wedding gown you see.don't marry because all your friends are gettingmarried.But get married because you are in love, get married cos he or she is your best friend and when that love is no more , he or she can still make you smile.-John DumeloRest everyone is capable of deciding self\U0001f62c\U0001f62cThank you

Sometimes we feel dat it's good to live unmarried becoz it's related to many responsibilities and also becoz we need freedom.But as life is like a bicycle and we have to balance it well, so it's good to get married and take new responsibilities for the future. In everyone’s life dat phase comes where we need a soulmate so it's good to get married with the right person.
No,I think it's not a good idea to stay unmarried for whole life. Eventually time will come when we ll b no longer strong mentally as well as physically. At dat tym,we want someone to hold our hand and stand by our side. No one can do dat better than a life partner.

I am a guy and not a fan of  getting married. It is hard to convince your parents  bcoz they think it is next to impossible to stay unmarried. For you I would say first become financially independent and than move to other city. Else, if you stay with your parents stay unmarried then sooner or later there will be a lot of problems and pressure.

How's your unmarried life been? What is your life advice to people that consider remaining unmarried? Answer only if you have considerable experience of remaining unmarried and/or if you are firm about remaining unmarried for life.
My 35 years of unmarried life has been good with the usual ups and downs.My life choices should work for me. People, ofcourse will have their opinions but this is my life. I am currently in a relationship but I have been single a lot in my life. Being single has been very important for me in developing myself, interests, friendships, career and opinions. I think its necessary to become comfortable with who you are before you can truly be with somebody for marriage or otherwise.I don’t worry if guests/staff in restaurants look at me as the only solo diner (Table for just one???!!!)I don’t worry if I am the only single person in a movie theatre.I don’t worry (but I do get annoyed) when my colleague’s (with a wife and children) long weekend request gets prioritized over mine.The importance of marriage in our society today is dwindling. There is no guarantee for lifelong companionship just because you are married. Fear of being alone is not a good enough reason for me.If you choose to stay unmarried that is a perfectly valid choice just like how getting married is another valid choice.

For a person to mature spiritually and emotionally he/she needs to get married.One thinks one can be free of all problems if one remains unmarried. But that is not the case. A person who is unmarried will get ill will need hospitalisation etc. Hence family is essential.Having a life partner and kids do try your tolerance level. It teaches you to be compassionate, tolerant and selfless. It makes you think of others before you think of yourself.This helps you grow mentally emotionally and spiritually.I thought I did not need to marry as I was happy on my own. I got seriously ill and could not get up to make a cup of tea for myself or leave aside get a glass of water for myself. After a few days I got stuck in a traffic jam and walked a long distance,changed buses and reached home around 10.30 pm. That day I realised that any car could hit me and I could die. The MCD would cremate me as an unknown person as my identity papers would get stolen along with my money. No one was there who would come looking for me.These two incidents changed my mind. I realised that I was being selfish, by not trying to fulfil my purpose in life. This was 1996 March/April. Once you start think in a particular way, the universe moves to fulfil your wish. I met my would be husband in August 1996 and we were married in February 1997.

Why did you choose to remain unmarried?
If we look at behaviors of people all across the world, we will find that ex-communication and solitary confinement are almost a universal way of punishing another person. It is considered one of the most painful punishments ever, without even physically touching the person! Sad and amazing all at once! I think this shows that no matter how much humans like to profess their independence, we are inherently social beings, and actually suffer greatly when deprived of human contact. Even those people I know who live alone and say they never want to get married/remarry etc. always have a pet, or they try to fill their life with a sort of ersatz human interaction in the form of watching a lot of TV, multiplayer games, joining forums, etc. The sad thing I've noticed is that these people start to isolate themselves, so their social skills decline, then when they meet people, they alienate them, and when they feel that,  they become disheartened and isolate themselves more. It can turn into a bad cycle. One does not have to be a blind sheep just to have friends, but I think it is always good to be affiliated with a "tribe" that can look out for you, protect you, and be there to celebrate the joys of your life. If you have this with your group of friends/relatives, I suppose that is fine. However, in the United States, at least, friendship is quite different than in other countries--people rarely hang out with their friends everyday, they can't just walk to the corner to meet their buddies---so I think having a partner takes on even more importance here. Unfortunately, our chances of finding a partner are not equal at all ages--so it is better to start young, when you have a maximum choice of mates, and also, you can build more memories with that one lucky person. :)
I have been alone for most of my adult life. Most of the time that I wasn't alone I was with someone who made me feel like I was alone. Being in a relationship with a person who really cared about me was better than either. And being with a person who made me feel alone was the worst of the three. No relationship stays in the initial adoration phase. But as long as you find one that can continue to be healthy and mutually fulfilling I would say go for it. I've always liked being alone, but as I've gotten older, it's gotten worse. Right now I don't enjoy being alone. I wish I had someone to just spend time with. I want to have someone who is there for me when I need someone to talk to or even to sit quietly with. I want to know that if something were to happen to me, there would be someone that would care for me. I want to know that if I can't do something on my own there is someone who will help me with it. I want to have someone who will tell me that something I am doing doesn't make any sense. I want someone there who enjoys my company and wants me around. I want to have intimate sex with someone who I care about to fill an emotional need, not just sex with someone I hardly know just to fill a physical need.I want to share my life with someone in every way. I want a partner in crime even if that crime is just downloading copyrighted material. I want someone who appreciates the things I do for them as much as I appreciate the things she does for me. I want someone to inspire me to do more for myself I want a reason to wake up in the morning.I want a reason to go to bed at night.I want to be desired and to desire someone else.
Well i can certainly blame the women of today for this since they’re so very picky today when it comes to having a relationship since most of the time the women out there these days want men with a lot of money since they like getting very expensive gifts from these men as well. Many women nowadays are real Golddiggers since it is all about money for them since they will never at all go with many of us good men that don’t make a lot of money but enough to get by which it is good enough for us. Most of the women now are nothing at all like the real good old fashioned women were which most of the women back then were the very best of all and they really did put these women today to real shame as well. The women in those days didn’t really have any money at all since both the men and women at that time were struggling just to make ends meat and they really Accepted one another for who they were which today i will admit that women today have choices. But this is the real reason why many of us good single men are still Not married today since it is the women nowadays that are very high maintenance, independent, selfish, spoiled, greedy, picky, narcissists, and very money hungry that have caused many of us men to be single since we really Can’t blame ourselves at all either. If i had a choice which i definitely would’ve been married with my own good wife and family today which i am very sure that many other men will agree with me as well since it does Take Two To Tango Today.

I have also been single for most of my adult life. Ironically, the only person that has been encouraging me to find someone to date is my ex-boyfriend. I'm not sure why, since he has been adamant about not wanting to be in a long term relationship ever, and has stated that as the main reason why he broke up with me. I have the feeling that you are a very young person. Probably in your early 20s. The best advice I can give you, is to respect your own feelings. If you feel content in your life as it is, then that's a very good sign. It means you're not looking for contentment outside of yourself. You're not relying on anything or anyone to make you happy, and that's a good thing, because happiness comes from within yourself, and not from anyone else.There's an old fashioned idea that dating or marrying someone will somehow complete you as a person.  This myth is perpetuated by older generations as a method to propagate the human race (even though the planet is already overcrowded as it is). If you want proof of people who look for happiness outside of themselves by dating or marrying, and realize their mistake too late, you don't have to go very far.  I'm sure such people exist all around you, and I'm sure they were also pressured into dating/ or marrying and wish they'd had the confidence to find the contentment they wanted within themselves before they involved someone else in their life. It may sound like I'm being negative about relationships, but honestly, I do believe in the value of a positive relationship, as long as you're in the relationship for all the right reasons, none of which include being in that relationship in order to be "happy". Take care of your own happiness and make it a priority, then, if or when you feel it's the right time for you, you may choose to find someone to form an interdependent partnership with. Someone who encourages and inspires you in life and earns your trust and confidence. some of us never find that person and that's OK too. The point is that we don't need to rely on another person to supply our happiness.  A good relationship should add to our life, not complete it.
I certainly don’t and it is scaring me a bit. I donno if my opinion will help you or if I am just annoying people here ( if I a I am sorry) .I am just so happy being alone ( been this way for three years ) and it is scary because I don’t know in what direction society is heading under these circumstances.I live in the UK and around here it seems like all marriages break down, and you need to be really lucky to find someone decent to be with.If you want to be alone forever I say go with it. You can find people to hang out with and to be intimate with without the whole marriage and committed relationship sha-bang. I think it is much more fun to know a lot of people and have all types of different experiences instead of just sticking to that one person, who is likely to leave you anyway. I treat everyone with respect and empathy I don’t treat people unkindly.Stay single! There are plenty of people out there making babies.
I don't know if this is helpful, but I had the same experience with people telling me to go out and start dating. I divorced my ex husband in 1987, and since I had three children to raise on my own, I was too tired to do anything except come home from work, take care of them and fall into bed. That changed when they all grew up and left the house. I was totally unprepared for that. I couldn't believe how quiet my life became. I cried at night after my last child left for about six months, but then something changed within me. I discovered that I liked living alone. I didn't have to negotiate what to eat for dinner, what movies to watch or music to listen to. I could sit in my recliner and fall asleep without being disturbed, go different places without anyone asking "Where did you go?" or "When are you coming home?" And best of all, I have the bathroom all to myself! It was, and still is marvelous. I love my children so much, but I also love having my autonomy and private space. And I'm not lonely. People still bug me about dating, and I was in a relationship for a while. But we broke up. I love my independence more than him, and he sensed that. Sometimes I miss him. But most of the time, I'm grateful that I can live exactly the way I want to live.
One of our life-long friends is now living with a woman. They got together when he was 55 yrs old. She is near his age, they are a great couple and very well matched. This is what he told me. "I wish I hadn't been so afraid to try a relationship. I'm really happy"It doesn't matter if you remain single. It's sad if you refuse to accept love and happiness because of some idea or principle you've held.Many people remain single their complete lives. Very few remain that way, without some other significant relationship in their lives. Maybe it will be with a sibling or parent, or with a community (whether it be religious, or secular), or even just living with a partner.
I am single 40 now, childless, never married, dont even bother to date anybody. i live in asia.

This answer has to do with a relative. She's pushing 40, beautiful(according to me) and has an insanely successful career. She has never been married and I don't know about her relationships, but from what I can tell she hasn't been in one. She lives with her mother.Here are the things I gathered about her:1) She travels whenever she wants. She doesn't need to coordinate with another person over schedules or locations. She wants to go to Bali, she'll pack her bags and GTFO of India to go to Bali. There's no waiting or planning; there's just doing.2) She is loaded. Seriously, she is. I'd estimate that she earns upwards of Rs. 2 lakhs per month. No husband/partner to buy gifts for and no icky children whose demands need to be fulfilled leaves her with more than enough to do whatever she wants.3) All her time belongs to her and no one else. She is continuously indulging in activities that improve her - reading, writing, travelling, gymming. Whatever she wants to do, she can do(and does) with her free time.4) She gets lonely from time to time. In spite of all the amazing things that she is, she has expressed once or twice that she would have liked to be married. At family functions or with friends who're married/committed, she feels the void.5) She is the cautionary tale for the youngsters in the family. This one really gets my goat but there's no denying it. I cannot tell you how many times relatives would say "When are you getting married? Do it soon...don't tell me you want to be like *her*"! There are a lot of disadvantages and advantages of being single(or being married too). In the end, life is what you make of it.

Pros:1. Even though you are single, the safety net of family is always there. Brothers, Sisters, nephews and nieces are there for you in hour of need. 2. You are rich because you need to spend less. No problem of taking care of kids etc. 3. If you have a purpose in life such as excellence in career, politics, social service etc. etc. you can very easily achieve it as Indian single. From what I have noticed, Indian marriages eat lot more into personal time than western societies. Cons:1. You need to invest time into social relationship to ensure people are there for you in hour of need. 2. Getting sex is very difficult unless you have some kind of paid arrangement for it. Or you are rich enough to take frequent trips to Thailand or Singapore. 3. People pity you.
What is it like to remain unmarried for your whole life in India ?
I am 40 and unmarried (I am not making this answer anonymous to give it credibility although I so want to :)). I am not a social creature so you would want to get another side of the story from someone who is social but unmarried. For me, there is only one con and that is at the end of the day you would want to share your life with someone else. Badly. Apart from that, everything else is great. People who say single people are loaded forget the fact that if the their partner is working there are lot of advantages for example, one of my colleague booked a flat for 1.4 crore. Unless I become a director or something that high profile I can't think about that. So that's financial side. One more thing you would want to think about is how much you would want to have kids. Question does not seem important at 25 but becomes very important when you are 30+ if you like kids. In addition to that, you can see the answer from anonymous on (it's the first answer) - How is the life of a male without marriage?  But that is mostly social point of view gladly something I don't care about. I imagine this helps.
I am an unmarried man approaching my 30s, but not exactly a bachelor. That is, I have women in my life that I have romantic and sexual relationships with.In my experience, a lot of married men seem to think of me as a deviant and usurper of sorts - since I get pretty much the 'benefits' of marriage without the fulfulling the 'obligation' (or so they think). A lot of people who will tolerate unmarried celibacy, find unmarried non-platonic life repugnant.Most women seem to think I have some 'issues' with women - they can't understand why I wouldn't want to 'settle down' despite being eligible (in 'worldly' terms) and with no shortage of women that I could have settled down with. I have some nosey aunties tell me that my 'problem' is a fear of commitment and that I should stop 'disrespecting' women by not marrying them. Commitment =/= marriage. Not marrying =/= disrespect. And one doesn't owe a 'duty' to marry.

Relationships create Sentiments and thereby Selfishness! Getting married will thus lead you to Selfishness..Marriage is a common man concept and is considered as Taboo by the most of the civilizations (especially in India) and when you deviate from the societal Taboo, you will be definitely ignored by the society because you are the odd one out!

My 35 years of unmarried life has been good with the usual ups and downs.My life choices should work for me. People, ofcourse will have their opinions but this is my life. I am currently in a relationship but I have been single a lot in my life. Being single has been very important for me in developing myself, interests, friendships, career and opinions. I think its necessary to become comfortable with who you are before you can truly be with somebody for marriage or otherwise.I don’t worry if guests/staff in restaurants look at me as the only solo diner (Table for just one???!!!)I don’t worry if I am the only single person in a movie theatre.I don’t worry (but I do get annoyed) when my colleague’s (with a wife and children) long weekend request gets prioritized over mine.The importance of marriage in our society today is dwindling. There is no guarantee for lifelong companionship just because you are married. Fear of being alone is not a good enough reason for me.If you choose to stay unmarried that is a perfectly valid choice just like how getting married is another valid choice.

For a person to mature spiritually and emotionally he/she needs to get married.One thinks one can be free of all problems if one remains unmarried. But that is not the case. A person who is unmarried will get ill will need hospitalisation etc. Hence family is essential.Having a life partner and kids do try your tolerance level. It teaches you to be compassionate, tolerant and selfless. It makes you think of others before you think of yourself.This helps you grow mentally emotionally and spiritually.I thought I did not need to marry as I was happy on my own. I got seriously ill and could not get up to make a cup of tea for myself or leave aside get a glass of water for myself. After a few days I got stuck in a traffic jam and walked a long distance,changed buses and reached home around 10.30 pm. That day I realised that any car could hit me and I could die. The MCD would cremate me as an unknown person as my identity papers would get stolen along with my money. No one was there who would come looking for me.These two incidents changed my mind. I realised that I was being selfish, by not trying to fulfil my purpose in life. This was 1996 March/April. Once you start think in a particular way, the universe moves to fulfil your wish. I met my would be husband in August 1996 and we were married in February 1997.

Have you ever regretted staying single?
If we look at behaviors of people all across the world, we will find that ex-communication and solitary confinement are almost a universal way of punishing another person. It is considered one of the most painful punishments ever, without even physically touching the person! Sad and amazing all at once! I think this shows that no matter how much humans like to profess their independence, we are inherently social beings, and actually suffer greatly when deprived of human contact. Even those people I know who live alone and say they never want to get married/remarry etc. always have a pet, or they try to fill their life with a sort of ersatz human interaction in the form of watching a lot of TV, multiplayer games, joining forums, etc. The sad thing I've noticed is that these people start to isolate themselves, so their social skills decline, then when they meet people, they alienate them, and when they feel that,  they become disheartened and isolate themselves more. It can turn into a bad cycle. One does not have to be a blind sheep just to have friends, but I think it is always good to be affiliated with a "tribe" that can look out for you, protect you, and be there to celebrate the joys of your life. If you have this with your group of friends/relatives, I suppose that is fine. However, in the United States, at least, friendship is quite different than in other countries--people rarely hang out with their friends everyday, they can't just walk to the corner to meet their buddies---so I think having a partner takes on even more importance here. Unfortunately, our chances of finding a partner are not equal at all ages--so it is better to start young, when you have a maximum choice of mates, and also, you can build more memories with that one lucky person. :)
I have been alone for most of my adult life. Most of the time that I wasn't alone I was with someone who made me feel like I was alone. Being in a relationship with a person who really cared about me was better than either. And being with a person who made me feel alone was the worst of the three. No relationship stays in the initial adoration phase. But as long as you find one that can continue to be healthy and mutually fulfilling I would say go for it. I've always liked being alone, but as I've gotten older, it's gotten worse. Right now I don't enjoy being alone. I wish I had someone to just spend time with. I want to have someone who is there for me when I need someone to talk to or even to sit quietly with. I want to know that if something were to happen to me, there would be someone that would care for me. I want to know that if I can't do something on my own there is someone who will help me with it. I want to have someone who will tell me that something I am doing doesn't make any sense. I want someone there who enjoys my company and wants me around. I want to have intimate sex with someone who I care about to fill an emotional need, not just sex with someone I hardly know just to fill a physical need.I want to share my life with someone in every way. I want a partner in crime even if that crime is just downloading copyrighted material. I want someone who appreciates the things I do for them as much as I appreciate the things she does for me. I want someone to inspire me to do more for myself I want a reason to wake up in the morning.I want a reason to go to bed at night.I want to be desired and to desire someone else.
Well i can certainly blame the women of today for this since they’re so very picky today when it comes to having a relationship since most of the time the women out there these days want men with a lot of money since they like getting very expensive gifts from these men as well. Many women nowadays are real Golddiggers since it is all about money for them since they will never at all go with many of us good men that don’t make a lot of money but enough to get by which it is good enough for us. Most of the women now are nothing at all like the real good old fashioned women were which most of the women back then were the very best of all and they really did put these women today to real shame as well. The women in those days didn’t really have any money at all since both the men and women at that time were struggling just to make ends meat and they really Accepted one another for who they were which today i will admit that women today have choices. But this is the real reason why many of us good single men are still Not married today since it is the women nowadays that are very high maintenance, independent, selfish, spoiled, greedy, picky, narcissists, and very money hungry that have caused many of us men to be single since we really Can’t blame ourselves at all either. If i had a choice which i definitely would’ve been married with my own good wife and family today which i am very sure that many other men will agree with me as well since it does Take Two To Tango Today.

I have also been single for most of my adult life. Ironically, the only person that has been encouraging me to find someone to date is my ex-boyfriend. I'm not sure why, since he has been adamant about not wanting to be in a long term relationship ever, and has stated that as the main reason why he broke up with me. I have the feeling that you are a very young person. Probably in your early 20s. The best advice I can give you, is to respect your own feelings. If you feel content in your life as it is, then that's a very good sign. It means you're not looking for contentment outside of yourself. You're not relying on anything or anyone to make you happy, and that's a good thing, because happiness comes from within yourself, and not from anyone else.There's an old fashioned idea that dating or marrying someone will somehow complete you as a person.  This myth is perpetuated by older generations as a method to propagate the human race (even though the planet is already overcrowded as it is). If you want proof of people who look for happiness outside of themselves by dating or marrying, and realize their mistake too late, you don't have to go very far.  I'm sure such people exist all around you, and I'm sure they were also pressured into dating/ or marrying and wish they'd had the confidence to find the contentment they wanted within themselves before they involved someone else in their life. It may sound like I'm being negative about relationships, but honestly, I do believe in the value of a positive relationship, as long as you're in the relationship for all the right reasons, none of which include being in that relationship in order to be "happy". Take care of your own happiness and make it a priority, then, if or when you feel it's the right time for you, you may choose to find someone to form an interdependent partnership with. Someone who encourages and inspires you in life and earns your trust and confidence. some of us never find that person and that's OK too. The point is that we don't need to rely on another person to supply our happiness.  A good relationship should add to our life, not complete it.
I certainly don’t and it is scaring me a bit. I donno if my opinion will help you or if I am just annoying people here ( if I a I am sorry) .I am just so happy being alone ( been this way for three years ) and it is scary because I don’t know in what direction society is heading under these circumstances.I live in the UK and around here it seems like all marriages break down, and you need to be really lucky to find someone decent to be with.If you want to be alone forever I say go with it. You can find people to hang out with and to be intimate with without the whole marriage and committed relationship sha-bang. I think it is much more fun to know a lot of people and have all types of different experiences instead of just sticking to that one person, who is likely to leave you anyway. I treat everyone with respect and empathy I don’t treat people unkindly.Stay single! There are plenty of people out there making babies.
I don't know if this is helpful, but I had the same experience with people telling me to go out and start dating. I divorced my ex husband in 1987, and since I had three children to raise on my own, I was too tired to do anything except come home from work, take care of them and fall into bed. That changed when they all grew up and left the house. I was totally unprepared for that. I couldn't believe how quiet my life became. I cried at night after my last child left for about six months, but then something changed within me. I discovered that I liked living alone. I didn't have to negotiate what to eat for dinner, what movies to watch or music to listen to. I could sit in my recliner and fall asleep without being disturbed, go different places without anyone asking "Where did you go?" or "When are you coming home?" And best of all, I have the bathroom all to myself! It was, and still is marvelous. I love my children so much, but I also love having my autonomy and private space. And I'm not lonely. People still bug me about dating, and I was in a relationship for a while. But we broke up. I love my independence more than him, and he sensed that. Sometimes I miss him. But most of the time, I'm grateful that I can live exactly the way I want to live.
One of our life-long friends is now living with a woman. They got together when he was 55 yrs old. She is near his age, they are a great couple and very well matched. This is what he told me. "I wish I hadn't been so afraid to try a relationship. I'm really happy"It doesn't matter if you remain single. It's sad if you refuse to accept love and happiness because of some idea or principle you've held.Many people remain single their complete lives. Very few remain that way, without some other significant relationship in their lives. Maybe it will be with a sibling or parent, or with a community (whether it be religious, or secular), or even just living with a partner.

Hi there. I am a 34 year old educated single woman and just recently I am starting to feel the weight and magnitude of having no one. I was never worried because I had a nice career and feel like the right relationship comes when it comes. You can’t force it. I’m also a happy and empathic person and Ive never lacked male attention since I was a teen, but I did start dating late (23) because I was raised very protective.Fast forward 10 years I have three broken relationships and several situationships with guys who wasted my time, lied to, abused, used and betrayed me and I might sound bitter but I heartily wish them the magnitude of all the tears I cried and more deeply. I was innocent and naive and the damage and cost on my person are substantial. I’m still a kind and softhearted person but at this point Im so mad I couldn’t care less and gotten to the point where I resent hearing the words I love you or I care for you because the same arms that held me broke me.Nevertheless I used to pick myself up somehow and am happy with my friends and family and career.The moments I’d feel annoyed were generally the moments in between dating/ relationships that people ( colleagues, landlord) would rudely joke or keep on asking about my relationship status ( seriously, what is wrong with people? ‍♀️) sex life or when I was planning to have babies and act like something was wrong with me. I’ve changed jobs and apartments since then ( life’s too short).Anyway. Now I’m not married and have never felt so unsettled. Why? Because Im so tired of waiting for the right person and want to have a baby so much and am running out of time. Where is he? It’s now dawned on me that women have roughly 15 to 20 years to find the right guy if they want kids and that’s as real as the sun coming up every morning. Its such a harsh and unfortunate reality. It drives me mad and I wake up sobbing in the middle of the night and have frequent nightmares. I’m seriously thinking of lowering my standards ( I don’t like these words because people are who they are and I would never feel myself better than anyone) because I don’t want to be alone anymore. There’s no better feeling than cuddling up to your partner at night and getting a forehead kiss or spooning while watching a movie. I’m currently between jobs and I’ve lost all my motivation. I’m not even applying anymore or thinking about the future ( I’m not yet where I want to be). I feel like I wouldn’t be able to function well at work like this and nobody is ( rightly so) waiting for a depressed colleague anyway.I’ve had options but what to choose between unemployed with zero motivation, uneducated, have no intent of ever wanting to leave their parents home ( mommas boy) and want you to come live in, drug addicts, irresponsible, etc.. Some romantic prospects also didn’t work out because of our careers, life goals etc. Those are people I’m still friends with.Anyway despite everything I’d like to say to everybody there is no perfect way. Marrying early, marrying late, having kids, not having them, it’s all personal. Follow your heart and make the best of what you can. To the shy people I would say you can always turn your life around by following some courses to become more assertive etc.. Also cosmetic surgery is an option. Life is short. Do not deny yourself anything that is within your means to change. I wouldn’t. When I go I’ll go bruised and beaten but in the knowledge that I followed my heart and kicked life back in the butt :) All the best to you all.

I'm 48 and have never married though I have been asked many times (got engaged twice, then called it off because I realised my reasons to accept were suspect).  So far, I haven't met someone I really truly want to spend the rest of my days with. Here are my thoughts and motivations on being unmarried:1. I love my own company. In fact, I need those hours of solitude and without it, I feel out of balance.2. Though I'm single, I have a very active family life with regular interactions with my siblings, their partners, my nephews, nieces, cousins in addition to close friends. And no, I don't have to wait for them to include me in their family activities. Most events that involve my extended family happen at my home. Right now I'm enjoying the quiet and relaxation from after the festive season celebrations that included Christmas luncheon and two barbecues at my house and plenty of visits with family members and friends. I have a large home with plenty of guest rooms for visiting friends, nephews, cousins and siblings and their families. What I'm trying to say is that, being unmarried does not preclude an active family life if that's what suits you. 3. Being unmarried means you don't need to consider anyone else when you want to do something major- like travel. I'm a mobile worker, so I can easily ( and do) travel for work, to get away for some quiet and relaxation or to visit my large family . I've been known to rent a place for a month in cities/towns where my family or friends live and then get on with my life, spending time with them or maybe not socialising at all, whatever suits me.4. Being married and having children is no guarantee that you will not be alone in your old age. Children grow up and move clear across the country for work or because they choose to. They may even move to other countries. Partners divorce or pass away. Lots of old people are alone and lonely even though they married and raised families.5.  Just because I'm unmarried doesn't mean I wouldn't choose to, if the right guy came  along. But as an adult woman who has built a rich life for myself (not necessarily money), I have a great deal to compromise if I marry. That person would have to offer me something extraordinary to tempt me to a commitment. But I'm not unaware that a companion walking with me through this life and showing me new pathways I was unaware of would enrich my life further.6. I have a huge respect for the institution of  marriage. I was born of a couple that was happily married for 0ver 40 years, till death parted them.  My siblings are well-partnered too. So my experience of marriage, albeit a secondary one, has been very good. So I'm not unmarried because I have something against marriage. 7. Old age is what you make of it, and it doesn't have  to be alone and lonely. I live part-time in a village where old people are very active in community affairs and do a myriad of activities to keep busy and active ( play soccer, walk everywhere, meet, help out in wedding preparations... gosh. The elderly are very busy here and integrated into the daily life of the young too). Honestly, old people in this village have a hectic schedule and you'd have more time to yourself if you were young with a fulltime job.

​February 18, 2016 UPDATE: When I posted my answer below, I had no idea of the positive responses that it would get. I didn't seriously think anyone would read it or comment.  I posted it as a lark.What I didn't know then was that I would be treasuring each of those memories and moments so much these past 4 days, because today I was just diagnosed with Stage 3 Lung Cancer.   I have never smoked, I don't drink, do drugs or even caffeine.  I excercise regularly.  My doctors say I am in excellent health, except for the cancer.  I share this to say to all of you, LIVE THE LIVE YOU LOVE with no regrets as I have.  You never know how quickly it might disappear.  I wish you well on your journeys!Love, AnnetteI've been single all my life and I'm now 62 years old.

It’s sad.I came from a dysfunctional family, which had downstream effects on my life. I can look at where I am today and trace how the contours of that life led me to being alone today.When I was 5 years old, I was left alone. I went to kindergarten on the bus alone, and came home on the bus alone. I walked home from the bus stop alone. Because it was midday (I went to a half-day school that ended at noon), I’d get hungry. I used a chair to climb the kitchen counters to get peanut butter and bread. Then I’d lay on the kitchen floor, cuddling the family dog, and wait for an adult to come homeI was sexually assaulted by a family acquaintance from age 6 to 10. When I told my parents about the abuse, and asked for help, they didn’t respond to me or comfort me. They didn’t get me help or intervene. I spent half my living memory (my first memories were at age 2) being sexually exploited and terrorized.My father beat me. He would hit me in the face and call me a bitch and a slut. He went into rages for the smallest of infractions. He took my bedroom door off its hinges. He threatened me. He threw things, called me big-ass, and made sexist comments and jokes. In his shadow, I grew up feeling small and afraid.My mother was emotionally and psychologically abusive. She stood by while my father beat me. Then, while I held my bloody face in my hands, she would tell me what a bad person I was. I was awful. I was unlovable. I was difficult. I was angry (who wouldn’t be). When she wasn’t telling me to my face what a terrible child I was, she was leaving hate notes on my bed or in my backpack. (Kind of like a perverse Hallmark commercial.)She bullied me in private and eroded my sense of self worth. She did this by making me wear shabby clothing, poking fun of my looks and my body, and shaming me. When I was a teenager, she sometimes came into the bathroom when I showered and stood there, silently watching over me. It was scary and bizarre. I sometimes questioned whether she had been there or if I had imagined it.I overheard my mother instigating the violent incidents between me and my father. She’d go to him and lie about how bad I was, or conjure stories about how I was disrespectful.Despite these hardships, I managed to do well at school. I escaped the pain of my circumstances by keeping my head buried in my books.College was hard because my parents exploited me financially. They had diverted my financial aid payments to themselves. I was so brainwashed and shell-shocked that I was afraid to confront them. When I eventually did, largely out of desperation, my needs were dismissed and I was called a liar. Later, in an act of vengeance, they stole my computer out of my dorm room. They did some other fucked up stuff to undermine and control me, but it would take too long to write about that here.I graduated, against all the odds. I moved in with my college boyfriend and we planned our future together. My life felt hopeful and promising. Then, a couple of years after graduation, the unthinkable happened. My parents committed a crime.You might think, “I’d never cover up for my awful family,” or “let them suffer the consequences.” But my parents were extraordinarily bad people, and so, too were their fuckups. It was the kind of crime that, if revealed, would hurt people and ruin all of us. My sibling and I were caught up in shitty circumstances that were not of our own design.We hired a lawyer and were advised that we should pay people off and run out the clock on the statute of limitations.My sibling and I dealt with the legal and financial consequences for almost a decade. I had to leave my boyfriend, as I didn’t want him implicated. It was painful to pack up my stuff and leave behind the love of my life, for reasons I couldn’t ever explain. I cried every night for years, and watched him move on to another woman. A part of me died when he married her. Another part of me felt relieved that he’d found love again.I eventually found myself in another relationship, but because I was hiding so much and dealing with so many toxic behaviors, I didn’t attract a good person. My circumstances meant I was often frustrated, scared, anxious and tired. In time, it was easier for me to believe the worst: that I was fucked up because I came from a fucked up family. I carried around their fucked up secrets and fucked up legacy. No one could kind or healthy could love this fucked up girl.Predictably, my next boyfriend abused me. I knew it was unhealthy and made many attempts to leave. He was volatile, though, and I was now under the thumb of my equally volatile family. One day, I asked my parents to help me leave him, while I sobbed into the phone. My mother said it wasn’t her business and she wouldn’t get involved. She hung up on me. I eventually found the courage and resources to leave him on my own.I was terrified to date again. I spent five years abstaining from sex and relationships, focusing on recovery from the abuse and survival — a task made all the more difficult, given the fact that I was living with a terrible secret that I couldn’t discuss in therapy. But eventually, the statute of limitations had ended.At the end of this, my sibling and I had paid exhorbitant amounts of hush money and legal fees. I realized that I had wasted my youth and some prime earning years. I woke up and I realized that I was sad, scared, broke, old and alone.My friends had married, had children, reached their professional and financial goals, while I had languished in my own private hell. It hurt that my circumstances made it hard to be a “together” person. I knew that my friends privately wondered why someone smart and ambitioud could turn out to be so unhinged.When I recently had a health issue that required support, my parents didn’t feel any obligation to me. They abandoned me and left me on my own. And my sibling lives too far away to be able to help,I was in free fall and it was terrifying. I survived and got through it, but it was not easy. Aside from my material needs, there were moments when I yearned for affection, reassurance, a loving and healing touch. It made me realize that I was truly alone, and, save for my one sibling, always had been.I would like to fall in love at 40 and create a life with someone. To have a chance at a healthy family. To create the loving environment I never had, and to share my love with another person.I’ve done the hard work of unraveling the past and coming to terms with it through intensive trauma therapy. I’ve “re-parented” myself, healed my wounds of neglect (as best as one can, anyway) and tried to create a life of integrity. I’ve focused on my inner and outer beauty, and remained open to people without attaching a lot expectations to outcomes.I was hopeful at first. But modern dating is hard and even harder when you’re 40. So I’m still alone. I’ve come to terms with it and just tried to be happy where I am. Fortunately, I’ve learned how to be alone and to create some joy in my life. I volunteer, give my time to people hurting more than I am, and have made a chosen family out of my dearest and closest friends.There are times that I grieve. Occasionally, I’ll lie in bed and the still of the night feels oppressive and hard to bear. It feels so, so unfair. I sob for what was lost and what will never be.When these days come, I comfort myself by pretending that there’s someone who listens and cares. I talk to myself aloud and recount my story, while imagining a sympathetic other. They’re compassionate and understanding. They acknowledge my loss, they say all the right things.I guess that sounds a little crazy, but loneliness and isolation can be a crazy-making situation.

Marriage is merely a societal construct and there are thousands of people who choose not to tread that path. Does it make you happier? That solely depends on YOU. I know a woman who chose not to marry. Everyday, she wakes up, goes on a run, makes herself breakfast, gets the most difficult things done at work (no matter how long it takes because there are no familial duties to pressure her), and then celebrates by going to a bar with her friends, dancing her heart out and possibly, meeting more fun people. Her weekends comprise of the most exciting adventures people usually have on their bucket lists- skydiving, scuba diving, visiting homeless shelters, tutoring little children, learning to cook, you name it. "What happens when you turn 50?", I once asked her. "I'll do things that give me the same adrenaline rush and not necessarily a heart attack", she replied confidently. The fact that you're alone, does NOT mean that you're lonely; it means you can be strong enough to conquer the day, conquer the world by yourself.I also knew a woman who never married and spent her entire life wanting to find someone. She would always make sad jokes about her lonely life that evoked pity from everyone around her. She got so tired of her boring daily routine that she began to resent herself. She did nothing to change her situation and badmouthed happy couples behind their backs instead. So it could turn out either way. It's up to you to decide what kind of an unmarried person you want to be. Personally, I don't understand why most people constantly feel the need to have a significant other to complete their lives. Maybe we are scared to be alone, or maybe we need someone who believes in us, who loves us, even when we don't. While all of these reasons are valid to some extent, who says marriage is the only solution?! You can have friends, family and most importantly, YOURSELF, to fall back on. You don't need to wait for love and companionship. Make the most your life; you only need yourself to do that! 
What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?
What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?"It's not that I don't like people, I just don't like being around uninteresting, unreliable people or drama queens.A little context here.  I think the spirit of the question regards those who have never married and prefer to be alone by choice.  I was married for 21 years before my wife died of cancer in 2012.  However, I've always been a bit of a loner...since before I was married and have been again since my wife passed three years ago.Short version.  Regarding friends.  I do a lot of things on my own because I have unique interests that others might not share. (visiting Lawrence Livermore labs, JPL, observatories, factory tours and museums).  I often find others unreliable, have annoying habits, don't have enough time or money, or that they may become irritating after a few days together.  If I want to go somewhere I hate waiting on others or have to compromise my plans because they aren't interested in some portion of the adventure.  I'd love to have you along but I'm doing this whether you're coming or not. Regarding companionship.  My wife and I were a perfect match and could be joined at the hip for days on end and never get on each others nerves.  Since her passing I've dated a few women but no one is the complete package as my wife was.  I'm now in my 50's and find that anyone in that age group has a lot of baggage...ex husbands, crappy adult kids, health problems, weight problems, money problems and, or they're reluctant to venture too far from their friends or family.I know I'm being very picky about having to have a perfect relationship but I just don't want to compromise very much.  The way I see it I'd rather be alone and deal with the loneliness than make a commitment and be unhappy with some aspect of it.  Am I selfish?  Maybe, but that's the way I roll.Long storyWhen I was in my 20's and prior to meeting my wife I was serving in the military (Coast Guard).  I took advantage of all the benefits the service offered, especially time off to explore the places where I was stationed.  To my friends and shipmates I often proposed ski trips, surfing, hiking, seeing national parks and whatever was in a few days driving distance.Sometimes they didn't want to go on these little adventures, or they didn't have the money, or wanted to just sit around and drink or play video games.  I was determined to take advantage of seeing and doing everything possible even if it meant going alone. I wasn't going to waste the opportunity because of unmotivated people and I knew I would regret not doing these things later in life, so I set off to do and see stuff by myself if necessary.  As a young single guy in my 20's I went on many of these adventures alone.  Sure, sometimes I'd go with a friend or a group, but it was much easier to make my own plans, go when and where I wanted without having to factor in all the problems of getting someone to go along and all the coordination it involved. Often I would meet new people and join them so making new friends wasn't a problem.So where am I now?  Well, after my wife passed I put our house up for sale, used the money to buy a nice motorhome, thinned out all my belongings to things that were necessary and practical.A little context here.  I think the spirit of the question regards those who have never married and prefer to be alone by choice.  I was married for 21 years before my wife died of cancer in 2012.  However, I've always been a bit of a loner...since before I was married and have been again since my wife passed three years ago.Long story short.  Regarding friends.  I do a lot of things on my own because I have unique interests that others might not share.

What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?
I am seriously warning you against taking any consideration of answers posted by anybody here including me. I am 23 and have never been in a relationship, so I am not at all qualified to answer your question, but seriously! Are others?Most of the people answering the question are with their own narrow cultural perspective. In western countries marriage is trial and failure. It's something they desire (a successful and long lasting one), but not necessarily need. They can go on fall in love at 40's and keep dating in 50's. Whereas in eastern countries it's a compulsion. Most people marry practical strangers with their family's approval. But marriages hardly break and end in divorce. Why am I stressing on this cultural difference? Choice!!! If you have a choice of things and you can choose any one of these lives, it will not impact you harshly. But as soon as you miss the train you will be devastated if you make a wrong decision. So, that much for how long you can remain in this dilemma. I now come to your real question.What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?Incredibly lonely!!! You may think that you will enjoy life, have cool friends ... blah...blah. But just ask me one thing. Suppose this new year you want to spend with your friend and so does her wife who is with him for last 30 years. Who is bound to be left alone on such many occasions?  You won't have that special somebody who will regard you as their world.Moreover, the fun will end one day. Whatever you may like today, you will not love doing the same thing 20 years from hence. Sad part - you want to have anybody with you to share this. Again the people you see who are very happy despite being single are very highly driven ones. They have married their professions. But for every single successful person you can find, you will find 100 committed people who are more successful and have led happier lives.Yeah, granted not all married people have happy lives. But when they grow old at least they will have somebody to share their regrets and mistakes with, if not the happy moments. Believe me, after a certain time you will certainly lose your beauty, then your health and then you will be cold and there will be no charm, friendliness in you. Your parents or siblings might be dead or not with you. But there will be this one person you grew old with. With whom you shared so much that now you care not how they look, feel or say. You love them for what they are. And then one of you may die earlier than the other. The other one will come to farewell on your last journey. Is it not worth it? Is not breaking your heart a couple of times worth it?Your answer:Negative Case:You will be lonely, sad, and regretful of life. If unlucky, also unhealthy. Probably hire somebody to look after yourself. And end up giving everybody to your caretaker because you have no one to pass on your legacy.Positive Case:You will have a very eventful life full of buzz. You will be busy most of your time working and accomplishing a lot. You may not miss anybody. Then you will sometimes come back home. Or too sick or old to work. Then you again will be lonely.
some context on why i am eligible to give answer-this year end I will be 33I am staying alone since 2012, alone means I share flat but I go out alone for movies and dinner.I work from home and sometimes it is like for 2 weeks the only person whom i get to interact is my cook.why I am unmarried when all my friends have kids?My parents are handling matrimonial profile from last 6–7 years.height- 5’6”complexion- wheatish brown, gets tan very easily and add-on is oily sweaty skin ( my parents keep asking me to mention it wheatish in matri profile whereas others see it as dark )salary- more than enoughResponse received on matri- Not a single family meeting could be arranged during these years on matriReason- I don’t know, nobody showed interest, those who accepted interest didn’t communicated to proceed further.Met couple of girls by contacting them myself on a different matri account, they all said no in first meeting and yes they didn’t offer to split the bill.Relationships in life - zeroDates so far - 3 girls from north east, yes only 3 dates in 6 years on tinder/truly-madly/aisle, seems girls from north east don’t care much about complexionAfter analyzing the response on matri and dating apps, i know i am not getting marriedNow people will say sometimes you have to lower your expectations-right, but considering the response received in matri market, I don’t see any value in lowering the expectations to such a level that you end up whining whole life in an uncertain private job to make money for kids born out of an unattractive partner because nobody else said YES. I don’t see any point in that, others may have different opinion.So how it is to stay unmarried and alone? - so far it has not been that bad, recently joined a new company, working on new stuff, doing workout, keeping track of macros and calories, last Sunday watched john wick, this Sunday Chernobyl, started planning early retirement.how would it be to stay unmarried and alone? - not sure about how would it be like after 5, 10 or 20 years, all i know is there are few things you can’t control, it is not necessary that you get to experience everything what others get, also it is not necessary to get into every fight like partner is cheating when you are coding in office.What about emotional health and balance? - better do not depend on someone for emotional balance, learn to be at ease and peace, you can train your mind, train your mind to think what you want it to think.when unmarried, you could do more in life, you could choose to do something for society after taking early retirement, there is lot to do in big country India, you will never get bored alone.Key would be to keep yourself in the best possible state- best state of mind, health and bank balance.
What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?
I'm a 30-year-old woman, never married, childless, and am splitting time between summer holidays at home with my parents in Southeast Asia, and the rest of the year doing my masters in a "Western" country, where I live with flatmates. I'm an involuntarily celibate straight demisexual... which means that I like only men but do not experience sexual attraction unless I've developed emotional attachment first, and that I prefer to be part of a couple but been unable to find a sexual partner/engage in sexual activity for reasons beyond my control. My last long-term relationship ended 3, almost 4 years ago, and I haven't been able to find someone else since.For the most part, my single life since 27 has been awesome. I quit my job and became a travel writer. I'm working out and taking good care of myself. I'm currently on a prestigious scholarship that provides me the opportunity to live in between countries and gaining some enriching experiences and perspectives. I'm studying a subject I deeply care about, and traveled some more as part of researching my thesis. I wrote a book and am in the process of fine editing for publishing next week. I'm collaborating with a visual artist, a filmmaker, and musicians, to tell the story of my book through other media and engage a wider audience with a beautiful message we strongly believe in. Financially I'm doing relatively well, and I believe it will only get better from here. And I'm dreaming bigger dreams for the coming few years: writing more books, get my own column in a prominent newspaper or magazine, found a tech startup and a clothing company, set up a philanthropic initiative, and travel some more to create, inspire, and collaborate.I am proud of who I've become, and I wouldn't give this up for a marriage.That said, ever since I hit my late teens/early twenties, I've had this innate desire for marriage and children, and it has only grown stronger over time. I love being in love with a man I genuinely admire and respect—it is a rare occurrence though—and always hoped that I'll find my "happily ever after". I believe I'd make a great partner and wife, and people who know my track record in relationships would confirm that I'm one who makes deliberate effort to appreciate my partner, communicates concerns in a diplomatic and considerate way, actively listens and gives my undivided presence, defines my principles and stands up for them, fights fair in conflicts, forgives each other, dreams future goals together and committing to them, be by my partner's side when the going gets tough, takes good care of the home and is well versed in doing the "business" side of the relationship (finances, property, responsibilities). So in my view, I deserve to be married because I can bring a lot to the table and make someone's life happier and more beautiful. But that also means that I deserve someone who can and will commit to doing as much for me as I do for him, and accepts the life I've been living before he came into the picture. I won't marry a man who says, "Party's over, no more long solo travels and writing career for you. Now make me dinner and give me a blow job because as your husband now I call the shots over your life." Though my life will undoubtedly change after marriage and kids, the man I marry has to appreciate the life and person I've developed into over all these years, encourage me to continue being who I am, and would dream new dreams with me (that includes him and kids in the picture) that respects the continuation of that life path I've built way before he came into the picture.Despite my desire for marriage, since I was a little girl I've developed a strong aversion to patriarchy (the system in which men hold the dominant power, unfairly subjecting women to serve men's interests at the expense of their own). Being brought up in a conservative Christian household, I've been taught that in order for a marriage  and motherhood to work, women need to tolerate a little bit of patriarchy because that's "God's way." I later became an agnostic after my parents separated due to my father's affair with another woman, and got back together because apparently my mother can't live without him (and wanted to "obey God's will," avoiding ostracising from the church community that's become the centre of her universe.)In addition to these, I had a sex-negative upbringing (meaning that as an adolescent I was discouraged from expressing attraction to boys and developing relationships with them). When I finally had my first relationship at ages 18-19, I got myself an abusive boyfriend while living away from my family and friends on the other side of the world. My life got better at 21-22... in hindsight I probably should have spent those early prime years prioritising finding a partner... but I was broke, fighting personal demons and trying to start my life over, so I figured that it was only responsible to make myself better first before opening up to a relationship.When I was 24, I started a 3-year relationship with a guy who had been a good friend since I was 18, and was there for me when I was breaking up with my abuser. I thought he was the love of my life and was preparing to marry him. Unfortunately he wasn't willing to deal with my past or plan a future, just wanted to clip my wings when I try to dream, and always had to prove that he's smart and I'm dumb... which in hindsight, I guess, is a form of abuse as well. But of course nobody else sees it because he's otherwise a gentle, polite and nice guy with a great, respectable career--other people generally think he's a good man and my father had high hopes on him. Anyway, the life I'm living now is one that I've been dreaming about ever since I was with him... and I dreamed it in such a way hoping that the things I do would teach me how to be a great wife for him (read paragraph 4). I chose a writing career because it gives me the flexibility to work from home and immerse my children in my world as I teach them life lessons, values, and how to dream their future. I have no fear that being married or having children would take away the awesome life I'm living now--though it will mean that I'll have to start planning my life around them and be creative in providing for them experiences that make them fall in love with life itself. If anything, I want the opportunity to let marriage and children transform the life I have right now into something more enriching--even if it means constantly keeping my ego in check, putting up with pet peeves, making financial sacrifices, and dealing with dirty diapers. But my pre-condition for saying "yes" to marriage is that my spouse would have to be willing to accommodate the things I believe matter most to life--both by being part of it, and by giving me the freedom to feed my soul as an individual (so that I have life and spark to colour his world and that of our children).I've since yet to find a man who's willing to share that kind of life with me. When I was 22, good prospectable single men were all over me, but at 27-28 they're all suddenly gone. The next boyfriend I had was a 3-month fling from work, with whom I shared great chemistry, who expressed the closest thing I've ever had to a partner supportively believing in my dreams, encouraged me to be a better person, and led me on to believe that he was in love with me. So I developed real feelings for him, which I expressed liberally when I thought it was mutual... only to find out later that he didn't mean it. This fling, so far, is the only man I've ever slept with (the other guy I almost married was a practicing Christian who intended to have us "save ourselves"... so when we broke up after 3 years without ever kissing or having sex, I surprisedly felt defeminised and extremely hurt). When my fling left, what hurts most was the impression that he gave up on me because I'm not worth fighting for. It made me feel that there's something inherently defective with me. If there's nothing wrong with me, then how come men don't love me and won't commit to me? I feel like I'm that gorgeous mansion on a secluded cliff outlooking the sea--the kind everyone says they want but nobody actually buys because it's too expensive, requires high maintenance, and takes effort getting to and from. Everytime a prospective buyer decides against buying the mansion, I renovate and make it an even nicer place to call home. But instead of attracting new buyers I scare my prospects even more because I just added extra zeros behind the price and won't settle for less. At best, I get renters who would hire the proverbial mansion to host parties over the weekend but won't lift a finger to clean up their mess. Like, why is it so hard to just find someone who thinks I'm worth it? Or should I just watch this mansion eventually crumble in its old age and go to waste without ever having to house a good family that would take great care of it?I tried dating but after seeing many guys whose names I have trouble remembering, I find it pointless and too hard to keep up with. Dates are when strangers put their best foot forward to try to get into someone else's pants. What I want is someone who I can get to know in the real world and grow real feelings for before I decide to share my body with them. Western culture's "three date rule" absolutely disgusts me--I would much rather have an arranged marriage with someone my parents vouch is good for me, than have sex with a strange man I've only had three dinners with. So most of the time I just stop calling after the first or second date.The men I've developed serious relationships with had never been men I met through "dates", and always been someone I knew in the context of a community--college, church, or work. Unless I have the opportunity to observe the man candidly in this context, I can't know him well enough to decide whether he's worth committing to. And since I've both developed a super-independent personality and a history of traumatic relationship, I've tended to develop what I'd call "damsel in distress syndrome" as a precondition for falling in love. I only fall in love with some men who stand by me in a crisis, because this suggests to me that I'll be able to rely on him to stay with me and face rough patches together in the future ... and I've find it hard to change this precondition even after having been proven wrong. And that sucks because I can't wish for or deliberately create a crisis, because that's against my principles and doing so would make me a desperate idiot undeserving of the man that falls for it... nor should a man put me in a crisis for the sake of saving me as my "knight in shining armour" because that would make him a deceitful asshole undeserving of me.Because of this, I've decided to give up on dating. As I've said in the beginning, the life I live right now is awesome enough, and I don't want my childlessness and lovelessness to sabotage my happiness. That said, the heart wants what it wants, and I have a marriage-shaped hole in my heart that nothing else can fill. The best I can do is to make peace with that void and live with it. It doesn't mean I don't cry myself to sleep some nights, or stare at my naked body in the mirror with regret, thinking what if I grow old without ever making love again, or having the chance to bear children. And admittedly on some days I wonder whether there is a point of continuing what I do if I don't get to have a loving husband to grow old with and children to pass on my legacy. I remember traveling to one of the most beautiful places in the world last year and staring out the bus window just sobbing, thinking what if this awesome single life I'm living means doing without something else I also want so much?That said, I still have a few more prime years to go, and till those years are gone, I'll keep a small flicker of hope in my heart... not so big that I'm set for disappointment, but just enough to grasp the opportunity should a miracle happen. I'll keep preparing mentally and financially for the prospect of a future marriage and kids, but not actively look for it. I'd rather focus my energy on the life I do have, maximising and being grateful for it.If I don't get partnered by 36, then I'd consider Single Motherhood by Choice (SMC) as a compromise. But I can't tell my friends and family because many would think I'm dishonouring myself. Sperm donors and adoption isn't legally available for unmarried persons in my country, so probably I'll have to get knocked up over a fling, or wreck a friendship or a job or someone else's marriage... and I'm done crying with disappointment over myself for the thought of doing these things... but I have my heart set that whatever I have to do to make my child(ren) happen will be worth it. In a semi-ideal world, the father would be a good man who then decides he loves me and wants to raise this child with me as my husband until we both grow old. But even if he  pisses off and I never see him again, I'd at least have a child who I'd hopefully be able to single-handedly love unconditionally, provide for, and raise into a good person who loves life. And I'm sure that somehow I'll have a community that loves this child almost as much as I do, who will have my back in my efforts to provide a safe, loving, responsible and honourable environment for this child to grow up in.And if that fails as well by the time I'm 40, then I'll get my PhD in Peace Studies or something related that I care about with my life, and get myself posted in a particular war zone where my set of political beliefs is likely to get me killed. (No, that doesn't count as suicide.) Best case scenario, I'd somehow make it there safely, volunteer locally in a youth programme, mentor some kids/adolescents who come to look up to me as a mother figure, and will keep coming back to me when they're grown and I'm old. Worst case scenario, I die young fighting for something honourable, people who respect my work mourn my death and honour my memory even if from a distance, and nobody has to worry about me growing old alone.So yeah... that's my personal experience of being unmarried and living alone. Thank you for asking this question and providing me with the opportunity to talk about something I can't talk about most of the time.

First of all before taking any decision a wOmen needs to know the actual meaning of marriage..most of d meaning of being a "WOMEN"..!!Marriage is another name of devotion and acceptance..!!It takes lot of courage and guts to holding over on to..it's not as simple as it seems..!!Here vr focusing more over on wOmens because,if we chuck d social and influenced perspective about women's it has been proven that females are far more stronger thn any other gender nd thus considered as extremist !!Research graph has shown tht in imotions,revenge,mental stability,prompt approach,decision making..etc females are more thn 30% active thn any other gender !Hence it is proved that why do I believe that every action,reaction nd relation is based upon women's activity behaviour nd herOwnself..!!After knowing this all facts it's her moral responsibility to take charge of every relation whether it's sister,daughter or even friend  nd utilise her born capabilities..It's her "Dayitva" of taking care of each nd every one she's surrounded off nd understands her responsibilities..!!A women meant and born to b independent..Dont go for d marriage just for d sack of cheap dependency.....!!and if you come over as successful Individual,daughter,sister and friend..only then you should think of getting marry..Because it's d matter of two families and many generations..!!Don't ever ruin this heavenly and holy relation just for few mean motives..!!Go for d one who respects your individuality and your existence..For whom u gonna give ur everything maintain d actual feel of ths relation..!!And if you can't find/maintain....don't go for it....life is yours..live it for full..:) thr are so many things to do:):):):)Think wisely..!!

The biggest most widely sought after advantage is probably the ability to raise children in a family. Having said that, there are thousands of children here in the US waiting to be adopted (and yes singles can adopt, you just have to ask). The dream is having hubby support you and the growing kids while you begin a career, then interrupt to raise family, then when you get good and ready go back to work, and wonder why your salery is not as high as the people around you who didn't get a chance to take time off.No one can decide that one but you. for that matter, you can select a nice guy and ask him to be the biological father. Although he might think you are just after child support. (I am not sure it is legal to write a contract that says that the man who is the bio father is not on the hook for child support. If that is the case no dad is going to want to sire the pups, and then pay child support, without being a functioning father in the family.In most other respects, being single, with or w/o children, wouldn't be much different that a man in the same condition.Are there other issues that you are thinking are potential pros or cons?

Definitely do what you want. Even if it is still viewed as a bad thing, please do what you want. I'm not sure about this either. But, please consider the following. You're saying you'll date and therefore you won't be lonely. Please don't mistake having random company for not being lonely. You might be perfectly happy, but lots of people feel very lonely even wíth a relationship..let alone if you don't have someone 'to come home to'. You might find comfort in friendships, but: they might get partners of their own and even children, and therefore have less time for the friendship. Another thing: if you date, and even if you don't date...you could fall in love, you know. Just as much as people can't 'decide' that they'll be married, because they can't be sure to find someone that will make that happen, you can't be sure someone won't sweep you off your feet and maybe even change your mind about marriage. And also: a relationship isn't the same as marriage...i'm not sure which you mean exactly. Either way, keep all this in mind.

Honestly, being unmarried isn't bad at all. You have total freedom with out worrying about someone else. If you reside here in the USA, marriage isn't what it used too be. It's no longer encouraged to remain married rather the courts are now teaching "how to get a peaceful divorce". However, if you wish to have children. It would be a good idea to have a partner to help your raise them. Just something to think about. And, NO it is not considered to be a negative if a woman chooses not to be married. If you do not have the desire to marry then dont. Why put yourself through the headache if its not what you desire. Forget about what others think. Its your life. No one is living it except you. So do what makes you happy...period!

Fabulous! I do what I want, when I want, which whom I want. I have a great job, a master's degree and do lots of volunteer work. I have a dog that is the woof of my life and my soul mutt. (If I had had her first I wouldn't have had to bother with the marriage and divorce). I play with my 14 nieces and nephews and 16 great nieces and nephews and when they are hungry, angry, tired and messy I give them back to their parents! I take a 2 week trip to Europe annually. I never have to put on pants, shop, cook or clean the house. LOTS more women should consider staying single.
Life of an unmarried woman?
As a single working mother in the U.S., I've done well -- my son is now an adult. The choice is yours to live as you want to live. I would, however, counsel you to be open just in case you meet someone that fits with you.  I also had several "spinster" aunts who lived fulfilled lives until their 80s. They never married, one stayed home to take care of aging parents and one was a high powered finance executive. They were very close sisters. The role models are out their for whatever lifestyle you choose. The choice is yours.
In addition to culture and tradition, marriage is a security licence for women. Under the present living conditions, unmarried women have to face more dificulties than married women. Every country have to develop and provide separate security system for women, till that is achieved, woman living alone is not safe.

Consider this story.Let say a boy of age 25 decided no to marry. He has family (mother, father, sister, brother & relatives). He has got good friends also. He is just 25 and have a job and earning well. He is enjoying every bit of his life. Does he need anyone in his life to make him happy. No, of course not. He goes office, he works and had lot of fun there. He came back home in evening and spend time with family and siblings. Its all fun being in he family.Weekends he hangout with crazy friends. Movies, parties, events, shopping, trip and what not... I told you- “He is enjoying every bit of his life”5 yrs laterHe is 30- most of the friends are either married or committed to any girl or relocated to other city due to Job. Weekend hangout is not as much as it used to be. He got few more friends in office but they are just friends. Sister already got married and living a happy life with husband, he talk with her sister over phone and sometimes visit her house. His brother also got married and got a small cute kid. Father and mother are older now, their health is a concern now.10 yrs laterHe is 35. All of his friends are married. They have got kid and family to look after, so no more weekend fun or trip with friends. They are not as much in contact as they used to be previously. He feel little lonely as friends are busy, people around him in office are either young or married. He can’t stare at girls, as he feel little older. Her sister and brother has got kid and family too to look after. They are little busy in their life. His father is no more. Mother is lying on bed always due to health issue. She needs constant help and care, He sits by her side and try to help her find some happiness.15 yrs laterHe is 40 now. He looks like a middle aged man (a 25 yrs old boy call him uncle).

Brother is busy in taking care of his family as he got two kids and wife. Both kids going to school. People in society and relatives do bitching about him being a single. Mother is no more now. She passed away a year before. He miss her mother. He is a lonely guy now. He sleeps alone in loneliness.20 yrs laterHe is 45 now. He has already quit his JOB and gave most of his savings to his brother for his kids. Half of his head hairs are either gone or turned white. He looks little older. There is very less talk between brothers (No personal issue, it is just that they don’t have mush to share). He rarely talk to her sister or meet her. He walk alone on road, sleep alone and eat alone. He is part of his brother’s family but feels alone most of the time.25 yrs laterHe is 50 now. His nephew and niece are young and energetic now. They are busy in their friends, party & college. He remembers his young days seeing them.He reads few books on life and spirituality to pass the time. He uses power glass to read as his eye sight is week now. He rarely meet anyone. He has no hopes or any desire from life.

Do introvert men live a better life by staying unmarried?
Which is better? Getting married or staying single?
If you ask this question to any married person , his / her reply would be “ don't marry, be happy “ .It's your personal decision, whether you wanna marry or be single for life.Speaking in spiritual terms ,, less attachments - less karma and vice versa.When a man marries , he will have the added responsibility of a husband , and eventually a father , and has to fulfill this duties upto his last breath !!On the contrary , if he is single , then he would not have this duties of husband and father , thus will have less attachments…The more attachments , the more karma ,, and thus you will never have time for introspection of yourself (knowing who you are) and you will be always in this illusionary world (maaya ).Good luck ☺
There is nothing good or bad exist in the world,its all about individual's perception towards that.To marry or to be single is only and only your choice.If you want to marry then you should have your desicion,your own understanding of pros and cons of marriage & it's associated responsibility & restriction.Same thing applied to be single also.Its not easy thing to sustain single if you don't have any plan to tackle loneliness and sickness of partner.You have to be very busy with your choices and likes so you do not feel miss or sick of anybody particularly for physical need as it's most desired & uncontrolled things in life.So give lots of thought then decide best for you.Never decide anything under any influence or under anybody's advise or experience.
Words from JOHN DUMELODon't marry for sex,don't marry because you are of age.don't marry because you are getting old,don't marry because you are lonely,don't marrybecause you need someone to support youfinancially,don't marry because you mistakenly got pregnant.don't marry because you don't want tolose the person,don't marry because of familypressures,don't marry because you like the idea of marriage and admire every wedding gown you see.don't marry because all your friends are gettingmarried.But get married because you are in love, get married cos he or she is your best friend and when that love is no more , he or she can still make you smile.-John DumeloRest everyone is capable of deciding self\U0001f62c\U0001f62cThank you

Sometimes we feel dat it's good to live unmarried becoz it's related to many responsibilities and also becoz we need freedom.But as life is like a bicycle and we have to balance it well, so it's good to get married and take new responsibilities for the future. In everyone’s life dat phase comes where we need a soulmate so it's good to get married with the right person.
No,I think it's not a good idea to stay unmarried for whole life. Eventually time will come when we ll b no longer strong mentally as well as physically. At dat tym,we want someone to hold our hand and stand by our side. No one can do dat better than a life partner.

I am a guy and not a fan of  getting married. It is hard to convince your parents  bcoz they think it is next to impossible to stay unmarried. For you I would say first become financially independent and than move to other city. Else, if you stay with your parents stay unmarried then sooner or later there will be a lot of problems and pressure.

My 35 years of unmarried life has been good with the usual ups and downs.My life choices should work for me. People, ofcourse will have their opinions but this is my life. I am currently in a relationship but I have been single a lot in my life. Being single has been very important for me in developing myself, interests, friendships, career and opinions. I think its necessary to become comfortable with who you are before you can truly be with somebody for marriage or otherwise.I don’t worry if guests/staff in restaurants look at me as the only solo diner (Table for just one???!!!)I don’t worry if I am the only single person in a movie theatre.I don’t worry (but I do get annoyed) when my colleague’s (with a wife and children) long weekend request gets prioritized over mine.The importance of marriage in our society today is dwindling. There is no guarantee for lifelong companionship just because you are married. Fear of being alone is not a good enough reason for me.If you choose to stay unmarried that is a perfectly valid choice just like how getting married is another valid choice.

For a person to mature spiritually and emotionally he/she needs to get married.One thinks one can be free of all problems if one remains unmarried. But that is not the case. A person who is unmarried will get ill will need hospitalisation etc. Hence family is essential.Having a life partner and kids do try your tolerance level. It teaches you to be compassionate, tolerant and selfless. It makes you think of others before you think of yourself.This helps you grow mentally emotionally and spiritually.I thought I did not need to marry as I was happy on my own. I got seriously ill and could not get up to make a cup of tea for myself or leave aside get a glass of water for myself. After a few days I got stuck in a traffic jam and walked a long distance,changed buses and reached home around 10.30 pm. That day I realised that any car could hit me and I could die. The MCD would cremate me as an unknown person as my identity papers would get stolen along with my money. No one was there who would come looking for me.These two incidents changed my mind. I realised that I was being selfish, by not trying to fulfil my purpose in life. This was 1996 March/April. Once you start think in a particular way, the universe moves to fulfil your wish. I met my would be husband in August 1996 and we were married in February 1997.

If we look at behaviors of people all across the world, we will find that ex-communication and solitary confinement are almost a universal way of punishing another person. It is considered one of the most painful punishments ever, without even physically touching the person! Sad and amazing all at once! I think this shows that no matter how much humans like to profess their independence, we are inherently social beings, and actually suffer greatly when deprived of human contact. Even those people I know who live alone and say they never want to get married/remarry etc. always have a pet, or they try to fill their life with a sort of ersatz human interaction in the form of watching a lot of TV, multiplayer games, joining forums, etc. The sad thing I've noticed is that these people start to isolate themselves, so their social skills decline, then when they meet people, they alienate them, and when they feel that,  they become disheartened and isolate themselves more. It can turn into a bad cycle. One does not have to be a blind sheep just to have friends, but I think it is always good to be affiliated with a "tribe" that can look out for you, protect you, and be there to celebrate the joys of your life. If you have this with your group of friends/relatives, I suppose that is fine. However, in the United States, at least, friendship is quite different than in other countries--people rarely hang out with their friends everyday, they can't just walk to the corner to meet their buddies---so I think having a partner takes on even more importance here. Unfortunately, our chances of finding a partner are not equal at all ages--so it is better to start young, when you have a maximum choice of mates, and also, you can build more memories with that one lucky person. :)
I have been alone for most of my adult life. Most of the time that I wasn't alone I was with someone who made me feel like I was alone. Being in a relationship with a person who really cared about me was better than either. And being with a person who made me feel alone was the worst of the three. No relationship stays in the initial adoration phase. But as long as you find one that can continue to be healthy and mutually fulfilling I would say go for it. I've always liked being alone, but as I've gotten older, it's gotten worse. Right now I don't enjoy being alone. I wish I had someone to just spend time with. I want to have someone who is there for me when I need someone to talk to or even to sit quietly with. I want to know that if something were to happen to me, there would be someone that would care for me. I want to know that if I can't do something on my own there is someone who will help me with it. I want to have someone who will tell me that something I am doing doesn't make any sense. I want someone there who enjoys my company and wants me around. I want to have intimate sex with someone who I care about to fill an emotional need, not just sex with someone I hardly know just to fill a physical need.I want to share my life with someone in every way. I want a partner in crime even if that crime is just downloading copyrighted material. I want someone who appreciates the things I do for them as much as I appreciate the things she does for me. I want someone to inspire me to do more for myself I want a reason to wake up in the morning.I want a reason to go to bed at night.I want to be desired and to desire someone else.
Well i can certainly blame the women of today for this since they’re so very picky today when it comes to having a relationship since most of the time the women out there these days want men with a lot of money since they like getting very expensive gifts from these men as well. Many women nowadays are real Golddiggers since it is all about money for them since they will never at all go with many of us good men that don’t make a lot of money but enough to get by which it is good enough for us. Most of the women now are nothing at all like the real good old fashioned women were which most of the women back then were the very best of all and they really did put these women today to real shame as well. The women in those days didn’t really have any money at all since both the men and women at that time were struggling just to make ends meat and they really Accepted one another for who they were which today i will admit that women today have choices. But this is the real reason why many of us good single men are still Not married today since it is the women nowadays that are very high maintenance, independent, selfish, spoiled, greedy, picky, narcissists, and very money hungry that have caused many of us men to be single since we really Can’t blame ourselves at all either. If i had a choice which i definitely would’ve been married with my own good wife and family today which i am very sure that many other men will agree with me as well since it does Take Two To Tango Today.

I have also been single for most of my adult life. Ironically, the only person that has been encouraging me to find someone to date is my ex-boyfriend. I'm not sure why, since he has been adamant about not wanting to be in a long term relationship ever, and has stated that as the main reason why he broke up with me. I have the feeling that you are a very young person. Probably in your early 20s. The best advice I can give you, is to respect your own feelings. If you feel content in your life as it is, then that's a very good sign. It means you're not looking for contentment outside of yourself. You're not relying on anything or anyone to make you happy, and that's a good thing, because happiness comes from within yourself, and not from anyone else.There's an old fashioned idea that dating or marrying someone will somehow complete you as a person.  This myth is perpetuated by older generations as a method to propagate the human race (even though the planet is already overcrowded as it is). If you want proof of people who look for happiness outside of themselves by dating or marrying, and realize their mistake too late, you don't have to go very far.  I'm sure such people exist all around you, and I'm sure they were also pressured into dating/ or marrying and wish they'd had the confidence to find the contentment they wanted within themselves before they involved someone else in their life. It may sound like I'm being negative about relationships, but honestly, I do believe in the value of a positive relationship, as long as you're in the relationship for all the right reasons, none of which include being in that relationship in order to be "happy". Take care of your own happiness and make it a priority, then, if or when you feel it's the right time for you, you may choose to find someone to form an interdependent partnership with. Someone who encourages and inspires you in life and earns your trust and confidence. some of us never find that person and that's OK too. The point is that we don't need to rely on another person to supply our happiness.  A good relationship should add to our life, not complete it.
I certainly don’t and it is scaring me a bit. I donno if my opinion will help you or if I am just annoying people here ( if I a I am sorry) .I am just so happy being alone ( been this way for three years ) and it is scary because I don’t know in what direction society is heading under these circumstances.I live in the UK and around here it seems like all marriages break down, and you need to be really lucky to find someone decent to be with.If you want to be alone forever I say go with it. You can find people to hang out with and to be intimate with without the whole marriage and committed relationship sha-bang. I think it is much more fun to know a lot of people and have all types of different experiences instead of just sticking to that one person, who is likely to leave you anyway. I treat everyone with respect and empathy I don’t treat people unkindly.Stay single! There are plenty of people out there making babies.
I don't know if this is helpful, but I had the same experience with people telling me to go out and start dating. I divorced my ex husband in 1987, and since I had three children to raise on my own, I was too tired to do anything except come home from work, take care of them and fall into bed. That changed when they all grew up and left the house. I was totally unprepared for that. I couldn't believe how quiet my life became. I cried at night after my last child left for about six months, but then something changed within me. I discovered that I liked living alone. I didn't have to negotiate what to eat for dinner, what movies to watch or music to listen to. I could sit in my recliner and fall asleep without being disturbed, go different places without anyone asking "Where did you go?" or "When are you coming home?" And best of all, I have the bathroom all to myself! It was, and still is marvelous. I love my children so much, but I also love having my autonomy and private space. And I'm not lonely. People still bug me about dating, and I was in a relationship for a while. But we broke up. I love my independence more than him, and he sensed that. Sometimes I miss him. But most of the time, I'm grateful that I can live exactly the way I want to live.
One of our life-long friends is now living with a woman. They got together when he was 55 yrs old. She is near his age, they are a great couple and very well matched. This is what he told me. "I wish I hadn't been so afraid to try a relationship. I'm really happy"It doesn't matter if you remain single. It's sad if you refuse to accept love and happiness because of some idea or principle you've held.Many people remain single their complete lives. Very few remain that way, without some other significant relationship in their lives. Maybe it will be with a sibling or parent, or with a community (whether it be religious, or secular), or even just living with a partner.

Hi there. I am a 34 year old educated single woman and just recently I am starting to feel the weight and magnitude of having no one. I was never worried because I had a nice career and feel like the right relationship comes when it comes. You can’t force it. I’m also a happy and empathic person and Ive never lacked male attention since I was a teen, but I did start dating late (23) because I was raised very protective.Fast forward 10 years I have three broken relationships and several situationships with guys who wasted my time, lied to, abused, used and betrayed me and I might sound bitter but I heartily wish them the magnitude of all the tears I cried and more deeply. I was innocent and naive and the damage and cost on my person are substantial. I’m still a kind and softhearted person but at this point Im so mad I couldn’t care less and gotten to the point where I resent hearing the words I love you or I care for you because the same arms that held me broke me.Nevertheless I used to pick myself up somehow and am happy with my friends and family and career.The moments I’d feel annoyed were generally the moments in between dating/ relationships that people ( colleagues, landlord) would rudely joke or keep on asking about my relationship status ( seriously, what is wrong with people? ‍♀️) sex life or when I was planning to have babies and act like something was wrong with me. I’ve changed jobs and apartments since then ( life’s too short).Anyway. Now I’m not married and have never felt so unsettled. Why? Because Im so tired of waiting for the right person and want to have a baby so much and am running out of time. Where is he? It’s now dawned on me that women have roughly 15 to 20 years to find the right guy if they want kids and that’s as real as the sun coming up every morning. Its such a harsh and unfortunate reality. It drives me mad and I wake up sobbing in the middle of the night and have frequent nightmares. I’m seriously thinking of lowering my standards ( I don’t like these words because people are who they are and I would never feel myself better than anyone) because I don’t want to be alone anymore. There’s no better feeling than cuddling up to your partner at night and getting a forehead kiss or spooning while watching a movie. I’m currently between jobs and I’ve lost all my motivation. I’m not even applying anymore or thinking about the future ( I’m not yet where I want to be). I feel like I wouldn’t be able to function well at work like this and nobody is ( rightly so) waiting for a depressed colleague anyway.I’ve had options but what to choose between unemployed with zero motivation, uneducated, have no intent of ever wanting to leave their parents home ( mommas boy) and want you to come live in, drug addicts, irresponsible, etc.. Some romantic prospects also didn’t work out because of our careers, life goals etc. Those are people I’m still friends with.Anyway despite everything I’d like to say to everybody there is no perfect way. Marrying early, marrying late, having kids, not having them, it’s all personal. Follow your heart and make the best of what you can. To the shy people I would say you can always turn your life around by following some courses to become more assertive etc.. Also cosmetic surgery is an option. Life is short. Do not deny yourself anything that is within your means to change. I wouldn’t. When I go I’ll go bruised and beaten but in the knowledge that I followed my heart and kicked life back in the butt :) All the best to you all.

I'm 48 and have never married though I have been asked many times (got engaged twice, then called it off because I realised my reasons to accept were suspect).  So far, I haven't met someone I really truly want to spend the rest of my days with. Here are my thoughts and motivations on being unmarried:1. I love my own company. In fact, I need those hours of solitude and without it, I feel out of balance.2. Though I'm single, I have a very active family life with regular interactions with my siblings, their partners, my nephews, nieces, cousins in addition to close friends. And no, I don't have to wait for them to include me in their family activities. Most events that involve my extended family happen at my home. Right now I'm enjoying the quiet and relaxation from after the festive season celebrations that included Christmas luncheon and two barbecues at my house and plenty of visits with family members and friends. I have a large home with plenty of guest rooms for visiting friends, nephews, cousins and siblings and their families. What I'm trying to say is that, being unmarried does not preclude an active family life if that's what suits you. 3. Being unmarried means you don't need to consider anyone else when you want to do something major- like travel. I'm a mobile worker, so I can easily ( and do) travel for work, to get away for some quiet and relaxation or to visit my large family . I've been known to rent a place for a month in cities/towns where my family or friends live and then get on with my life, spending time with them or maybe not socialising at all, whatever suits me.4. Being married and having children is no guarantee that you will not be alone in your old age. Children grow up and move clear across the country for work or because they choose to. They may even move to other countries. Partners divorce or pass away. Lots of old people are alone and lonely even though they married and raised families.5.  Just because I'm unmarried doesn't mean I wouldn't choose to, if the right guy came  along. But as an adult woman who has built a rich life for myself (not necessarily money), I have a great deal to compromise if I marry. That person would have to offer me something extraordinary to tempt me to a commitment. But I'm not unaware that a companion walking with me through this life and showing me new pathways I was unaware of would enrich my life further.6. I have a huge respect for the institution of  marriage. I was born of a couple that was happily married for 0ver 40 years, till death parted them.  My siblings are well-partnered too. So my experience of marriage, albeit a secondary one, has been very good. So I'm not unmarried because I have something against marriage. 7. Old age is what you make of it, and it doesn't have  to be alone and lonely. I live part-time in a village where old people are very active in community affairs and do a myriad of activities to keep busy and active ( play soccer, walk everywhere, meet, help out in wedding preparations... gosh. The elderly are very busy here and integrated into the daily life of the young too). Honestly, old people in this village have a hectic schedule and you'd have more time to yourself if you were young with a fulltime job.

​February 18, 2016 UPDATE: When I posted my answer below, I had no idea of the positive responses that it would get. I didn't seriously think anyone would read it or comment.  I posted it as a lark.What I didn't know then was that I would be treasuring each of those memories and moments so much these past 4 days, because today I was just diagnosed with Stage 3 Lung Cancer.   I have never smoked, I don't drink, do drugs or even caffeine.  I excercise regularly.  My doctors say I am in excellent health, except for the cancer.  I share this to say to all of you, LIVE THE LIVE YOU LOVE with no regrets as I have.  You never know how quickly it might disappear.  I wish you well on your journeys!Love, AnnetteI've been single all my life and I'm now 62 years old. Yes, I've dated, but I've not ever wanted to marry or have children. It was not what I was put on this earth to do.“The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.” ~ Mark TwainI know why I'm here.It's not like no one's ever asked. I've been asked to get married once in my 20's. Another time, this narcissistic guy (whom I didn't even consider a date) had plans that we were going to get married.  Sheesh! I'll spare you the details.I agree with what a few others have said here. Being voluntarily single is awesome. I've gotten to have the life of my dreams, a successful career, travel and to live where I want to.  One day I started a list of all the fun stuff I've done.  I read it when I think I'm not doing anything with my life.Here it is - remember, I've lived a long time!Concerts I've attendedJames Taylor (3 times, including once with Carol King) Ravi Shankar - famous Indian Sitar player...who taught George Harrison sitar John Mellancamp - twiceJudy Collins Carol King (with James Taylor) Joan Baez Bob Dylan Tony Bennett Neil Diamond Josh GrobanBob Seger - I heard him twice about 40 years apart...he played a concert at my High School football stadium Dizzy Gillespie - jazz trumpet Pablo Casals - classical Spanish guitar Elton John Paul McCartney Phil Keaggy - Christian guitar afficinado Joshua Bell - violinist Bruce Molsky - fiddler Janis Ian Livingston Taylor - James Taylor’s brother Muddy Waters - blues Leo Kotke - guitaristJimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer BandPeter Mayer GroupChicagoThe Doobie Brothers Reba McIntyreGeorge Winter - New Age pianistPete Seeger - folk singerLeon RussellBeauSoleil - Cajun bandPeter, Paul and MaryCrosby, Stills and Nash-twiceRachel Barton-Pine - violinistThe Chenelle Sister - a fun, retro girl group from Ann Arbor who do Big Band era songsRicky Skaggs - CountryJohn Hartford - CountryMichael Martin Murphey - CountryHoyt Axton - CountryEdwin McCain - one hit wonderBlue Man GroupCirque de Soleil - "Love"Natalie McMaster - Cape Breton fiddler - twiceThe Who - this summer!I still want to see Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana and Sting in concert.Speakers/Authors in personJane PauleyTimothy Leary - the LSD guruJane GoodallJon Kabat Zinn -trained with him in Mindfulness Based Stress ReductionDawson Church -trained with him for clinical EFTCarl Rogers - father of client centered psychotherapyIrvin Yalom - wrote the book on group therapyMaya Angelou - poet, actress, social activistMaxine Hong Kingston Robert Thurman - Buddhist scholar (and father of Uma Thurman)Daniel Brown -trained with him at Esalen - Harvard professor and Buddhist meditation teacherJoseph Goldstein - Buddhist meditation teacherJean Shinoda Bolen - autograph onlyJames Hollis - Jungian psychologistGary Craig - Founder of EFTMich Albon - author of Tuesdays with Morrie, The 5 People You Meet in HeavenJean Houston - psychologist and author of The Possible HumanDaniel J Seigel - psychiatrist who believes in meditation, not medicationGotswami Amit - quantum physicist Charles Tart - transpersonal psychologistRam Dass - formerly Richard Alpert - Tim Leary’s cohort at HarvardNeale Donald Walsh - author of the Conversations with God seriesOriah Mountain Dreamer - author of The Invitation and The DanceCarolyn Myss - intuitive healerJoan Boryshenko - psychologist Marianne Williamson - author of Return to Love - an interpretation of A Course in MiraclesSandra Ingerman - Soul RetrivalDeepak Chopra - physician and authorDavid Feinstein - researcher in EFTJudy Neale - creator of Spirit in BusinessDick Gregory - activistClarrisa Pinkola Estes - author of Women Who Run with the WolvesDavid FeinsteinSandra Ingerman - author of Soul RetrievalAuthors I’ve interviewed on my Radio Show(s)Dawson Church, Ph.D.David Richo, Ph.D.Jennifer Wade, Ph.D.Gregg LevoyJenny Johnston - EFTer from AustraliaAileen NoblePlaces I've Been for Work or Pleasure Oahu, HawaiiBahamasSt. ThomasSt. JohnsTortollaThe Grand CanyonHoover DamHoward Hughes RanchNYCDenver, COOmaha, NEChicago, IL - many times for the theater, museums, and aquariumSeattle, WAPortland, ORSan Diego, CAMonterey, CAEsalen Institute in Big Sur, CASan Francisco, CALas Vegas, NV - 3 times...still, meh...Tuscon, AZWinslow, AZ - yes, I did sing "standing on the corner in Winslow, AZ..."

What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?
Marriage is merely a societal construct and there are thousands of people who choose not to tread that path. Does it make you happier? That solely depends on YOU. I know a woman who chose not to marry. Everyday, she wakes up, goes on a run, makes herself breakfast, gets the most difficult things done at work (no matter how long it takes because there are no familial duties to pressure her), and then celebrates by going to a bar with her friends, dancing her heart out and possibly, meeting more fun people. Her weekends comprise of the most exciting adventures people usually have on their bucket lists- skydiving, scuba diving, visiting homeless shelters, tutoring little children, learning to cook, you name it. "What happens when you turn 50?", I once asked her. "I'll do things that give me the same adrenaline rush and not necessarily a heart attack", she replied confidently. The fact that you're alone, does NOT mean that you're lonely; it means you can be strong enough to conquer the day, conquer the world by yourself.I also knew a woman who never married and spent her entire life wanting to find someone. She would always make sad jokes about her lonely life that evoked pity from everyone around her. She got so tired of her boring daily routine that she began to resent herself. She did nothing to change her situation and badmouthed happy couples behind their backs instead. So it could turn out either way. It's up to you to decide what kind of an unmarried person you want to be. Personally, I don't understand why most people constantly feel the need to have a significant other to complete their lives. Maybe we are scared to be alone, or maybe we need someone who believes in us, who loves us, even when we don't. While all of these reasons are valid to some extent, who says marriage is the only solution?! You can have friends, family and most importantly, YOURSELF, to fall back on. You don't need to wait for love and companionship. Make the most your life; you only need yourself to do that!

What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?"It's not that I don't like people, I just don't like being around uninteresting, unreliable people or drama queens.A little context here.  I think the spirit of the question regards those who have never married and prefer to be alone by choice.  I was married for 21 years before my wife died of cancer in 2012.  However, I've always been a bit of a loner...since before I was married and have been again since my wife passed three years ago.Short version.  Regarding friends.  I do a lot of things on my own because I have unique interests that others might not share. (visiting Lawrence Livermore labs, JPL, observatories, factory tours and museums).  I often find others unreliable, have annoying habits, don't have enough time or money, or that they may become irritating after a few days together.  If I want to go somewhere I hate waiting on others or have to compromise my plans because they aren't interested in some portion of the adventure.  I'd love to have you along but I'm doing this whether you're coming or not. Regarding companionship.  My wife and I were a perfect match and could be joined at the hip for days on end and never get on each others nerves.  Since her passing I've dated a few women but no one is the complete package as my wife was.  I'm now in my 50's and find that anyone in that age group has a lot of baggage...ex husbands, crappy adult kids, health problems, weight problems, money problems and, or they're reluctant to venture too far from their friends or family.I know I'm being very picky about having to have a perfect relationship but I just don't want to compromise very much.  The way I see it I'd rather be alone and deal with the loneliness than make a commitment and be unhappy with some aspect of it.  Am I selfish?  Maybe, but that's the way I roll.Long storyWhen I was in my 20's and prior to meeting my wife I was serving in the military (Coast Guard).  I took advantage of all the benefits the service offered, especially time off to explore the places where I was stationed.  To my friends and shipmates I often proposed ski trips, surfing, hiking, seeing national parks and whatever was in a few days driving distance.Sometimes they didn't want to go on these little adventures, or they didn't have the money, or wanted to just sit around and drink or play video games.  I was determined to take advantage of seeing and doing everything possible even if it meant going alone. I wasn't going to waste the opportunity because of unmotivated people and I knew I would regret not doing these things later in life, so I set off to do and see stuff by myself if necessary.  As a young single guy in my 20's I went on many of these adventures alone.  Sure, sometimes I'd go with a friend or a group, but it was much easier to make my own plans, go when and where I wanted without having to factor in all the problems of getting someone to go along and all the coordination it involved. Often I would meet new people and join them so making new friends wasn't a problem.So where am I now?  Well, after my wife passed I put our house up for sale, used the money to buy a nice motorhome, thinned out all my belongings to things that were necessary and practical.A little context here.  I think the spirit of the question regards those who have never married and prefer to be alone by choice.  I was married for 21 years before my wife died of cancer in 2012.  However, I've always been a bit of a loner...since before I was married and have been again since my wife passed three years ago.Long story short.  Regarding friends.  I do a lot of things on my own because I have unique interests that others might not share.

Often I would meet new people and join them so making new friends wasn't a problem.So where am I now?  Well, after my wife passed I put our house up for sale, used the money to buy a nice motorhome, thinned out all my belongings to things that were necessary and practical.My motorhome..."La Casa Rodante" and my trusty Honda CRV at Death Valley Money...absolutely necessary for a fulfilling life.  (You kids stay in school!). I retired from the CG about 10 years ago.  I have a decent pension, health care paid for and many other benefits through the military.  My wife worked in finance and invested our money well.  We were good savers and disciplined spenders.  So for money my retirement pay just about covers my monthly expenses, I can dip into my investments if needed, I will have social security (as well as a portion of my wife's) and a nice IRA when I'm in my 60's to supplement my income.I have many friends that I visit in my travels...some I grew up with and many more from my time in the CG.  I prefer a small number of close friends rather than dozens of "acquaintances".  I travel a lot and sometimes visit for a few days or weeks up to a few months.  I can always retreat to my RV sanctuary when I wish to.   My sister lives in the SF Bay area and I park at Travis AFB (most large bases have RV parks).  I visit my sis and her kids and explore the Bay Area.  RV parks are great places to make friends quickly.  RV'ers are very practical, good natured, adventurous, quick to share info about places they've visited and offer help with RV problems that may occur.  In a nutshell, they're my tribe now.  We friend one another on Facebook, follow each others adventures and meet up in some cool place when practical.Most recently I've been RV'ing in the Mojave desert.  Through pure serendipity I met up with my dad in Yuma, AZ, met up with an old CG buddy who also has an RV and a met up with a good friend from high school who was also in southern CA.  We all got together and had a nice visit and did all the stuff you do in the desert.I like being alone because it gives me options.  I can get up when I want, watch the TV that I like, eat what I want when I want and get together (or not) with others when I want.  I enjoy visiting with family and friends but I can only take it in small chunks.  Having an RV fits into my lifestyle.  I can visit then come home to my own bed.So, having read and reread this a couple of times it appears that I may be selfish, maybe impatient or a bit of a control freak....maybe I am.  I'd be interested in a professional opinion as to whether or not I need some therapy.  It's just the way I am and being in my 50's now don't think its going to change much.  In my situation, and at my age I kind of feel like I'm just marking time until the day that I leave this life and get to see my wife again.  I so look forward to that day.  Until then I have places to see and things to do...on my schedule.  I'm happy being alone and until a nice girl comes along I will do just fine.Money...absolutely necessary for a fulfilling life.  (You kids stay in school!).

It’s sad.I came from a dysfunctional family, which had downstream effects on my life. I can look at where I am today and trace how the contours of that life led me to being alone today.When I was 5 years old, I was left alone. I went to kindergarten on the bus alone, and came home on the bus alone. I walked home from the bus stop alone. Because it was midday (I went to a half-day school that ended at noon), I’d get hungry. I used a chair to climb the kitchen counters to get peanut butter and bread. Then I’d lay on the kitchen floor, cuddling the family dog, and wait for an adult to come homeI was sexually assaulted by a family acquaintance from age 6 to 10. When I told my parents about the abuse, and asked for help, they didn’t respond to me or comfort me. They didn’t get me help or intervene. I spent half my living memory (my first memories were at age 2) being sexually exploited and terrorized.My father beat me. He would hit me in the face and call me a bitch and a slut. He went into rages for the smallest of infractions. He took my bedroom door off its hinges. He threatened me. He threw things, called me big-ass, and made sexist comments and jokes. In his shadow, I grew up feeling small and afraid.My mother was emotionally and psychologically abusive. She stood by while my father beat me. Then, while I held my bloody face in my hands, she would tell me what a bad person I was. I was awful. I was unlovable. I was difficult. I was angry (who wouldn’t be). When she wasn’t telling me to my face what a terrible child I was, she was leaving hate notes on my bed or in my backpack. (Kind of like a perverse Hallmark commercial.)She bullied me in private and eroded my sense of self worth. She did this by making me wear shabby clothing, poking fun of my looks and my body, and shaming me. When I was a teenager, she sometimes came into the bathroom when I showered and stood there, silently watching over me. It was scary and bizarre. I sometimes questioned whether she had been there or if I had imagined it.I overheard my mother instigating the violent incidents between me and my father. She’d go to him and lie about how bad I was, or conjure stories about how I was disrespectful.Despite these hardships, I managed to do well at school. I escaped the pain of my circumstances by keeping my head buried in my books.College was hard because my parents exploited me financially. They had diverted my financial aid payments to themselves. I was so brainwashed and shell-shocked that I was afraid to confront them. When I eventually did, largely out of desperation, my needs were dismissed and I was called a liar. Later, in an act of vengeance, they stole my computer out of my dorm room. They did some other fucked up stuff to undermine and control me, but it would take too long to write about that here.I graduated, against all the odds. I moved in with my college boyfriend and we planned our future together. My life felt hopeful and promising. Then, a couple of years after graduation, the unthinkable happened. My parents committed a crime.You might think, “I’d never cover up for my awful family,” or “let them suffer the consequences.” But my parents were extraordinarily bad people, and so, too were their fuckups. It was the kind of crime that, if revealed, would hurt people and ruin all of us. My sibling and I were caught up in shitty circumstances that were not of our own design.We hired a lawyer and were advised that we should pay people off and run out the clock on the statute of limitations.My sibling and I dealt with the legal and financial consequences for almost a decade. I had to leave my boyfriend, as I didn’t want him implicated. It was painful to pack up my stuff and leave behind the love of my life, for reasons I couldn’t ever explain. I cried every night for years, and watched him move on to another woman. A part of me died when he married her. Another part of me felt relieved that he’d found love again.I eventually found myself in another relationship, but because I was hiding so much and dealing with so many toxic behaviors, I didn’t attract a good person. My circumstances meant I was often frustrated, scared, anxious and tired. In time, it was easier for me to believe the worst: that I was fucked up because I came from a fucked up family. I carried around their fucked up secrets and fucked up legacy. No one could kind or healthy could love this fucked up girl.Predictably, my next boyfriend abused me. I knew it was unhealthy and made many attempts to leave. He was volatile, though, and I was now under the thumb of my equally volatile family. One day, I asked my parents to help me leave him, while I sobbed into the phone. My mother said it wasn’t her business and she wouldn’t get involved. She hung up on me. I eventually found the courage and resources to leave him on my own.I was terrified to date again. I spent five years abstaining from sex and relationships, focusing on recovery from the abuse and survival — a task made all the more difficult, given the fact that I was living with a terrible secret that I couldn’t discuss in therapy. But eventually, the statute of limitations had ended.At the end of this, my sibling and I had paid exhorbitant amounts of hush money and legal fees. I realized that I had wasted my youth and some prime earning years. I woke up and I realized that I was sad, scared, broke, old and alone.My friends had married, had children, reached their professional and financial goals, while I had languished in my own private hell. It hurt that my circumstances made it hard to be a “together” person. I knew that my friends privately wondered why someone smart and ambitioud could turn out to be so unhinged.When I recently had a health issue that required support, my parents didn’t feel any obligation to me. They abandoned me and left me on my own. And my sibling lives too far away to be able to help,I was in free fall and it was terrifying. I survived and got through it, but it was not easy. Aside from my material needs, there were moments when I yearned for affection, reassurance, a loving and healing touch. It made me realize that I was truly alone, and, save for my one sibling, always had been.I would like to fall in love at 40 and create a life with someone. To have a chance at a healthy family. To create the loving environment I never had, and to share my love with another person.I’ve done the hard work of unraveling the past and coming to terms with it through intensive trauma therapy. I’ve “re-parented” myself, healed my wounds of neglect (as best as one can, anyway) and tried to create a life of integrity. I’ve focused on my inner and outer beauty, and remained open to people without attaching a lot expectations to outcomes.I was hopeful at first. But modern dating is hard and even harder when you’re 40. So I’m still alone. I’ve come to terms with it and just tried to be happy where I am. Fortunately, I’ve learned how to be alone and to create some joy in my life. I volunteer, give my time to people hurting more than I am, and have made a chosen family out of my dearest and closest friends.There are times that I grieve. Occasionally, I’ll lie in bed and the still of the night feels oppressive and hard to bear. It feels so, so unfair. I sob for what was lost and what will never be.When these days come, I comfort myself by pretending that there’s someone who listens and cares. I talk to myself aloud and recount my story, while imagining a sympathetic other. They’re compassionate and understanding. They acknowledge my loss, they say all the right things.I guess that sounds a little crazy, but loneliness and isolation can be a crazy-making situation.
What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?
I am seriously warning you against taking any consideration of answers posted by anybody here including me. I am 23 and have never been in a relationship, so I am not at all qualified to answer your question, but seriously! Are others?Most of the people answering the question are with their own narrow cultural perspective. In western countries marriage is trial and failure. It's something they desire (a successful and long lasting one), but not necessarily need. They can go on fall in love at 40's and keep dating in 50's. Whereas in eastern countries it's a compulsion. Most people marry practical strangers with their family's approval. But marriages hardly break and end in divorce. Why am I stressing on this cultural difference? Choice!!! If you have a choice of things and you can choose any one of these lives, it will not impact you harshly. But as soon as you miss the train you will be devastated if you make a wrong decision. So, that much for how long you can remain in this dilemma. I now come to your real question.What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?Incredibly lonely!!! You may think that you will enjoy life, have cool friends ... blah...blah. But just ask me one thing. Suppose this new year you want to spend with your friend and so does her wife who is with him for last 30 years. Who is bound to be left alone on such many occasions?  You won't have that special somebody who will regard you as their world.Moreover, the fun will end one day. Whatever you may like today, you will not love doing the same thing 20 years from hence. Sad part - you want to have anybody with you to share this. Again the people you see who are very happy despite being single are very highly driven ones. They have married their professions. But for every single successful person you can find, you will find 100 committed people who are more successful and have led happier lives.Yeah, granted not all married people have happy lives. But when they grow old at least they will have somebody to share their regrets and mistakes with, if not the happy moments. Believe me, after a certain time you will certainly lose your beauty, then your health and then you will be cold and there will be no charm, friendliness in you. Your parents or siblings might be dead or not with you. But there will be this one person you grew old with. With whom you shared so much that now you care not how they look, feel or say. You love them for what they are. And then one of you may die earlier than the other. The other one will come to farewell on your last journey. Is it not worth it? Is not breaking your heart a couple of times worth it?Your answer:Negative Case:You will be lonely, sad, and regretful of life. If unlucky, also unhealthy. Probably hire somebody to look after yourself. And end up giving everybody to your caretaker because you have no one to pass on your legacy.Positive Case:You will have a very eventful life full of buzz. You will be busy most of your time working and accomplishing a lot. You may not miss anybody. Then you will sometimes come back home. Or too sick or old to work. Then you again will be lonely.
some context on why i am eligible to give answer-this year end I will be 33I am staying alone since 2012, alone means I share flat but I go out alone for movies and dinner.I work from home and sometimes it is like for 2 weeks the only person whom i get to interact is my cook.why I am unmarried when all my friends have kids?My parents are handling matrimonial profile from last 6–7 years.height- 5’6”complexion- wheatish brown, gets tan very easily and add-on is oily sweaty skin ( my parents keep asking me to mention it wheatish in matri profile whereas others see it as dark )salary- more than enoughResponse received on matri- Not a single family meeting could be arranged during these years on matriReason- I don’t know, nobody showed interest, those who accepted interest didn’t communicated to proceed further.Met couple of girls by contacting them myself on a different matri account, they all said no in first meeting and yes they didn’t offer to split the bill.Relationships in life - zeroDates so far - 3 girls from north east, yes only 3 dates in 6 years on tinder/truly-madly/aisle, seems girls from north east don’t care much about complexionAfter analyzing the response on matri and dating apps, i know i am not getting marriedNow people will say sometimes you have to lower your expectations-right, but considering the response received in matri market, I don’t see any value in lowering the expectations to such a level that you end up whining whole life in an uncertain private job to make money for kids born out of an unattractive partner because nobody else said YES. I don’t see any point in that, others may have different opinion.So how it is to stay unmarried and alone? - so far it has not been that bad, recently joined a new company, working on new stuff, doing workout, keeping track of macros and calories, last Sunday watched john wick, this Sunday Chernobyl, started planning early retirement.how would it be to stay unmarried and alone? - not sure about how would it be like after 5, 10 or 20 years, all i know is there are few things you can’t control, it is not necessary that you get to experience everything what others get, also it is not necessary to get into every fight like partner is cheating when you are coding in office.What about emotional health and balance? - better do not depend on someone for emotional balance, learn to be at ease and peace, you can train your mind, train your mind to think what you want it to think.when unmarried, you could do more in life, you could choose to do something for society after taking early retirement, there is lot to do in big country India, you will never get bored alone.Key would be to keep yourself in the best possible state- best state of mind, health and bank balance.
What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?
I'm a 30-year-old woman, never married, childless, and am splitting time between summer holidays at home with my parents in Southeast Asia, and the rest of the year doing my masters in a "Western" country, where I live with flatmates. I'm an involuntarily celibate straight demisexual... which means that I like only men but do not experience sexual attraction unless I've developed emotional attachment first, and that I prefer to be part of a couple but been unable to find a sexual partner/engage in sexual activity for reasons beyond my control. My last long-term relationship ended 3, almost 4 years ago, and I haven't been able to find someone else since.For the most part, my single life since 27 has been awesome. I quit my job and became a travel writer. I'm working out and taking good care of myself. I'm currently on a prestigious scholarship that provides me the opportunity to live in between countries and gaining some enriching experiences and perspectives. I'm studying a subject I deeply care about, and traveled some more as part of researching my thesis. I wrote a book and am in the process of fine editing for publishing next week. I'm collaborating with a visual artist, a filmmaker, and musicians, to tell the story of my book through other media and engage a wider audience with a beautiful message we strongly believe in. Financially I'm doing relatively well, and I believe it will only get better from here. And I'm dreaming bigger dreams for the coming few years: writing more books, get my own column in a prominent newspaper or magazine, found a tech startup and a clothing company, set up a philanthropic initiative, and travel some more to create, inspire, and collaborate.I am proud of who I've become, and I wouldn't give this up for a marriage.That said, ever since I hit my late teens/early twenties, I've had this innate desire for marriage and children, and it has only grown stronger over time. I love being in love with a man I genuinely admire and respect—it is a rare occurrence though—and always hoped that I'll find my "happily ever after". I believe I'd make a great partner and wife, and people who know my track record in relationships would confirm that I'm one who makes deliberate effort to appreciate my partner, communicates concerns in a diplomatic and considerate way, actively listens and gives my undivided presence, defines my principles and stands up for them, fights fair in conflicts, forgives each other, dreams future goals together and committing to them, be by my partner's side when the going gets tough, takes good care of the home and is well versed in doing the "business" side of the relationship (finances, property, responsibilities). So in my view, I deserve to be married because I can bring a lot to the table and make someone's life happier and more beautiful. But that also means that I deserve someone who can and will commit to doing as much for me as I do for him, and accepts the life I've been living before he came into the picture. I won't marry a man who says, "Party's over, no more long solo travels and writing career for you. Now make me dinner and give me a blow job because as your husband now I call the shots over your life." Though my life will undoubtedly change after marriage and kids, the man I marry has to appreciate the life and person I've developed into over all these years, encourage me to continue being who I am, and would dream new dreams with me (that includes him and kids in the picture) that respects the continuation of that life path I've built way before he came into the picture.Despite my desire for marriage, since I was a little girl I've developed a strong aversion to patriarchy (the system in which men hold the dominant power, unfairly subjecting women to serve men's interests at the expense of their own). Being brought up in a conservative Christian household, I've been taught that in order for a marriage  and motherhood to work, women need to tolerate a little bit of patriarchy because that's "God's way." I later became an agnostic after my parents separated due to my father's affair with another woman, and got back together because apparently my mother can't live without him (and wanted to "obey God's will," avoiding ostracising from the church community that's become the centre of her universe.)In addition to these, I had a sex-negative upbringing (meaning that as an adolescent I was discouraged from expressing attraction to boys and developing relationships with them). When I finally had my first relationship at ages 18-19, I got myself an abusive boyfriend while living away from my family and friends on the other side of the world. My life got better at 21-22... in hindsight I probably should have spent those early prime years prioritising finding a partner... but I was broke, fighting personal demons and trying to start my life over, so I figured that it was only responsible to make myself better first before opening up to a relationship.When I was 24, I started a 3-year relationship with a guy who had been a good friend since I was 18, and was there for me when I was breaking up with my abuser. I thought he was the love of my life and was preparing to marry him. Unfortunately he wasn't willing to deal with my past or plan a future, just wanted to clip my wings when I try to dream, and always had to prove that he's smart and I'm dumb... which in hindsight, I guess, is a form of abuse as well. But of course nobody else sees it because he's otherwise a gentle, polite and nice guy with a great, respectable career--other people generally think he's a good man and my father had high hopes on him. Anyway, the life I'm living now is one that I've been dreaming about ever since I was with him... and I dreamed it in such a way hoping that the things I do would teach me how to be a great wife for him (read paragraph 4). I chose a writing career because it gives me the flexibility to work from home and immerse my children in my world as I teach them life lessons, values, and how to dream their future. I have no fear that being married or having children would take away the awesome life I'm living now--though it will mean that I'll have to start planning my life around them and be creative in providing for them experiences that make them fall in love with life itself. If anything, I want the opportunity to let marriage and children transform the life I have right now into something more enriching--even if it means constantly keeping my ego in check, putting up with pet peeves, making financial sacrifices, and dealing with dirty diapers. But my pre-condition for saying "yes" to marriage is that my spouse would have to be willing to accommodate the things I believe matter most to life--both by being part of it, and by giving me the freedom to feed my soul as an individual (so that I have life and spark to colour his world and that of our children).I've since yet to find a man who's willing to share that kind of life with me. When I was 22, good prospectable single men were all over me, but at 27-28 they're all suddenly gone. The next boyfriend I had was a 3-month fling from work, with whom I shared great chemistry, who expressed the closest thing I've ever had to a partner supportively believing in my dreams, encouraged me to be a better person, and led me on to believe that he was in love with me. So I developed real feelings for him, which I expressed liberally when I thought it was mutual... only to find out later that he didn't mean it. This fling, so far, is the only man I've ever slept with (the other guy I almost married was a practicing Christian who intended to have us "save ourselves"... so when we broke up after 3 years without ever kissing or having sex, I surprisedly felt defeminised and extremely hurt). When my fling left, what hurts most was the impression that he gave up on me because I'm not worth fighting for. It made me feel that there's something inherently defective with me. If there's nothing wrong with me, then how come men don't love me and won't commit to me? I feel like I'm that gorgeous mansion on a secluded cliff outlooking the sea--the kind everyone says they want but nobody actually buys because it's too expensive, requires high maintenance, and takes effort getting to and from. Everytime a prospective buyer decides against buying the mansion, I renovate and make it an even nicer place to call home. But instead of attracting new buyers I scare my prospects even more because I just added extra zeros behind the price and won't settle for less. At best, I get renters who would hire the proverbial mansion to host parties over the weekend but won't lift a finger to clean up their mess. Like, why is it so hard to just find someone who thinks I'm worth it? Or should I just watch this mansion eventually crumble in its old age and go to waste without ever having to house a good family that would take great care of it?I tried dating but after seeing many guys whose names I have trouble remembering, I find it pointless and too hard to keep up with. Dates are when strangers put their best foot forward to try to get into someone else's pants. What I want is someone who I can get to know in the real world and grow real feelings for before I decide to share my body with them. Western culture's "three date rule" absolutely disgusts me--I would much rather have an arranged marriage with someone my parents vouch is good for me, than have sex with a strange man I've only had three dinners with. So most of the time I just stop calling after the first or second date.The men I've developed serious relationships with had never been men I met through "dates", and always been someone I knew in the context of a community--college, church, or work. Unless I have the opportunity to observe the man candidly in this context, I can't know him well enough to decide whether he's worth committing to. And since I've both developed a super-independent personality and a history of traumatic relationship, I've tended to develop what I'd call "damsel in distress syndrome" as a precondition for falling in love. I only fall in love with some men who stand by me in a crisis, because this suggests to me that I'll be able to rely on him to stay with me and face rough patches together in the future ... and I've find it hard to change this precondition even after having been proven wrong. And that sucks because I can't wish for or deliberately create a crisis, because that's against my principles and doing so would make me a desperate idiot undeserving of the man that falls for it... nor should a man put me in a crisis for the sake of saving me as my "knight in shining armour" because that would make him a deceitful asshole undeserving of me.Because of this, I've decided to give up on dating. As I've said in the beginning, the life I live right now is awesome enough, and I don't want my childlessness and lovelessness to sabotage my happiness. That said, the heart wants what it wants, and I have a marriage-shaped hole in my heart that nothing else can fill. The best I can do is to make peace with that void and live with it. It doesn't mean I don't cry myself to sleep some nights, or stare at my naked body in the mirror with regret, thinking what if I grow old without ever making love again, or having the chance to bear children. And admittedly on some days I wonder whether there is a point of continuing what I do if I don't get to have a loving husband to grow old with and children to pass on my legacy. I remember traveling to one of the most beautiful places in the world last year and staring out the bus window just sobbing, thinking what if this awesome single life I'm living means doing without something else I also want so much?That said, I still have a few more prime years to go, and till those years are gone, I'll keep a small flicker of hope in my heart... not so big that I'm set for disappointment, but just enough to grasp the opportunity should a miracle happen. I'll keep preparing mentally and financially for the prospect of a future marriage and kids, but not actively look for it. I'd rather focus my energy on the life I do have, maximising and being grateful for it.If I don't get partnered by 36, then I'd consider Single Motherhood by Choice (SMC) as a compromise. But I can't tell my friends and family because many would think I'm dishonouring myself. Sperm donors and adoption isn't legally available for unmarried persons in my country, so probably I'll have to get knocked up over a fling, or wreck a friendship or a job or someone else's marriage... and I'm done crying with disappointment over myself for the thought of doing these things... but I have my heart set that whatever I have to do to make my child(ren) happen will be worth it. In a semi-ideal world, the father would be a good man who then decides he loves me and wants to raise this child with me as my husband until we both grow old. But even if he  pisses off and I never see him again, I'd at least have a child who I'd hopefully be able to single-handedly love unconditionally, provide for, and raise into a good person who loves life. And I'm sure that somehow I'll have a community that loves this child almost as much as I do, who will have my back in my efforts to provide a safe, loving, responsible and honourable environment for this child to grow up in.And if that fails as well by the time I'm 40, then I'll get my PhD in Peace Studies or something related that I care about with my life, and get myself posted in a particular war zone where my set of political beliefs is likely to get me killed. (No, that doesn't count as suicide.) Best case scenario, I'd somehow make it there safely, volunteer locally in a youth programme, mentor some kids/adolescents who come to look up to me as a mother figure, and will keep coming back to me when they're grown and I'm old. Worst case scenario, I die young fighting for something honourable, people who respect my work mourn my death and honour my memory even if from a distance, and nobody has to worry about me growing old alone.So yeah... that's my personal experience of being unmarried and living alone. Thank you for asking this question and providing me with the opportunity to talk about something I can't talk about most of the time.

A therapist told me this story/old joke recently:A man proposed to a woman. She said no.“He spent the rest of his days doing what he wanted, when he wanted, dressed as he wished, watched the movies he liked, shaved when he wanted, and lived on his own schedule, and lived happily ever after.”Half of US marriages end in divorce. Why might this be????

If you don’t want to marry than it’s very good to be unmarried, don’t go for it just for the sake of our so called “society”.WHY?It’s your life, live it in your own way, if you don’t see any person as your life partner then don’t marry. It’s okay, no problem. Don’t think about the society that what they think, what they said and all. There are so many rules made by society for us, but please don’t follow them blindly. If something seems to be wrong than please don’t follow it. I am not asking you to bring change in whole society, but at least start to take a step for yourself when you know you are right. This step will start a new journey of yours, completely yours.I know people are always ready to show you direction whether they are clear or not about this. They expect you to follow it, reason: at some stage of their life they followed the same so they want you to do the same. Just because it’s our custom we have to follow that right? This is society. And if you started following them then you will have to follow them throughout your life, at each stage of your life. And after some year you are one of them and you will do the same as they did. YES, this is going to happen if you don’t take step for yourself. At the end you just have regret left with you, or else it will become your nature to compromise, and you will start to believe that this is life. And if you want to see the examples, see around yourself, there are many to save you by revealing there life to you.Now consider the second scenario,Here people force you to marry because this is their so called custom. But you are clear about it, so you don’t marry. Here the change comes, now in the starting people will keep talking about you some bla..bla. But you are busy in making your life, you are clear about what you want to do in your life and what you want from life. You are continuously making efforts for that. You are busy in exploring your new world with your rules in your own ways. You make your decision on your own. You get everything of your will not on the society’s terms. And when you are successful, this society praises you, at that time they want to be with you in your way with your rules. People start respecting you, because you learnt how to respect yourself and your decision.So decision is all yours what you want.“Give a chance to yourself to live what you want to live not what others want you to live.” Then see the life how beautiful it is….Start your DREAM LIFE with one single step.

To be able to clarify your query basically you are supposed to overcome basic instincts such as lust that is the toughest one to overcome initially.Secondly you are compelled to exercise Chastity as well as asetic Life . Coitus is one basic instinct and one of the biological needs where human beings can not control for sure.You can not live without food water sleep and ​what not​ ? Marriage is an institution where people from two opposite sexes join together as one flesh.Can live without marriage it depends on how you react towards the issue.. Take your own time and make up your mind for sure.In the topical scenario owing to influences controlling ones mind against physical intimacy is just impossible.Hope differed maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh it is a tree of Life.
Who knows for sure if you will not regret staying unmarried in your old age?Can u say for sure that you will never regret staying unmarried all your life? Even when you are 50 plus years age?No marriage in India, means no family or no children of your own. Are you sure you will grow old without regretting not having a family?Marriage means companionship. Forget whether the society allows you or not, will you be happy all your life living alone?
Im 23(M) and my mom is hell-bent on marrying me off. Im not mentaly prepare for such responsibility. Study, career, job, No matter what reason I throw at her she won't listen.My relatives think my marriage is their responsibility (but only socially, not financially).If someone is more eager for my marriage than my mom it's my neighbor who thinks I'm so into his daughter.SO, YEAH… ITS NOT EASY BEING UNMARRIED FOR WHOLE LIFE IN INDIA.

Now a days it's OK we can't say it's OK, but you want to become celibacy, society will criticise and allegation on you, they think you something lagging in your body or may be you are can't responsible person means there is no difference bw you and street dog, in India people's are think as like that, you can't tolerate this then immigrate to another country may be they will accept I hope so.
It totally depends on you.But if you really don’t want to get married I think that is fine. My Uncle did not marry and he is living happily till now.I asked him once “Don’t you regret not getting married watching other families and having kids”.He smiled and said “I never once in my life had regretted my decision. It was completely my decision.I help lots of people and children .And I become a part of their family.If I had married I would have just been a part of only one family”.Just do what you feel .If you don’t want then don’t get married
Dear friend,Getting married or not is completely your own decision. Do not think what others will say. Also, according to Indian society it is good to get married rather than being unmarried for life but yes there still exist people who are happy socially accepted and unmarried.
From a mental health point of view, its better to get married !Man is a social animal, he needs company. And marriage expands or creates social circle for lonely people. The pros > cons 1000% sure. In case you end up with a bad partner and cons > pros then you can go find a different partner. Loving solitude too much is not good sign.

How will you feel when you are old and remain unmarried (but, not single)?
How will you feel when you are old and unmarried (but, not single)?
I personally believe that depending on what you think or believe it could be good for you, if you long or crave for a partner your whole life its going to be rough. If you are instead developing your true self, and finding out who you are for your whole life then you probably won't feel as bad as you think you would. Because you were discovering the world and yourself rather than searching for the answer to other peoples questions.I think of the hedgehog's dilemma where Schopenhauer talked about how when hedgehog's got too close in the winter when looking for warmth, they'd prick each other and then back far away. He believed you had to keep a certain distance away from society, to not get pricked, and to not prick anyone.

Don’t know why you are curious about the life of an unmarried person as you would have been unmarried at some point of time, but if you are curious as to how your’s differs from others here it goes and please don’t think that I am some sad person writing it, its just one phase of my bachelor life that I am describing.I am an Indian and can tell you how it went for me. As mostly it happens in India I was asked to be engrossed in my studies from the earliest years in my life. I was a bright lad and that just brought about more pressure and I thrived to fulfill them. Worked hard, killed JEE got into an IIT, was happy and all but then it boiled downed to “Now What?”. As I finally got out of my small world of books I realized how much I had missed. I had become an introvert, I didn’t know how to make friends, was shy to talk to new people, leave alone girls. So as you see this part of my unmarried life was dull atleast on a social basis.But then comes the change of phase.I slowly started to gain confidence, started understanding social expressions and made a lot of friends. Though I did screw up my acads but I never regretted it. I saw my friends fell in love and have breakups but never bothered as I had actually never had a lot of contact with girls and never thought about it. Life kept going by. Cheap alcohol and cigarettes took a place in life. Parties and late night dance were a common event for me. All in all being that I was having the time of my life- free, unbound, no stress and happy to have no relationships and responsibilities. Despite bad acads got a great job in campus placements. Life was on a whole new level of chill and I was enjoying it to the fullest.But phase change 2, entry of a new character.An old schoolmate of mine suddenly messaged me one day. Hadn’t had a chance to interact with her much during schooldays and thus was more or less blank about her. we started talking daily over messages and calls. I started growing affinity for her and it was clear that she too did. It was a whole unknown territory for me, never had I ever before stepped in it and more so felt intrigued and engrossed, I thought I had fallen for her but didn’t have the courage to tell her. Finally after a few months went to meet her, we had a great talk and started meeting daily. She showed clearly that she liked me and wanted to move forward, but again my confidence shook and I didn’t propose. She must have thought that I didn’t like her and slowly she started to slowly give up, but by the time I realized that I had missed the chances it was too late. she seemed to have lost interest. I tried to talk to her but she had clearly lost the spark. Obviously I can’t blame her, she did what she could and I was in the fault. I still love her and if given a chance to go back and relive that time, I would hold her hand and tell her I loved her with all my heart.Well my unmarried life had a decent tune to it and please don’t think that I live the life of a drunk lover, I am very happy and lively person, I am enjoying my life and am free as a bird. I have accepted reality.So if you are unmarried then I am sure you will have a great life ahead and if you are married then why to think of such things, cherish what you have acquired.

Mine is a completely different answer, but it's truthful am 69 and have never been married, not really even close to it. As a girl, I never dreamed of romance and weddings. I mostly had comfortable friendships with boys and young men and did little dating. Even my younger sister didn't marry until she was 30. My parents had a wonderful, loving 60-year union so I guess they set the bar pretty high for the four of us children.                                                                      In my early 20s, from university, I went with one man for several years and we lived together for some months of that time. I was mostly trying to discover what this "love business" was all about and if it was for me. The relationship never felt solid enough to me to base my life on, so when he drunkenly proposed to me one night, I told him we would talk about it in the morning. The subject never came up again. I decided, after 7 (mostly) unhappy years to move on with my life. I also vowed to find out if men and women could really learn to trust one another and build genuine intimacy on that. Since that time, I've had many wonderful friendships with men, without manipulative games or tension. I can honestly say I've never spent time and effort to find a life mate.In my 30s I met and joined a spiritual group that practiced celibacy before marriage. Although I was matched with a man in the group, he left before I really got to know him at all. Once again, I moved on in my life. Instead of waiting around for happiness to come to me, I went for adventure. Fortunately, I had an opportunity to move to Moscow, just as the Soviet Union was collapsing and I went for it. Now, for the last 22 years, I've been an expat teaching English in Russia surrounded by friends and students of several generations. It's been interesting, challenging and rewarding. I can honestly say I didn't miss a private social life at all.That said, I would say that I'm finally "ready" for marriage and want to make that the next adventure in my life when I move back to the U.S.early next year. I feel I've had so many rich life experiences and now would love to have someone to share them with. I've always been somewhat domestic, but I'm eager now to build a nest to grow old in with a husband. I understand that I/we may only have 5-15 years to enjoy the fruits of married life, with health and lifespan issues looming at the age of 70. But, then again, a lot of the stressors (career and children) of younger married couples will not dominate our time and decisions. Looking back, I guess I was fearful of settling down with a small-minded person who might try to hold me back from growing or living my life fully. Now that I've really shown what I can accomplish (in a foreign country, no less), those anxieties are completely melted away. I certainly know who I am and what I have to offer. I've also seen enough of life and worked with thousands of people so I've gained a pretty good understanding of interpersonal interaction and learned to be flexible. I also know it won't be easy going from "me" to "we", but then, nothing really worthwhile is. I'm approaching marriage with a fresh enthusiasm that few people my age do, and I'm not sorry I waited first to really mature. I guess you could call me a REALLY LATE BLOOMER.---It's now the summer of 2015. After returning to the U.S. from Russia in Dec, 2014, I continued to meet eligible men online. I've now met a wonderful man, 12 years my junior, a retired widower, and have moved to his home in Montgomery, Alabama to prepare for our marriage in a few months. - Erin

Why didn't Isaac Newton get married?
I'm in my mid-40s. I don't see it as different from the rest of my earlier life. You go through the same routine each day, one day at a time. I have my projects, which hold intense interest for me. I feel like I have a mission in life, and I've had it since I was a teenager. That is the pursuit with which I struggle. I get joy and some pain out of that. I love learning, and I have sometimes wondered if the reason I haven't gotten married is that I'm more in love with my work than I am with the idea of being married. On the other hand, I certainly wouldn't mind being with a woman who shared a compatible pursuit with mine, and we could share that love of learning. I just haven't found her yet.In my earlier years I dealt with the judgment that some thought I might be gay. Some wondered, looking as I did, and perhaps being who I was, "How is it possible" that I wasn't married, or at least "with someone." I was mystified at the wonder. I never found it that hard to stay single. I’d shrug, and say, "Just being myself." Sasha Cagan some years back came out with this idea of the Quirkyalone. I've thought that sounds quite a bit like me.There were stretches of time where I wondered if there was something wrong with me, especially after I saw a few of my friends get married, and start having children. I wasn't even dating. It all happened around the same time, in my late 20's/early 30's. Their age was similar. The idea started creeping up on me that my chance of getting married and having children (which has seemed like a nice idea) was passing me by. I got sad about being alone sometimes, though it passed. It wasn't until I got into my forties that it dawned on me that my suspicions about myself were all wrong. The reason I haven't gotten married is I haven't met a woman who is available, and who impresses/inspires me. Most of the women I’d consider were already in other relationships/married. So they were "off the market," as far as I was concerned. While I'd be drawn to others, I didn't feel comfortable just being drawn because of their attractiveness. I wanted to get a sense of the real person, and that's where it's ended. I realize quickly that we're going in different directions.There was a point when I reached 40 where I figured if it hadn't happened by then, it was never going to happen, and I needed to just get used to it. I'm not willing to say never, but the idea that it may never happen is a thought that's been with me since my late 20's.Looking back on my conceptions of this, I've also wondered whether I ever wanted a relationship for the right reasons. Maybe it was just a physical need. I've since heard that many men who get married do so because creating a family is their primary goal in life. I've never felt that way. I've desired that, but my primary goal in life--my first love, you could say--has always been something else. I've always suspected, though, that if I met a woman who I wanted to marry that a lot of that would change--at least for a while.I have sometimes thought that I've been fortunate that I haven't gotten married and started a family, because if I had, there is no way financially I would be able to pursue the kind of work (projects) I've been doing. Though, one never knows.

I love it when people ASSUME that getting married earlier in life will always last into old age and as a result that they will always have a companion and not ever feel lonely or unhappy.Nowadays we haveA divorce rate currently hovering at around 55% in this country (USA), a resurgence of "Feminism" and “gender confusion”.A new generation of women (and some retired ones) who are choosing to either never get married or never marry again.A generation of men reaching middle age and walking out on their marriage while sometimes “trading up for a younger model”.A generation of men choosing to remain bachelors for life—fearing a divorce would leave them penniless and without access to kids (if they even choose to have kids) giving rise to the MGTOW (men going their own way) movement.An increase in homosexuality (most don’t marry even when it became legal), Tran-sexuality and everything else in between.A generation of men and women who may want to get married someday but feel stuck due to social anxiety, unable to relate to the opposite sex or even get the courage to ask anyone out.A generation of men who are not making as much money as their fathers/grandfathers did and thus feel that they wouldn’t have much to offer a woman by way of financial security.A generation of old people who are still married into their 60′s, 70′s, 80’s absolutely lonely and miserable in their 30–50+ year marriage.Given all these conditions its shocking that there are still people out their who believe that marrying in the younger years will somehow guarantee everlasting happiness, fulfillment and bond to their spouse well into their old age.For most people life doesn't end their 60′s and certainly doesn’t have to be less fulfilling simply because they are single. There are literally TONS of things people can do in their 60′s thru 90′s to not feel "lonely". Working, volunteering, traveling, attending social clubs, chess club, dancing, card games etc. —the list is quite long and only shortened by the health status of the senior.Not to mention that marriage in old age is not necessarily “bliss” while being single is not necessarily “miserable and lonely”. My grandparents are a perfect example of this—My grandfather abandoned my grandma in her early 60's, then he remarried at 65 and lived with his second wife until his death in his 90's. His second wife was almost never around for him and neither were his kids (especially since he lived far from them). Definitely NOT a happy and fulfilling marriage or life.Grandma, on the other hand, remained single and lead a full active work and social life well into her old age until the last 6 years of her life where she had to slow down and let one of her daughters and a caregiver help her out at home. She ended up much better off than grandpa and died peacefully in her sleep.Three of my aunts who entered their 60s being single, without children, still had active lives until they passed in their late 60s-70's. I have another aunt who is divorced in her 70's and still very active socially. She’s “too busy” to be lonely.My former grandmother in-law lost her husband to illness when she was in her late 50′s. She CHOSE not to remarry (though she dated a few times on and off) and lived a fulfilling and active social life into her 90s- parties, fundraising, working out, swimming, crafts, church pot luck etc. There was always something going on in her house-several times a week. I have no idea where she had the energy to do everything she did, especially since she wasn't the picture of "perfect health".My former step-mother in law who was 62 when she was abandoned by her husband for a "younger model" wants NOTHING to do with re-marrying. She too doesn't have children. Yet she leads a very active social life now in her late 60′s she does jazzercise, is a freelance caregiver and organizer, attends church services and is involved in other community activities. Last I heard she had gotten a roommate/friend, another single senior lady and together they have a blast.My single and former Mother in law is now in her 70's and moving from frigid temp state to sunny warm state and closer to one of her kids. Her other children want nothing to do with taking care of their mother (that happens alot-you cant count on adult kids in your old age) who is getting over an illness. She is still active but realizes she will need help so she is planning on getting a part-time caregiver/housekeeper as she becomes less able to do things around the house. She is still socially active.My point- THERE ARE A LOT of single baby boomers in their late 50′s, 60′s, 70′s and 80's and there will be a lot more. People who never got married, who are divorced or who are widows and widowers.Life does not guarantee you a spouse into your old age, so if you are counting on someone else to make you "happy" or "less lonely" STOP. Start getting used to doing things for yourself and know that life can be amazing even without a spouse.Some people that face depression in their old age do so because they suddenly find themselves alone after decades of counting on someone else to make them happy instead of finding fulfillment in work, activities, classes, spiritual development and socializing with others. So when their spouse dies or leaves them they become emotionally lost-not knowing what to do, where to go or how to find happiness without a spouse by their side.Finally, there’s the question/concerns of health issues in old age. Sometimes that is a valid excuse to hide from the world, often times it is not.Every single one of my family members starting in their 60s had health issues--often serious--heart, diabetes, spinal degeneration/pain, high blood pressure etc. and every single one worked through pain and health problems, managed to remain socially and physically active.The more sedentary you are as you grow older, the bigger the health problems. That is what my 75 year old half blind, half deaf, heart diseased, diabetic mother told me. She doesn't stop and she goes out EVERY DAY to get some sun and also do activities—library, crafts, classes, exercise (walking), shopping etc. doing these things have kept her diabetes and heart condition under control.So stop worrying about tomorrow, whether or not you’ll get married, whether or not you’ll have kids and live your life!
I am 'over forty' and never married and I don't see it ever happening.When I was younger, I longed to find The One. I was engaged several times and in numerous relationships. I lived with a couple of guys early on but  I had a BAAAD break-up when my youngest was about 2 and I swore I would never let another adult into a position of power within our household. As such, my kids have grown up relating  to my companions only as friends of the family with no say in how their lives were conducted. This has been an obstacle in my relationships - my partners have felt like outsiders looking into the magic circle of my family - but I don't regret it. I was lonely for a lot of years, but I have come to believe that much of that was about sex. While we are still fertile, biology lashes us to find a mate and make more babies. Since my hormones have begun to wind down, I find I have no drive to find a companion. I don't miss sleeping with someone. I don't miss arguing with someone. I don't miss having to get used to someone who eats with their mouth open or farts with abandon. I, on the other hand, greatly enjoy the fact that I may eat with my mouth open and fart whenever the muse moves me. I do miss having breakfast in a little open air cafe by the ocean and reading the papers on Sunday morning and having someone to complain to about the government. I do miss, occasionally, when something really good or really bad happens, sharing it with someone really intimate. I have great friends - but let's face it, the events of my life are just news to them. When you are married, the events of your life are also the events of your partner's life. I have said for quite a long time now that I believe my primary relationship is with art. I have a relationship with writing and music that fluctuates in the same way my friends' and relatives' marriages seem to do; sometimes I hate my creativity and feel smothered by it, I want to leave it but I can't, I feel trapped by my gifts, other times, I love it and I can't spend enough time with it, I feel in love with my projects, I feel nurtured by them, I never feel alone when my creative relationship with myself is in good shape. But then, there are long periods of time when I don't 'put in' to the relationship and as a result, I don't get anything out of it; it gets stale and old and I wonder if that's all there is. But then something will happen, some new idea will take hold of me and I fall in love with my own creativity all over again. I should mention that my kids fill the very human need for strong love bonds in my life. I don't think I could enjoy my singledom nearly as much if I didn't have great relationships with them. I expect to grow old and never be married. It suits me.

There is a saying "One can love all women or one woman, but not both".I chose the first, and I made the right choice.Of course you must not make false assumptions.I have never been married, nor unlucky in love.I have lady friends from nearly sixty years ago.I have men friends in their late 70-80's who fall madly in love; one married the girl he was at college with and was a great grandmother when he proposed.One became an expert dancer in his 80s having never danced before in his life, to win the heart of a lady.I have a lady friend in her 70's who spends much time online dating, and scores better than most women half her age.To some extent the term 'Grow old' can mean several things.Do you mean physically old where you are dependent on others for your care.Do you mean mentally old where you no longer participate in social events.Do you mean spiritually old where you have beliefs and a lifestyle out of keeping with younger generations.Of perhaps even fashionably old where you are seen as an anachronism.In regard to being married, then not having been married means that one is not part of the married scene. This is quite different for men an women. When a man gets married, in most cases he drops his social life. He may have a friend or two, but he will rely mainly on his wife to organise events for family and friends. Married men find it very difficult to make new friends, which is why their work is so important to them. Women tend to have friends from family and neighbours so even in old age they can get some support in times of stress.Again, men make less effort to retain contact - even with their own children - as they get older.Old unmarried man will generally keep up with his 'mates' from work or hobbies.An old unmarried man will generally be self-sufficient in being able to look after himself, but may commonly become quite untidy without a lady to either care or scold him into being more presentable.My experience is that men who get married late in life tend to benefit the most.This extends to men who do not get married but take a partner late in life. This is probably because as we get older we realise that people who need each other have a better relationship than those that love each other. And those that care for each other have a better relationship than those that need each other.
52, and I share my home with my Mother, and my sister, my son is grown and moved on, long time ago. I have a garden, a comfortable home, a nice ride, and I am fine. Many yrs ago, I married a young fellow with Ringling Brothers Circus, lasted 2 weeks. I doubt if I ever walk that walk again, I am comfortable, meaning OLD, older hair, body, face.. (BODY).. yeah. (chuckle) It’s OK! it’s OK…. I cant imagine trying to get used to a man in my life now,, the only man that was ever really in my life,, was my Father,, and he has been gone a long long time.. Sometimes it’s sad,, but I don't have to go through the good-byes at the end of a 50 yr marriage, I don’t have to worry about him getting sick, and me having to do things I never had to do before,, (like mow or snow blow) I already do those. No,, it’s ok….. it’s ok.
Before integrating the duo, the musician must rehearse alone.(Quoted from my book:) In fact, for our sages, as we have seen, human love is the touchstone of divine love. Hence, throughout the entire heroic process (and this process may last several lives), the predestined “duo” should coincide if not always, then often. The Two will then come together to play that melody that they rehearsed by themselves. After all, that’s why we come into this world: to rehearse, to put our soul to the test in order to polish it, to clean it of impurities. Just like a musician hones his technique during rehearsals. Practice makes perfect. Reincarnations are as vital for the soul as daily physical contact with his instrument is for the musician. We cannot clean the impurities off our soul all the way up from Heaven, just as a musician cannot perfect his technique just by studying musical theory. Theory is the necessary foundation, but it’s useless if he does not translate that theory into practice. And that takes time and effort. In the case of a musical duo, perfecting their technique is vital, for the musicians’ harmony on stage depends on it. The more refined their individual technique is, the tighter they will sound, and the less dissonant will their performance of that joint melody be, that melody of which each one of them plays half the notes, so to speak. There will come a moment, after many intense rehearsals, when that double melody will sound as if it’s being played by one musician only, which is what this is all about. And well, Blanca, the same is applicable to predestined lovers, whose ultimate objective –unification- also depends on the refinement of their souls: the more refined they are, the more refined and true their love will be. And true love is the creator of unification.
I was asked to marry when I was 16. I was headed to college after high school and didn't want to be a married college student so I declined. I have had boyfriends most of my life, but none has ever wanted to marry me. Mostly because they had been married and had a bad experience I think. I have lived with a few men too. Mostly I don't like not being able to use the word "husband" I call my mate now, (17 years) "my fella" Ick, I hate it, but can't come up with anything better. I do think of him as my mate. I think of him and his son as my family. Secondly I think about the things that people get out of even bad marriages like part of the persons social security and pension. I'll never have that. I hear people say it's overrated but I am sad that I have never been married.Thank you for your interest.
Getting married doesn’t mean happiness, or that you’ll go into your 70’s and beyond with company or people that actually do care about you.Know of so many people who married and divorced, and many more married and secretly feel dead and bored.Having children doesn’t mean that they will care for you either when old and sick. No, it doesn’t. I witnessed the opposite more often.Bottom line-live the life you want and do what you truly find that brings you joy. We’re all alone in the end.

My husband of 9 years just slapped me for the first time today in front of our son. Should I slap him back to show my husband that he will get the boomerang treatment if he hits me again and to show our son that his mother isn't scared of his dad?
I thought long and hard about answering this, but here goes. I am answering as a 58 year old woman who witnessed her father hitting her mother as far back as I can remember.AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER!Those are the relevant words. I have a few other hazy memories of when I was very young. Our dog, Topper. Our cat, Arthur. But over and above all of them, my father hitting my mother. Not just a slap, but knocking her to the floor.You see, my father drank. When he was sober, he was the nicest man alive. Get alcohol into him, and he turned into a monster.This went on for years, until I got to an age where I would try to get between them. Then I got it too! Some weeks I couldn’t go to school because the bruises were so bad. One New Years Eve, when I was 15, they came home from a works party, and he started. For once my mother fought back, and I ran out of the house in my nightgown, looking for help, and was lucky enough to run into a passing police car. By the time I got back to the house with the police, there was blood all up the stairs, my kid brother and sister were awake and terrified, and both my mother and father were carted off to hospital, leaving me to deal both with two very scared little kids and to clean up all the mess.Did it stop after that incident? No, of course not. My father still drank, my mother and I still got battered, until one day a couple of years later.I was 17, had recently started work, and got home that day to find my mother, sister and brother hiding in the garage. All three of them had punch marks. Yes, my father had been drinking again. My mother begged me not to go into the house, but that day, something in me finally snapped. I marched into the house, and my father came at me. He landed a couple of punches, driving me back into the kitchen, until I backed into the cooker. Without even considering it, I grabbed the handle of a pressure cooker, a hefty bit of kit, and swung it at him as hard as I could.He hit the deck. Out cold. Turns out I’d broken his jaw in two places. What a shame!I left him lying on the floor, and went to get my mother, brother and sister. My mother was shocked to see me, and couldn’t believe I’d walked out relatively unscathed, and when I told her what I’d done, she almost ran into the house to see for herself.My father had started to come round, and was moaning that he needed to go to hospital. My mother said she’d take him, and he rather unsteadily got to his feet. He almost flinched when he looked at me, and that was when the last of my fear of him left me. He was a bully, just a drunken bully, and like all bullies he could be stood up to. I took a step towards him and said, quite calmly ‘If you ever hit any of us again, I will kill you in your sleep.’ He clearly believed I meant it, because he never again raised his fists to any of us.Years later, talking about it with my mother, I remarked that he must have believed me. My mother gave a little smile and said ‘Not just him. I believed you!’I guess what I’m saying with this story is, don’t make your son be ME! Don’t make him grow up with memories of his father hitting his mother, don’t put him into the position where he will try to defend you. Once a man starts hitting a woman, it’s a slippery slope. Leave. Or make him leave.EDIT.I am absolutely dumbfounded by all the upvotes, and the wonderful comments. I so very nearly didn’t answer this question at all, but now I am very glad I did. I’m not normally one to post deeply personal stuff, as my Facebook friends would attest, but just now and then something in me has to respond.Times are very different now to when this all took place. The year in which I finally stood up to my father and decided ‘NO MORE’ was 1978. For many women like my mother, there was NO HELP. Families might know that this kind of thing went on, but it wasn’t talked about.I also want to refute any suggestions that my mother was a weak woman. My mother was trapped. My father was ten years older, and had abused the trust of a young, innocent girl, got her pregnant, and was forced to marry her to escape prison. My mother was 15 when I was born, three months before her sixteenth birthday. They were married two days after her birthday. She had NO CHOICE. Again, these were very different times.A year after I finally stood up to my father, my grandmother passed away. She left her house to my mother. Finally, my mother had somewhere to go, and she took that chance like a shot. Although my father had never used his fists again, he had resorted to verbal abuse. Some of the things he would say were truly awful, and in it’s own way verbal abuse can be as bad, if not sometimes worse, than physical abuse. I had been offered a job at the other end of the country, and my mother finally having her own place, and an escape, allowed me to pursue my dream. We all moved on. A couple of years after she left my father, my mother met a wonderful man. They were together until he sadly passed away from cancer three years ago. He was a fantastic husband to my mother, a brilliant stepfather, and a fabulous grandfather to my children. He was truly a gentle man, and a gentleman.I am only 4 ft 10. My father was not a tall man, but the day I stood up to him I wouldn’t have cared if he was 6 ft 10. I wasn’t thinking about anything except ‘This is going to stop’. Seeing my mother, brother and sister cowering in the garage, on a freezing cold day, shivering and too scared to get any warmer clothes was the final straw.For those who have commented that they have lived through very similar events, I am truly sorry. I DO understand your pain, and the scars, both mental and physical, that it leaves behind. I have sometimes wondered how different my life would have been if none of that had happened, but I finally realise that it has shaped the person I am today, and I LIKE the person I am today. Since that day I have never been afraid to stand my ground, to stand up for what I believe to be right, and to speak up for those too afraid to speak for themselves. I am speaking to those of you now who have similar scars. ’You were a child. It was NOT your fault. ‘EDIT 2I am compelled once more to add an edit.Looking at all the upvoters and the people who have commented, one thing has struck me.This has hit to home so many people, regardless of age, sex, nationality and ethnicity. It shows me that decent people are EVERYWHERE, all over the world, of all creeds and colours.Thank you, every one of you.

If this is the first time he’s slapped you he’s thought about it before. Chances are he’s been verbally and emotionally abusing you for years. Maybe a little here, a little there and he’s finally worked up to the slap. It’s downhill from here, it’s escalating. It won’t get better by itself. Demand counseling as a couple and individually for both of you. For him so he can find out what in his mind told him it was okay to hit you, let alone in front of your child. For you because “why would you be willing to stay with a man who would treat you that way?”. Together so you can find out how to communicate without arguing and definitely so it doesn’t become physical.My first marriage, my husband didn’t really slap me. He use to get me up against the wall and have me standing on my toes while he choked me. Once he knocked me to the floor and kicked me in the head in front of his friend (complete humiliation). He shoved me out the door and locked it. We yelled at each other all the time. One time I grabbed a nearby knife in the kitchen I was so angry, I didn’t use it. Another time I was going to throw a glass candle bowl at him and I was so angry it broke in my hand and mildly cut my hand. My now ex did work up to slapping me in front of my son who was 3 years old. What finally made me decide to leave? My 3 year old son, who had NEVER sucked his thumb, started sucking his thumb. That did it. I said “that’s it”.When you bring a child into the world your first priority is to that child. Don’t let them grow up in a toxic household. Either fix it or cut and run. If he won’t get counseling, LEAVE. It means he isn’t taking responsibility and it WILL happen again. They always say it won’t, but it does.Let me add, this isn’t about showing your son you aren’t afraid of your husband. This is about showing your son you respect yourself.Good luck and be safe.
I’ll share a story and I hope you’re smart enough to understand why.Growing up, I knew a boy that was my same age and who lived down the street. We went to the same school and we became friends. I went to his house but he was never allowed in mine. He had a very controlled environment. His mother had black eyes from time to time, she didn’t have a car and didn’t work. He finally told me his father abused them all. He had a younger sister and swore that if he ever hit her he would kill him. It was so sad to me because he was only a child- without choice of his home. We didn’t see ourselves as children, we were completely grown up at the ripe age of 8–12!One day another school friend and I walked to his house and heard him screaming and crying from the street. Neither of us dared to knock on the door. We both cried and ran back to my house. I spoke to my mom about what was happening. And my friend called our teacher and told her.I was no longer allowed to play with him or go into his house. As an adult I understand why my parents made this call but as a child I was so very upset with them. I felt they should help me to help him. They did, but I had no idea.Family and children’s services was called by the school and both my parents and my girl friends parents. An investigation happened. Within 2 weeks, they moved out and I never heard from them again.Until…. I saw on the news one night that a man had hanged himself in a prison shower. He was there for the second time for domestic violence and was probably looking at serving some serious time. My heart nearly stopped in my chest because it had been 20 years since seeing his face but, it was my friends face all the same. And he was pronounced dead by suicide. It made me cry. He, from birth, had such a hard life. I looked at my family at our dinner table that night and I was so very thankful for all that I had. It made me wonder if he would have had a better life if his mother had just left. What if she had packed after that first slap? He was so smart and wanted to be an architect. Would he have gone to college? Would he have known what it was to have a wonderful family like mine?His mom stayed. So, I’ll never know.So in short, NO. You shouldn’t hit back. Hitting is never okay. No one should be able to hit another person and feel ‘accepted’ because of it. You should leave. There is another rule here, “If he does it once he’ll do it again.”I’m not sure what your home life is like, by this I mean, I’m not sure if you are both verbally combative with each other or not. This is certainly a horrible place and atmosphere for your son. It’s toxic. It generally spreads from one generation to the next because parents who hit each other and who verbally and mentally abuse one another usually do it to their children or in front of them. (In this case, your husband slapping you in front of your son.)Go to a parents house or a friends house if possible. Stay there until you can both go and see a counselor. Your son will need someone to speak to as well but, your son’s counselor should not be the same as yours. Make a huge deal out of what your husband did so that your son sees that it was wrong.Please get help. I don’t mean normal battered women’s help. You need help for yourself as well because to even ask a question like this here is disturbing in and of itself and it’s quite telling about you as a person.Unless you’re simply trolling. Which is a 50/50 chance I suppose. If it is (in a way) I’m glad because it means no child has been put in the middle of your mess.

The first question I would ask is: "Why did your husband slap you?". If it was because he can't control his temper, then you have a problem which won't go away. When my children (who are now in their 40s) told me recently they used to discuss whether or not it would be better if Mum and Dad split up, it made me wonder if I had done the right thing by standing up to him. Maybe I SHOULD have left? But I hung in there because I couldn't put my children through the stress of living in a hostel, or a similar insecure existence. One thing I do know - I had no chance of making him do the leaving! (Not at that point anyway). His game was, what is now known as, coercive control - the mind games, the psychological attacks and the undermining of my very being as a person. This was ongoing while the actual physical abuse occurred less frequently but, when it came, involved grabbing me by the throat and shaking me, "Chinese burns" on my wrists, or kneeling on my arm so I couldn't get away. He usually resorted to these attacks when he believed there were no witnesses. I hope I have succeeded in keeping most of these details from my children as I really didn't want them to know the full extent of what was going on. Finally, a year before the actual split, he said: "I'm going to make your life such a misery that you'll leave". There followed a year of psychological warfare which I must have won because he was the one who left in the end! The children, by then, were 16 and almost 18 and, I later discovered, my son had followed him one day because he didn't believe where his father had said he was going, and my daughter had called the police twice! I had the most wonderful support from so many friends during the next 2+ years as he was still trying to exert his "power" - this time through the courts. It didn't work! Fast forward 30 years. He is still consumed by hatred of me because I stood up to him (words always were my weapon of choice) and resentment that his conduct had failed to withstand scrutiny by judges and other officials. Unbelievably, he still tries to manipulate me through the "children". He just can't let it go, and it's not pleasant for them, but it leaves the unanswerable question: did I do the right thing by staying and fighting back, or should I have left in the hope of putting a stop to his nonsense? Good luck in your current quandary. Hopefully my experience may give you a different take on your situation. You decide.

Leave him ASAP. Pack up and go somewhere safe without him knowing. There are shelters in place for abused women and their children.I was that son who had to watch his alcoholic and hot tempered father beat his wife, my mother, for years and years. My extended family knew that he was beating my mother, but did nothing throughout the years. No one stepped in to help me. Not one of her brothers and sisters called the cops or intervened. Not even my teachers when I told them of what was occuring inside my home. I was seeking help and no one was listening.I had to endure years of watching him physically abuse my mother and I had to endure years of his alcoholism and anger. She didn’t have the courage to leave him in the 70s when he started to hit her.I guarantee you that if he slapped you in the face once, he’ll do it again. If you hit him, he hit you even harder. There is a part of me that will never forgive my mother for her lack of courage in leaving him when she had the chance.I had to gather all of my emotional strength to survive those years and still manage to graduate from high school. I barely did.By remaining in this dysfunctional home, you are setting your child up for potential failure. He doesn’t have to endure years of witnessing physical abuse.I come from a well to-do/middle income college educated family. I lived in good neighborhoods with a dysfunctional father and mother.The only thing that kept me grounded were my friends and a few other “angels” who were part of my existence at different points in my life.My father lives in another country due to financial difficulties he experienced in the states. He had a heart attack recently and his health is poor. I wouldn’t have the slightest remorse if he died. I do hope he finally finds peace in spirit. I wouldn’t want him infecting my home with his presence alive or in spirit.My mother passed away from cancer more than a decade ago. She died not realizing the harm she did by perpetuating a vicious circle by staying with a monster.Imagine your child posting this message decades from now. How would you feel?
The first thing you do when a person slaps you is that you say to them if you do that again I will have you up for assault. Tell your husband that what he has done is domestic abuse and you will not stand for that treatment. Also, tell him that should he ever lay a hand on you again you will call the police and have him arrested for assault/domestic abuse. Demand an apology but don’t slap him back. Tell him that only cowards hit women. There are a couple of reasons why I say don’t slap him back. The first reason is that it could lead him into hitting you more and the other reason is that you are lowering yourself to his level. I would also have taken a photo of any marks on my face or body part that he slapped and diarised it. Don’t put it on a shared computer or phone put it on something that can be stored where he can’t find it. This is not about you showing your son that you are not scared but teaching him that it is wrong both ethically and by the law what his dad has done. Your son will hear your words when you use the words assault, domestic violence, arrested, coward and hopefully hear his father apologise. He will see a woman standing up for herself and not accepting what just took place. If he sees, you slap his dad back he could see that as the “norm” man hits women, women hit back. Instead of hearing the consequences for the action, he just witnessed. Also if this escalates your son will be a witness that you never abused his father, which is what his lawyer would love to be able to argue, if it ever came done to it.I am not saying he will do this again, but you need to note this down and I pray that it was just a one-off.The other thing I would do if that ever happened to me is that if he wanted a cuddle or more, I would say, I don’t cuddle or whatever men who hit women.
As someone that went through domestic violence with my former partner (my daughter’s dad) from the time I was 16 (and he was 26) until I was 25, let me say this:Never. Ever. Should. A. Man. Hit. A. Woman. Women shouldn’t hit men either. Nobody should be hitting anybody! And if that happens, it means that the relationship is going down a steep decline, and to prevent the most amount of pain—physically AND emotionally—leave now. Put your pride down and leave now. Don’t hit him back, because then he will feel you’re even and that it’s ok, because you hit him back. It means more if you just accept it and leave, because he will take you much more serious. Abuse never stops, it only worsens and takes new forms. In my opinion, if someone hits you even once, it shows a huge lack of self-control that’s not as insignificant as someone’s shoe addiction—this often times ends up fatally, especially for women.Set a good example to your son by showing him if he acts that way, women won’t put up with it, they’ll leave. The way you are considering approaching it will show your son that it’s ok to hit women, because they’ll just do the same back, and they will eventually make up. Alternatively, it may even show him that it’s ok for women to hit him in the future! It will essentially show him that violence is justifiable.Furthermore, having your son around that kind of violence is likely to create mental illnesses, such as anxiety, depression, and potentially PTSD. I speak as someone that grew up witnessing my mother being violent towards my father, and it didn’t happen frequently, but it happened nevertheless. As a result, I remember being 6 YEARS OLD having immense anxiety and panic attacks. It was very traumatic witnessing it growing up, and it took me SEVERAL years to overcome my childhood trauma. I didn’t know until I was 21 that anxiety and depression was what was occurring, and I can pinpoint it back to the violence I witnessed. Thankfully, most of my anxiety/depression disappeared as I removed myself from toxic circumstances.Staying with him will perpetuate a cycle of violence in future generations of your family, and will lessen the quality of life not only for you, but for your son. I’m so sorry you’re going through this, I hope everything works out for you.
The first time my husband hit me I was sitting in the rocking chair with my first born who was about 5months old. He slapped me so hard, I was knocked out of the chair still holding my son. Over the years he had slapped me, shoved me, picked me up by the throat and banged me against the wall. I never hit him back and both my sons were lucky to not have really seen it when it was happening. It didnt matter to them if I stood up to their father or didnt. They only wanted the fighting to stop. They were afraid of they're dad. He never hit or beat them, but his mouth and words were as scary as if he had hit them.I finally left him and my sons grew up and are good husbands and fathers.I dont think hitting back would do any good as far as showing your kid that your strong or as tough as their father. It's just showing that Dad and Mom are fighting each other.Both my sons told me at different times, that they thought it was wrong for their father to treat me the way he did but were glad it was never anything serious, where one if us would be severely hurt or killed. They didnt like it and knew it wasn't right. But at that time when it did happen, all they were concerned about was for it to stop, so no, I dont think fighting back would have done any good.
Nope. Showing that violence should be answered with violence is not the answer. You can show him that you aren't afraid without resorting to your husband's level.The bigger issue is your husband showing your son that it is okay to hit his spouse; it's not. Ever. Doesn't matter if he slaps you lightly or hard, if he punches, kicks, or shoves. It's just not okay, not ever okay. At times I felt real hate towards my son's mother, but I damn sure never laid a finger on her, because first of all, it's a horrible thing to ever do, secondly it's a humiliating thing to do to someone (slapping, I mean.) And lastly, I was not raised to ever hit, and certainly never hit my partner, and I'll be damned if I will ever let my own son think that is okay.Think about this; your son saw his father, the main male role model in his life, and likely, as with most son's, his hero, hit his wife. What lesson did he learn from his dad? That the best way to deal with an unruly woman is to hit her? You are a person. You are not your husbands property, to be treated and dealt with how he pleases. I wonder if by “for the first time in front of our son” should be read as “he's slapped me before, but always in private.” No one has the right to lay their hands on you like that, and it will probably happen again. Is that really something you want your son to be exposed to? Let me also ask you this… how will you feel when, some day down the line, you learn that your son slaps his own wife/partner? I know that if it were my son, I would be pretty devastated. Just something to consider.

Pros:No sharing moneyNo spending thousands of dollars on a wedding nor divorceDon't have to worry about another person's mess around the houseOnly have to cook for one (ALL FOR YOU)No arguing/dramaNo sharing in general (unless you have a roommate, but still)Cons:No support in paying for thingsNo affection/intercourseCan cause depression and/or lonelinessDifficult to feel loved and cared forPossible jealousy of other relationshipsCan be boring
You are independent. You are the in-charge of your life. You can take decisions for yourself. You can save the money that’s spent over marriages and can continue to save a lot afterwards. Maintenance of marriage has become too expensive now-a-days. These are some pros of staying single, in my opinion.Cons: You may feel lonely in the fag end of your life. Married people will treat you with suspicion in your younger age. They will think you can steal their partners. People may treat you as “not normal” also. You may have difficulty in getting rented accommodation at many places.
These are heritage views.There no pros for women being unmarried, i mean cons out weighs the pros. It is suggested every woman marrys.ConsWomen should be under the protection of father, husband or son.Less securityUncivilized men will disturbMissing the experience of MotherhoodTo have children without being married is trending but not good for children and mother.There are various physical, mental and emotional demand of the body which may be deprivedOne of my mom's aunt determined to be single ( IAS officer) but only to marry at age of 60 age.

What is it like to remain unmarried just because you loved somebody?
By understanding your question I have these two assumptions:1: You want to be single and particularly want to know how it feels to be single from an experienced person!..2: Practically answer might differ for a Boy and a Girl. Its totally different scenarios for both of them.3: Am I eligible to answer your question? Well you can decide it for yourself.Because I have two people in my life both a male and a female who are unmarried. And they are nearing around to their 50s. Let's take an example of these two people’s life and experiences.The first story is about My Aunty(Female) who remains unmarried till now.I was always very curious about her life. One day she did reveal why she wanted to remain unmarried when we both were traveling from Chennai to Bangalore in Lalbhag express :D.The first reason was she loved someone very deep(for 8years) but couldn't marry him by that time she was inbetween of 23 years to 24years old.Then she decided to remain *single*.There after she kept herself busy settling her career, responsibilities bla bla.. Succefully she remained single until 29. It was then she realised Many of her friends got busy with their own life and after a certain age there were no friends at all(The harsh truth). She felt like having insecurities of being single whole life time and for a girl she was more skeptical being single. In the meanwhile pressure started to arise from her people and the society. She decided to have an arranged marrige finally.Many proposals were on her way, but unconsciously She have searched the same person (the one she loved) in everyone and finally couldn't match her expectation with none. literally She started rejecting many proposals on her way by that time she was 34already(Arranged marriage Is a big process trust me)This time she was more matured enough to decide properly.She had already been experienced these days to be single. But since she had an elder sibling Big brother, She also had an loving parents with her. She said she wasn't actually feeling that depressed except That part she was missing him. Maybe at times she felt hard being single, but most of the time she was happy.. She loves travelling to ancient temple in india even now, It is her passion she always travelled and had fun with her family, friends, etc.On a bad morning her mother left this world unexpectedly. She started to feel the darker phase of the life. Gradually as there was no option she had to over come the Second Depression this time unimaginable, She and her father remained at the same house it took her a while to heal. Her brother was married to a beautiful girl, They both decided to live separately. She started missing her brothers comfort too. Her father is an awesome guy extremely loving, supportive ,generous ,good hearted person is what she always describes! Her father is 91years old he still remains with her, She takes care of him. She is a very funny, A great teacher. She has a beautiful voice She sings Carnatic songs amusingly. She cooks exquisitely! She teaches Bhagavad Gita to kids sometimes songs. For her livelihood her brother supported a lot from the beginning. But she wanted to be a self dependent women. She worked as an accountant in a small company for several years. After volunteer retirement now she does catering free lance job. She works in Ghoshalas and in some NGos.By the way she describes her life I can feel a lot of pain inside her. Even thou she seems happy. As a women being single in this era is really not an easy task. She had faced unlimited insults, felt very insecure travelling alone. It was really very challenging for her. To imagine how she could have maintained those creepy narrow minded society 10 - 20years ago.Now she is 50years old. She had crossed many ups and downs in her life. Yet she is very happy, She has lot of time for herself.She says when she 25 she realised there were no friends at all and there was no technology! like we have now, No android phones no internet. All her friends got married and we're busy. She had to face comparisons! Etcs.But now the story is totally different! She has many aunties in her team in her age.. They keep travelling singing songs, She helps poor kids as much as possible. It did turn out good! I would say.As a final thought I asked her whether I can stay single and stay happy?Her answer was very simple. She said you will have more regrets. Because most of the time we won't have our parents by our side after 50s. She said she was lucky enough to have her father by her side. But its not the same for all. That doesn't mean you cant frame your life happy. It is up to us to define what happiness means. Each one of us has a different meaning to this word “Happiness”. But she added keep in mind! World is not easy on us when we are single.! Personally from her experience she doesn't recommend anyone to be single. Just because of love failure especially. At the same time she says, It's up you to decide if you aren't a love failure. Since it's totally your will and desire to remain single. Because each one of us has a different definition for this word “Happiness”.! Isn't it?(It's completely a personal opinion based on her life) Not the best or the right answer for the above question! The right answer is left to us..**************************************************

First of all before taking any decision a wOmen needs to know the actual meaning of marriage..most of d meaning of being a "WOMEN"..!!Marriage is another name of devotion and acceptance..!!It takes lot of courage and guts to holding over on to..it's not as simple as it seems..!!Here vr focusing more over on wOmens because,if we chuck d social and influenced perspective about women's it has been proven that females are far more stronger thn any other gender nd thus considered as extremist !!Research graph has shown tht in imotions,revenge,mental stability,prompt approach,decision making..etc females are more thn 30% active thn any other gender !Hence it is proved that why do I believe that every action,reaction nd relation is based upon women's activity behaviour nd herOwnself..!!After knowing this all facts it's her moral responsibility to take charge of every relation whether it's sister,daughter or even friend  nd utilise her born capabilities..It's her "Dayitva" of taking care of each nd every one she's surrounded off nd understands her responsibilities..!!A women meant and born to b independent..Dont go for d marriage just for d sack of cheap dependency.....!!and if you come over as successful Individual,daughter,sister and friend..only then you should think of getting marry..Because it's d matter of two families and many generations..!!Don't ever ruin this heavenly and holy relation just for few mean motives..!!Go for d one who respects your individuality and your existence..For whom u gonna give ur everything maintain d actual feel of ths relation..!!And if you can't find/maintain....don't go for it....life is yours..live it for full..:) thr are so many things to do:):):):)Think wisely..!!

Life of an unmarried woman?
The biggest most widely sought after advantage is probably the ability to raise children in a family. Having said that, there are thousands of children here in the US waiting to be adopted (and yes singles can adopt, you just have to ask). The dream is having hubby support you and the growing kids while you begin a career, then interrupt to raise family, then when you get good and ready go back to work, and wonder why your salery is not as high as the people around you who didn't get a chance to take time off.No one can decide that one but you. for that matter, you can select a nice guy and ask him to be the biological father. Although he might think you are just after child support. (I am not sure it is legal to write a contract that says that the man who is the bio father is not on the hook for child support. If that is the case no dad is going to want to sire the pups, and then pay child support, without being a functioning father in the family.In most other respects, being single, with or w/o children, wouldn't be much different that a man in the same condition.Are there other issues that you are thinking are potential pros or cons?
Life of an unmarried woman?
Definitely do what you want. Even if it is still viewed as a bad thing, please do what you want. I'm not sure about this either. But, please consider the following. You're saying you'll date and therefore you won't be lonely. Please don't mistake having random company for not being lonely. You might be perfectly happy, but lots of people feel very lonely even wíth a relationship..let alone if you don't have someone 'to come home to'. You might find comfort in friendships, but: they might get partners of their own and even children, and therefore have less time for the friendship. Another thing: if you date, and even if you don't date...you could fall in love, you know. Just as much as people can't 'decide' that they'll be married, because they can't be sure to find someone that will make that happen, you can't be sure someone won't sweep you off your feet and maybe even change your mind about marriage. And also: a relationship isn't the same as marriage...i'm not sure which you mean exactly. Either way, keep all this in mind.
Life of an unmarried woman?
Honestly, being unmarried isn't bad at all. You have total freedom with out worrying about someone else. If you reside here in the USA, marriage isn't what it used too be. It's no longer encouraged to remain married rather the courts are now teaching "how to get a peaceful divorce". However, if you wish to have children. It would be a good idea to have a partner to help your raise them. Just something to think about. And, NO it is not considered to be a negative if a woman chooses not to be married. If you do not have the desire to marry then dont. Why put yourself through the headache if its not what you desire. Forget about what others think. Its your life. No one is living it except you. So do what makes you happy...period!

As a single working mother in the U.S., I've done well -- my son is now an adult. The choice is yours to live as you want to live. I would, however, counsel you to be open just in case you meet someone that fits with you.  I also had several "spinster" aunts who lived fulfilled lives until their 80s. They never married, one stayed home to take care of aging parents and one was a high powered finance executive. They were very close sisters. The role models are out their for whatever lifestyle you choose. The choice is yours.
Fabulous! I do what I want, when I want, which whom I want. I have a great job, a master's degree and do lots of volunteer work. I have a dog that is the woof of my life and my soul mutt. (If I had had her first I wouldn't have had to bother with the marriage and divorce). I play with my 14 nieces and nephews and 16 great nieces and nephews and when they are hungry, angry, tired and messy I give them back to their parents! I take a 2 week trip to Europe annually. I never have to put on pants, shop, cook or clean the house. LOTS more women should consider staying single.
In addition to culture and tradition, marriage is a security licence for women. Under the present living conditions, unmarried women have to face more dificulties than married women. Every country have to develop and provide separate security system for women, till that is achieved, woman living alone is not safe.

Consider this story.Let say a boy of age 25 decided no to marry. He has family (mother, father, sister, brother & relatives). He has got good friends also. He is just 25 and have a job and earning well. He is enjoying every bit of his life. Does he need anyone in his life to make him happy. No, of course not. He goes office, he works and had lot of fun there. He came back home in evening and spend time with family and siblings. Its all fun being in he family.Weekends he hangout with crazy friends. Movies, parties, events, shopping, trip and what not... I told you- “He is enjoying every bit of his life”5 yrs laterHe is 30- most of the friends are either married or committed to any girl or relocated to other city due to Job. Weekend hangout is not as much as it used to be. He got few more friends in office but they are just friends. Sister already got married and living a happy life with husband, he talk with her sister over phone and sometimes visit her house. His brother also got married and got a small cute kid. Father and mother are older now, their health is a concern now.10 yrs laterHe is 35. All of his friends are married. They have got kid and family to look after, so no more weekend fun or trip with friends. They are not as much in contact as they used to be previously. He feel little lonely as friends are busy, people around him in office are either young or married. He can’t stare at girls, as he feel little older. Her sister and brother has got kid and family too to look after. They are little busy in their life. His father is no more. Mother is lying on bed always due to health issue. She needs constant help and care, He sits by her side and try to help her find some happiness.15 yrs laterHe is 40 now. He looks like a middle aged man (a 25 yrs old boy call him uncle). He has no more interest in working as he has nothing to fulfill (He wanted to see the world but going alone make him sad). He is hardly in contact with friends. Sometimes talk to sister. Brother is busy in taking care of his family as he got two kids and wife. Both kids going to school. People in society and relatives do bitching about him being a single. Mother is no more now. She passed away a year before. He miss her mother. He is a lonely guy now. He sleeps alone in loneliness.20 yrs laterHe is 45 now. He has already quit his JOB and gave most of his savings to his brother for his kids. Half of his head hairs are either gone or turned white. He looks little older. There is very less talk between brothers (No personal issue, it is just that they don’t have mush to share). He rarely talk to her sister or meet her. He walk alone on road, sleep alone and eat alone. He is part of his brother’s family but feels alone most of the time.25 yrs laterHe is 50 now. His nephew and niece are young and energetic now. They are busy in their friends, party & college. He remembers his young days seeing them.He reads few books on life and spirituality to pass the time. He uses power glass to read as his eye sight is week now. He rarely meet anyone. He has no hopes or any desire from life. Every day of his life is passing just like another day.30 yrs laterHe is 55 now. He often fell sick. When he fell sick, he want someone to be his side and hold his hand. His nephew and niece are married now. Both living in different city due to job and family. He miss them.40 yrs laterA big photo frame is hanging on the wall.

Do introvert men live a better life by staying unmarried?
Which is better? Getting married or staying single?
If you ask this question to any married person , his / her reply would be “ don't marry, be happy “ .It's your personal decision, whether you wanna marry or be single for life.Speaking in spiritual terms ,, less attachments - less karma and vice versa.When a man marries , he will have the added responsibility of a husband , and eventually a father , and has to fulfill this duties upto his last breath !!On the contrary , if he is single , then he would not have this duties of husband and father , thus will have less attachments…The more attachments , the more karma ,, and thus you will never have time for introspection of yourself (knowing who you are) and you will be always in this illusionary world (maaya ).Good luck ☺
There is nothing good or bad exist in the world,its all about individual's perception towards that.To marry or to be single is only and only your choice.If you want to marry then you should have your desicion,your own understanding of pros and cons of marriage & it's associated responsibility & restriction.Same thing applied to be single also.Its not easy thing to sustain single if you don't have any plan to tackle loneliness and sickness of partner.You have to be very busy with your choices and likes so you do not feel miss or sick of anybody particularly for physical need as it's most desired & uncontrolled things in life.So give lots of thought then decide best for you.Never decide anything under any influence or under anybody's advise or experience.
Words from JOHN DUMELODon't marry for sex,don't marry because you are of age.don't marry because you are getting old,don't marry because you are lonely,don't marrybecause you need someone to support youfinancially,don't marry because you mistakenly got pregnant.don't marry because you don't want tolose the person,don't marry because of familypressures,don't marry because you like the idea of marriage and admire every wedding gown you see.don't marry because all your friends are gettingmarried.But get married because you are in love, get married cos he or she is your best friend and when that love is no more , he or she can still make you smile.-John DumeloRest everyone is capable of deciding self\U0001f62c\U0001f62cThank you

Is it good to for a man to stay single, and live a “pure unmarried” life?
Sometimes we feel dat it's good to live unmarried becoz it's related to many responsibilities and also becoz we need freedom.But as life is like a bicycle and we have to balance it well, so it's good to get married and take new responsibilities for the future. In everyone’s life dat phase comes where we need a soulmate so it's good to get married with the right person.
No,I think it's not a good idea to stay unmarried for whole life. Eventually time will come when we ll b no longer strong mentally as well as physically. At dat tym,we want someone to hold our hand and stand by our side. No one can do dat better than a life partner.

I am a guy and not a fan of  getting married. It is hard to convince your parents  bcoz they think it is next to impossible to stay unmarried. For you I would say first become financially independent and than move to other city. Else, if you stay with your parents stay unmarried then sooner or later there will be a lot of problems and pressure.

My 35 years of unmarried life has been good with the usual ups and downs.My life choices should work for me. People, ofcourse will have their opinions but this is my life. I am currently in a relationship but I have been single a lot in my life. Being single has been very important for me in developing myself, interests, friendships, career and opinions. I think its necessary to become comfortable with who you are before you can truly be with somebody for marriage or otherwise.I don’t worry if guests/staff in restaurants look at me as the only solo diner (Table for just one???!!!)I don’t worry if I am the only single person in a movie theatre.I don’t worry (but I do get annoyed) when my colleague’s (with a wife and children) long weekend request gets prioritized over mine.The importance of marriage in our society today is dwindling. There is no guarantee for lifelong companionship just because you are married. Fear of being alone is not a good enough reason for me.If you choose to stay unmarried that is a perfectly valid choice just like how getting married is another valid choice.

For a person to mature spiritually and emotionally he/she needs to get married.One thinks one can be free of all problems if one remains unmarried. But that is not the case. A person who is unmarried will get ill will need hospitalisation etc. Hence family is essential.Having a life partner and kids do try your tolerance level. It teaches you to be compassionate, tolerant and selfless. It makes you think of others before you think of yourself.This helps you grow mentally emotionally and spiritually.I thought I did not need to marry as I was happy on my own. I got seriously ill and could not get up to make a cup of tea for myself or leave aside get a glass of water for myself. After a few days I got stuck in a traffic jam and walked a long distance,changed buses and reached home around 10.30 pm. That day I realised that any car could hit me and I could die. The MCD would cremate me as an unknown person as my identity papers would get stolen along with my money. No one was there who would come looking for me.These two incidents changed my mind. I realised that I was being selfish, by not trying to fulfil my purpose in life. This was 1996 March/April. Once you start think in a particular way, the universe moves to fulfil your wish. I met my would be husband in August 1996 and we were married in February 1997.

If we look at behaviors of people all across the world, we will find that ex-communication and solitary confinement are almost a universal way of punishing another person. It is considered one of the most painful punishments ever, without even physically touching the person! Sad and amazing all at once! I think this shows that no matter how much humans like to profess their independence, we are inherently social beings, and actually suffer greatly when deprived of human contact. Even those people I know who live alone and say they never want to get married/remarry etc. always have a pet, or they try to fill their life with a sort of ersatz human interaction in the form of watching a lot of TV, multiplayer games, joining forums, etc. The sad thing I've noticed is that these people start to isolate themselves, so their social skills decline, then when they meet people, they alienate them, and when they feel that,  they become disheartened and isolate themselves more. It can turn into a bad cycle. One does not have to be a blind sheep just to have friends, but I think it is always good to be affiliated with a "tribe" that can look out for you, protect you, and be there to celebrate the joys of your life. If you have this with your group of friends/relatives, I suppose that is fine. However, in the United States, at least, friendship is quite different than in other countries--people rarely hang out with their friends everyday, they can't just walk to the corner to meet their buddies---so I think having a partner takes on even more importance here. Unfortunately, our chances of finding a partner are not equal at all ages--so it is better to start young, when you have a maximum choice of mates, and also, you can build more memories with that one lucky person. :)
I have been alone for most of my adult life. Most of the time that I wasn't alone I was with someone who made me feel like I was alone. Being in a relationship with a person who really cared about me was better than either. And being with a person who made me feel alone was the worst of the three. No relationship stays in the initial adoration phase. But as long as you find one that can continue to be healthy and mutually fulfilling I would say go for it. I've always liked being alone, but as I've gotten older, it's gotten worse. Right now I don't enjoy being alone. I wish I had someone to just spend time with. I want to have someone who is there for me when I need someone to talk to or even to sit quietly with. I want to know that if something were to happen to me, there would be someone that would care for me. I want to know that if I can't do something on my own there is someone who will help me with it. I want to have someone who will tell me that something I am doing doesn't make any sense. I want someone there who enjoys my company and wants me around. I want to have intimate sex with someone who I care about to fill an emotional need, not just sex with someone I hardly know just to fill a physical need.I want to share my life with someone in every way. I want a partner in crime even if that crime is just downloading copyrighted material. I want someone who appreciates the things I do for them as much as I appreciate the things she does for me. I want someone to inspire me to do more for myself I want a reason to wake up in the morning.I want a reason to go to bed at night.I want to be desired and to desire someone else.
Well i can certainly blame the women of today for this since they’re so very picky today when it comes to having a relationship since most of the time the women out there these days want men with a lot of money since they like getting very expensive gifts from these men as well. Many women nowadays are real Golddiggers since it is all about money for them since they will never at all go with many of us good men that don’t make a lot of money but enough to get by which it is good enough for us. Most of the women now are nothing at all like the real good old fashioned women were which most of the women back then were the very best of all and they really did put these women today to real shame as well. The women in those days didn’t really have any money at all since both the men and women at that time were struggling just to make ends meat and they really Accepted one another for who they were which today i will admit that women today have choices. But this is the real reason why many of us good single men are still Not married today since it is the women nowadays that are very high maintenance, independent, selfish, spoiled, greedy, picky, narcissists, and very money hungry that have caused many of us men to be single since we really Can’t blame ourselves at all either. If i had a choice which i definitely would’ve been married with my own good wife and family today which i am very sure that many other men will agree with me as well since it does Take Two To Tango Today.

I have also been single for most of my adult life. Ironically, the only person that has been encouraging me to find someone to date is my ex-boyfriend. I'm not sure why, since he has been adamant about not wanting to be in a long term relationship ever, and has stated that as the main reason why he broke up with me. I have the feeling that you are a very young person. Probably in your early 20s. The best advice I can give you, is to respect your own feelings. If you feel content in your life as it is, then that's a very good sign. It means you're not looking for contentment outside of yourself. You're not relying on anything or anyone to make you happy, and that's a good thing, because happiness comes from within yourself, and not from anyone else.There's an old fashioned idea that dating or marrying someone will somehow complete you as a person.  This myth is perpetuated by older generations as a method to propagate the human race (even though the planet is already overcrowded as it is). If you want proof of people who look for happiness outside of themselves by dating or marrying, and realize their mistake too late, you don't have to go very far.  I'm sure such people exist all around you, and I'm sure they were also pressured into dating/ or marrying and wish they'd had the confidence to find the contentment they wanted within themselves before they involved someone else in their life. It may sound like I'm being negative about relationships, but honestly, I do believe in the value of a positive relationship, as long as you're in the relationship for all the right reasons, none of which include being in that relationship in order to be "happy". Take care of your own happiness and make it a priority, then, if or when you feel it's the right time for you, you may choose to find someone to form an interdependent partnership with. Someone who encourages and inspires you in life and earns your trust and confidence. some of us never find that person and that's OK too. The point is that we don't need to rely on another person to supply our happiness.  A good relationship should add to our life, not complete it.
I certainly don’t and it is scaring me a bit. I donno if my opinion will help you or if I am just annoying people here ( if I a I am sorry) .I am just so happy being alone ( been this way for three years ) and it is scary because I don’t know in what direction society is heading under these circumstances.I live in the UK and around here it seems like all marriages break down, and you need to be really lucky to find someone decent to be with.If you want to be alone forever I say go with it. You can find people to hang out with and to be intimate with without the whole marriage and committed relationship sha-bang. I think it is much more fun to know a lot of people and have all types of different experiences instead of just sticking to that one person, who is likely to leave you anyway. I treat everyone with respect and empathy I don’t treat people unkindly.Stay single! There are plenty of people out there making babies.
I don't know if this is helpful, but I had the same experience with people telling me to go out and start dating. I divorced my ex husband in 1987, and since I had three children to raise on my own, I was too tired to do anything except come home from work, take care of them and fall into bed. That changed when they all grew up and left the house. I was totally unprepared for that. I couldn't believe how quiet my life became. I cried at night after my last child left for about six months, but then something changed within me. I discovered that I liked living alone. I didn't have to negotiate what to eat for dinner, what movies to watch or music to listen to. I could sit in my recliner and fall asleep without being disturbed, go different places without anyone asking "Where did you go?" or "When are you coming home?" And best of all, I have the bathroom all to myself! It was, and still is marvelous. I love my children so much, but I also love having my autonomy and private space. And I'm not lonely. People still bug me about dating, and I was in a relationship for a while. But we broke up. I love my independence more than him, and he sensed that. Sometimes I miss him. But most of the time, I'm grateful that I can live exactly the way I want to live.
One of our life-long friends is now living with a woman. They got together when he was 55 yrs old. She is near his age, they are a great couple and very well matched. This is what he told me. "I wish I hadn't been so afraid to try a relationship. I'm really happy"It doesn't matter if you remain single. It's sad if you refuse to accept love and happiness because of some idea or principle you've held.Many people remain single their complete lives. Very few remain that way, without some other significant relationship in their lives. Maybe it will be with a sibling or parent, or with a community (whether it be religious, or secular), or even just living with a partner.

What is it like to not get married and live alone?
Hi there. I am a 34 year old educated single woman and just recently I am starting to feel the weight and magnitude of having no one. I was never worried because I had a nice career and feel like the right relationship comes when it comes. You can’t force it. I’m also a happy and empathic person and Ive never lacked male attention since I was a teen, but I did start dating late (23) because I was raised very protective.Fast forward 10 years I have three broken relationships and several situationships with guys who wasted my time, lied to, abused, used and betrayed me and I might sound bitter but I heartily wish them the magnitude of all the tears I cried and more deeply. I was innocent and naive and the damage and cost on my person are substantial. I’m still a kind and softhearted person but at this point Im so mad I couldn’t care less and gotten to the point where I resent hearing the words I love you or I care for you because the same arms that held me broke me.Nevertheless I used to pick myself up somehow and am happy with my friends and family and career.The moments I’d feel annoyed were generally the moments in between dating/ relationships that people ( colleagues, landlord) would rudely joke or keep on asking about my relationship status ( seriously, what is wrong with people? ‍♀️) sex life or when I was planning to have babies and act like something was wrong with me. I’ve changed jobs and apartments since then ( life’s too short).Anyway. Now I’m not married and have never felt so unsettled. Why? Because Im so tired of waiting for the right person and want to have a baby so much and am running out of time. Where is he? It’s now dawned on me that women have roughly 15 to 20 years to find the right guy if they want kids and that’s as real as the sun coming up every morning. Its such a harsh and unfortunate reality. It drives me mad and I wake up sobbing in the middle of the night and have frequent nightmares. I’m seriously thinking of lowering my standards ( I don’t like these words because people are who they are and I would never feel myself better than anyone) because I don’t want to be alone anymore. There’s no better feeling than cuddling up to your partner at night and getting a forehead kiss or spooning while watching a movie. I’m currently between jobs and I’ve lost all my motivation. I’m not even applying anymore or thinking about the future ( I’m not yet where I want to be). I feel like I wouldn’t be able to function well at work like this and nobody is ( rightly so) waiting for a depressed colleague anyway.I’ve had options but what to choose between unemployed with zero motivation, uneducated, have no intent of ever wanting to leave their parents home ( mommas boy) and want you to come live in, drug addicts, irresponsible, etc.. Some romantic prospects also didn’t work out because of our careers, life goals etc. Those are people I’m still friends with.Anyway despite everything I’d like to say to everybody there is no perfect way. Marrying early, marrying late, having kids, not having them, it’s all personal. Follow your heart and make the best of what you can. To the shy people I would say you can always turn your life around by following some courses to become more assertive etc.. Also cosmetic surgery is an option. Life is short. Do not deny yourself anything that is within your means to change. I wouldn’t. When I go I’ll go bruised and beaten but in the knowledge that I followed my heart and kicked life back in the butt :) All the best to you all.

I'm 48 and have never married though I have been asked many times (got engaged twice, then called it off because I realised my reasons to accept were suspect).  So far, I haven't met someone I really truly want to spend the rest of my days with. Here are my thoughts and motivations on being unmarried:1. I love my own company. In fact, I need those hours of solitude and without it, I feel out of balance.2. Though I'm single, I have a very active family life with regular interactions with my siblings, their partners, my nephews, nieces, cousins in addition to close friends. And no, I don't have to wait for them to include me in their family activities. Most events that involve my extended family happen at my home. Right now I'm enjoying the quiet and relaxation from after the festive season celebrations that included Christmas luncheon and two barbecues at my house and plenty of visits with family members and friends. I have a large home with plenty of guest rooms for visiting friends, nephews, cousins and siblings and their families. What I'm trying to say is that, being unmarried does not preclude an active family life if that's what suits you. 3. Being unmarried means you don't need to consider anyone else when you want to do something major- like travel. I'm a mobile worker, so I can easily ( and do) travel for work, to get away for some quiet and relaxation or to visit my large family . I've been known to rent a place for a month in cities/towns where my family or friends live and then get on with my life, spending time with them or maybe not socialising at all, whatever suits me.4. Being married and having children is no guarantee that you will not be alone in your old age. Children grow up and move clear across the country for work or because they choose to. They may even move to other countries. Partners divorce or pass away. Lots of old people are alone and lonely even though they married and raised families.5.  Just because I'm unmarried doesn't mean I wouldn't choose to, if the right guy came  along. But as an adult woman who has built a rich life for myself (not necessarily money), I have a great deal to compromise if I marry. That person would have to offer me something extraordinary to tempt me to a commitment. But I'm not unaware that a companion walking with me through this life and showing me new pathways I was unaware of would enrich my life further.6. I have a huge respect for the institution of  marriage. I was born of a couple that was happily married for 0ver 40 years, till death parted them.  My siblings are well-partnered too. So my experience of marriage, albeit a secondary one, has been very good. So I'm not unmarried because I have something against marriage. 7. Old age is what you make of it, and it doesn't have  to be alone and lonely. I live part-time in a village where old people are very active in community affairs and do a myriad of activities to keep busy and active ( play soccer, walk everywhere, meet, help out in wedding preparations... gosh. The elderly are very busy here and integrated into the daily life of the young too). Honestly, old people in this village have a hectic schedule and you'd have more time to yourself if you were young with a fulltime job.

What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?
​February 18, 2016 UPDATE: When I posted my answer below, I had no idea of the positive responses that it would get. I didn't seriously think anyone would read it or comment.  I posted it as a lark.What I didn't know then was that I would be treasuring each of those memories and moments so much these past 4 days, because today I was just diagnosed with Stage 3 Lung Cancer.   I have never smoked, I don't drink, do drugs or even caffeine.  I excercise regularly.  My doctors say I am in excellent health, except for the cancer.  I share this to say to all of you, LIVE THE LIVE YOU LOVE with no regrets as I have.  You never know how quickly it might disappear.  I wish you well on your journeys!Love, AnnetteI've been single all my life and I'm now 62 years old. Yes, I've dated, but I've not ever wanted to marry or have children. It was not what I was put on this earth to do.“The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.” ~ Mark TwainI know why I'm here.It's not like no one's ever asked. I've been asked to get married once in my 20's. Another time, this narcissistic guy (whom I didn't even consider a date) had plans that we were going to get married.  Sheesh! I'll spare you the details.I agree with what a few others have said here. Being voluntarily single is awesome. I've gotten to have the life of my dreams, a successful career, travel and to live where I want to.  One day I started a list of all the fun stuff I've done.  I read it when I think I'm not doing anything with my life.Here it is - remember, I've lived a long time!Concerts I've attendedJames Taylor (3 times, including once with Carol King) Ravi Shankar - famous Indian Sitar player...who taught George Harrison sitar John Mellancamp - twiceJudy Collins Carol King (with James Taylor) Joan Baez Bob Dylan Tony Bennett Neil Diamond Josh GrobanBob Seger - I heard him twice about 40 years apart...he played a concert at my High School football stadium Dizzy Gillespie - jazz trumpet Pablo Casals - classical Spanish guitar Elton John Paul McCartney Phil Keaggy - Christian guitar afficinado Joshua Bell - violinist Bruce Molsky - fiddler Janis Ian Livingston Taylor - James Taylor’s brother Muddy Waters - blues Leo Kotke - guitaristJimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer BandPeter Mayer GroupChicagoThe Doobie Brothers Reba McIntyreGeorge Winter - New Age pianistPete Seeger - folk singerLeon RussellBeauSoleil - Cajun bandPeter, Paul and MaryCrosby, Stills and Nash-twiceRachel Barton-Pine - violinistThe Chenelle Sister - a fun, retro girl group from Ann Arbor who do Big Band era songsRicky Skaggs - CountryJohn Hartford - CountryMichael Martin Murphey - CountryHoyt Axton - CountryEdwin McCain - one hit wonderBlue Man GroupCirque de Soleil - "Love"Natalie McMaster - Cape Breton fiddler - twiceThe Who - this summer!I still want to see Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana and Sting in concert.Speakers/Authors in personJane PauleyTimothy Leary - the LSD guruJane GoodallJon Kabat Zinn -trained with him in Mindfulness Based Stress ReductionDawson Church -trained with him for clinical EFTCarl Rogers - father of client centered psychotherapyIrvin Yalom - wrote the book on group therapyMaya Angelou - poet, actress, social activistMaxine Hong Kingston Robert Thurman - Buddhist scholar (and father of Uma Thurman)Daniel Brown -trained with him at Esalen - Harvard professor and Buddhist meditation teacherJoseph Goldstein - Buddhist meditation teacherJean Shinoda Bolen - autograph onlyJames Hollis - Jungian psychologistGary Craig - Founder of EFTMich Albon - author of Tuesdays with Morrie, The 5 People You Meet in HeavenJean Houston - psychologist and author of The Possible HumanDaniel J Seigel - psychiatrist who believes in meditation, not medicationGotswami Amit - quantum physicist Charles Tart - transpersonal psychologistRam Dass - formerly Richard Alpert - Tim Leary’s cohort at HarvardNeale Donald Walsh - author of the Conversations with God seriesOriah Mountain Dreamer - author of The Invitation and The DanceCarolyn Myss - intuitive healerJoan Boryshenko - psychologist Marianne Williamson - author of Return to Love - an interpretation of A Course in MiraclesSandra Ingerman - Soul RetrivalDeepak Chopra - physician and authorDavid Feinstein - researcher in EFTJudy Neale - creator of Spirit in BusinessDick Gregory - activistClarrisa Pinkola Estes - author of Women Who Run with the WolvesDavid FeinsteinSandra Ingerman - author of Soul RetrievalAuthors I’ve interviewed on my Radio Show(s)Dawson Church, Ph.D.David Richo, Ph.D.Jennifer Wade, Ph.D.Gregg LevoyJenny Johnston - EFTer from AustraliaAileen NoblePlaces I've Been for Work or Pleasure Oahu, HawaiiBahamasSt. ThomasSt. JohnsTortollaThe Grand CanyonHoover DamHoward Hughes RanchNYCDenver, COOmaha, NEChicago, IL - many times for the theater, museums, and aquariumSeattle, WAPortland, ORSan Diego, CAMonterey, CAEsalen Institute in Big Sur, CASan Francisco, CALas Vegas, NV - 3 times...still, meh...Tuscon, AZWinslow, AZ - yes, I did sing "standing on the corner in Winslow, AZ..."

It’s sad.I came from a dysfunctional family, which had downstream effects on my life. I can look at where I am today and trace how the contours of that life led me to being alone today.When I was 5 years old, I was left alone. I went to kindergarten on the bus alone, and came home on the bus alone. I walked home from the bus stop alone. Because it was midday (I went to a half-day school that ended at noon), I’d get hungry. I used a chair to climb the kitchen counters to get peanut butter and bread. Then I’d lay on the kitchen floor, cuddling the family dog, and wait for an adult to come homeI was sexually assaulted by a family acquaintance from age 6 to 10. When I told my parents about the abuse, and asked for help, they didn’t respond to me or comfort me. They didn’t get me help or intervene. I spent half my living memory (my first memories were at age 2) being sexually exploited and terrorized.My father beat me. He would hit me in the face and call me a bitch and a slut. He went into rages for the smallest of infractions. He took my bedroom door off its hinges. He threatened me. He threw things, called me big-ass, and made sexist comments and jokes. In his shadow, I grew up feeling small and afraid.My mother was emotionally and psychologically abusive. She stood by while my father beat me. Then, while I held my bloody face in my hands, she would tell me what a bad person I was. I was awful. I was unlovable. I was difficult. I was angry (who wouldn’t be). When she wasn’t telling me to my face what a terrible child I was, she was leaving hate notes on my bed or in my backpack. (Kind of like a perverse Hallmark commercial.)She bullied me in private and eroded my sense of self worth. She did this by making me wear shabby clothing, poking fun of my looks and my body, and shaming me. When I was a teenager, she sometimes came into the bathroom when I showered and stood there, silently watching over me. It was scary and bizarre. I sometimes questioned whether she had been there or if I had imagined it.I overheard my mother instigating the violent incidents between me and my father. She’d go to him and lie about how bad I was, or conjure stories about how I was disrespectful.Despite these hardships, I managed to do well at school. I escaped the pain of my circumstances by keeping my head buried in my books.College was hard because my parents exploited me financially. They had diverted my financial aid payments to themselves. I was so brainwashed and shell-shocked that I was afraid to confront them. When I eventually did, largely out of desperation, my needs were dismissed and I was called a liar. Later, in an act of vengeance, they stole my computer out of my dorm room. They did some other fucked up stuff to undermine and control me, but it would take too long to write about that here.I graduated, against all the odds. I moved in with my college boyfriend and we planned our future together. My life felt hopeful and promising. Then, a couple of years after graduation, the unthinkable happened. My parents committed a crime.You might think, “I’d never cover up for my awful family,” or “let them suffer the consequences.” But my parents were extraordinarily bad people, and so, too were their fuckups. It was the kind of crime that, if revealed, would hurt people and ruin all of us. My sibling and I were caught up in shitty circumstances that were not of our own design.We hired a lawyer and were advised that we should pay people off and run out the clock on the statute of limitations.My sibling and I dealt with the legal and financial consequences for almost a decade. I had to leave my boyfriend, as I didn’t want him implicated. It was painful to pack up my stuff and leave behind the love of my life, for reasons I couldn’t ever explain. I cried every night for years, and watched him move on to another woman. A part of me died when he married her. Another part of me felt relieved that he’d found love again.I eventually found myself in another relationship, but because I was hiding so much and dealing with so many toxic behaviors, I didn’t attract a good person. My circumstances meant I was often frustrated, scared, anxious and tired. In time, it was easier for me to believe the worst: that I was fucked up because I came from a fucked up family. I carried around their fucked up secrets and fucked up legacy. No one could kind or healthy could love this fucked up girl.Predictably, my next boyfriend abused me. I knew it was unhealthy and made many attempts to leave. He was volatile, though, and I was now under the thumb of my equally volatile family. One day, I asked my parents to help me leave him, while I sobbed into the phone. My mother said it wasn’t her business and she wouldn’t get involved. She hung up on me. I eventually found the courage and resources to leave him on my own.I was terrified to date again. I spent five years abstaining from sex and relationships, focusing on recovery from the abuse and survival — a task made all the more difficult, given the fact that I was living with a terrible secret that I couldn’t discuss in therapy. But eventually, the statute of limitations had ended.At the end of this, my sibling and I had paid exhorbitant amounts of hush money and legal fees. I realized that I had wasted my youth and some prime earning years. I woke up and I realized that I was sad, scared, broke, old and alone.My friends had married, had children, reached their professional and financial goals, while I had languished in my own private hell. It hurt that my circumstances made it hard to be a “together” person. I knew that my friends privately wondered why someone smart and ambitioud could turn out to be so unhinged.When I recently had a health issue that required support, my parents didn’t feel any obligation to me. They abandoned me and left me on my own. And my sibling lives too far away to be able to help,I was in free fall and it was terrifying. I survived and got through it, but it was not easy. Aside from my material needs, there were moments when I yearned for affection, reassurance, a loving and healing touch. It made me realize that I was truly alone, and, save for my one sibling, always had been.I would like to fall in love at 40 and create a life with someone. To have a chance at a healthy family. To create the loving environment I never had, and to share my love with another person.I’ve done the hard work of unraveling the past and coming to terms with it through intensive trauma therapy. I’ve “re-parented” myself, healed my wounds of neglect (as best as one can, anyway) and tried to create a life of integrity. I’ve focused on my inner and outer beauty, and remained open to people without attaching a lot expectations to outcomes.I was hopeful at first. But modern dating is hard and even harder when you’re 40. So I’m still alone. I’ve come to terms with it and just tried to be happy where I am. Fortunately, I’ve learned how to be alone and to create some joy in my life. I volunteer, give my time to people hurting more than I am, and have made a chosen family out of my dearest and closest friends.There are times that I grieve. Occasionally, I’ll lie in bed and the still of the night feels oppressive and hard to bear. It feels so, so unfair. I sob for what was lost and what will never be.When these days come, I comfort myself by pretending that there’s someone who listens and cares. I talk to myself aloud and recount my story, while imagining a sympathetic other. They’re compassionate and understanding. They acknowledge my loss, they say all the right things.I guess that sounds a little crazy, but loneliness and isolation can be a crazy-making situation.

Marriage is merely a societal construct and there are thousands of people who choose not to tread that path. Does it make you happier? That solely depends on YOU. I know a woman who chose not to marry. Everyday, she wakes up, goes on a run, makes herself breakfast, gets the most difficult things done at work (no matter how long it takes because there are no familial duties to pressure her), and then celebrates by going to a bar with her friends, dancing her heart out and possibly, meeting more fun people. Her weekends comprise of the most exciting adventures people usually have on their bucket lists- skydiving, scuba diving, visiting homeless shelters, tutoring little children, learning to cook, you name it. "What happens when you turn 50?", I once asked her. "I'll do things that give me the same adrenaline rush and not necessarily a heart attack", she replied confidently. The fact that you're alone, does NOT mean that you're lonely; it means you can be strong enough to conquer the day, conquer the world by yourself.I also knew a woman who never married and spent her entire life wanting to find someone. She would always make sad jokes about her lonely life that evoked pity from everyone around her. She got so tired of her boring daily routine that she began to resent herself. She did nothing to change her situation and badmouthed happy couples behind their backs instead. So it could turn out either way. It's up to you to decide what kind of an unmarried person you want to be. Personally, I don't understand why most people constantly feel the need to have a significant other to complete their lives. Maybe we are scared to be alone, or maybe we need someone who believes in us, who loves us, even when we don't. While all of these reasons are valid to some extent, who says marriage is the only solution?! You can have friends, family and most importantly, YOURSELF, to fall back on. You don't need to wait for love and companionship. Make the most your life; you only need yourself to do that!

What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?"It's not that I don't like people, I just don't like being around uninteresting, unreliable people or drama queens.A little context here.  I think the spirit of the question regards those who have never married and prefer to be alone by choice.  I was married for 21 years before my wife died of cancer in 2012.  However, I've always been a bit of a loner...since before I was married and have been again since my wife passed three years ago.Short version.  Regarding friends.  I do a lot of things on my own because I have unique interests that others might not share. (visiting Lawrence Livermore labs, JPL, observatories, factory tours and museums).  I often find others unreliable, have annoying habits, don't have enough time or money, or that they may become irritating after a few days together.  If I want to go somewhere I hate waiting on others or have to compromise my plans because they aren't interested in some portion of the adventure.  I'd love to have you along but I'm doing this whether you're coming or not. Regarding companionship.  My wife and I were a perfect match and could be joined at the hip for days on end and never get on each others nerves.  Since her passing I've dated a few women but no one is the complete package as my wife was.  I'm now in my 50's and find that anyone in that age group has a lot of baggage...ex husbands, crappy adult kids, health problems, weight problems, money problems and, or they're reluctant to venture too far from their friends or family.I know I'm being very picky about having to have a perfect relationship but I just don't want to compromise very much.  The way I see it I'd rather be alone and deal with the loneliness than make a commitment and be unhappy with some aspect of it.  Am I selfish?  Maybe, but that's the way I roll.Long storyWhen I was in my 20's and prior to meeting my wife I was serving in the military (Coast Guard).  I took advantage of all the benefits the service offered, especially time off to explore the places where I was stationed.  To my friends and shipmates I often proposed ski trips, surfing, hiking, seeing national parks and whatever was in a few days driving distance.Sometimes they didn't want to go on these little adventures, or they didn't have the money, or wanted to just sit around and drink or play video games.  I was determined to take advantage of seeing and doing everything possible even if it meant going alone. I wasn't going to waste the opportunity because of unmotivated people and I knew I would regret not doing these things later in life, so I set off to do and see stuff by myself if necessary.  As a young single guy in my 20's I went on many of these adventures alone.  Sure, sometimes I'd go with a friend or a group, but it was much easier to make my own plans, go when and where I wanted without having to factor in all the problems of getting someone to go along and all the coordination it involved.

What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?
I am seriously warning you against taking any consideration of answers posted by anybody here including me. I am 23 and have never been in a relationship, so I am not at all qualified to answer your question, but seriously! Are others?Most of the people answering the question are with their own narrow cultural perspective. In western countries marriage is trial and failure. It's something they desire (a successful and long lasting one), but not necessarily need. They can go on fall in love at 40's and keep dating in 50's. Whereas in eastern countries it's a compulsion. Most people marry practical strangers with their family's approval. But marriages hardly break and end in divorce. Why am I stressing on this cultural difference? Choice!!! If you have a choice of things and you can choose any one of these lives, it will not impact you harshly. But as soon as you miss the train you will be devastated if you make a wrong decision. So, that much for how long you can remain in this dilemma. I now come to your real question.What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?Incredibly lonely!!! You may think that you will enjoy life, have cool friends ... blah...blah. But just ask me one thing. Suppose this new year you want to spend with your friend and so does her wife who is with him for last 30 years. Who is bound to be left alone on such many occasions?  You won't have that special somebody who will regard you as their world.Moreover, the fun will end one day. Whatever you may like today, you will not love doing the same thing 20 years from hence. Sad part - you want to have anybody with you to share this. Again the people you see who are very happy despite being single are very highly driven ones. They have married their professions. But for every single successful person you can find, you will find 100 committed people who are more successful and have led happier lives.Yeah, granted not all married people have happy lives. But when they grow old at least they will have somebody to share their regrets and mistakes with, if not the happy moments. Believe me, after a certain time you will certainly lose your beauty, then your health and then you will be cold and there will be no charm, friendliness in you. Your parents or siblings might be dead or not with you. But there will be this one person you grew old with. With whom you shared so much that now you care not how they look, feel or say. You love them for what they are. And then one of you may die earlier than the other. The other one will come to farewell on your last journey. Is it not worth it? Is not breaking your heart a couple of times worth it?Your answer:Negative Case:You will be lonely, sad, and regretful of life. If unlucky, also unhealthy. Probably hire somebody to look after yourself. And end up giving everybody to your caretaker because you have no one to pass on your legacy.Positive Case:You will have a very eventful life full of buzz. You will be busy most of your time working and accomplishing a lot. You may not miss anybody. Then you will sometimes come back home. Or too sick or old to work. Then you again will be lonely.
some context on why i am eligible to give answer-this year end I will be 33I am staying alone since 2012, alone means I share flat but I go out alone for movies and dinner.I work from home and sometimes it is like for 2 weeks the only person whom i get to interact is my cook.why I am unmarried when all my friends have kids?My parents are handling matrimonial profile from last 6–7 years.height- 5’6”complexion- wheatish brown, gets tan very easily and add-on is oily sweaty skin ( my parents keep asking me to mention it wheatish in matri profile whereas others see it as dark )salary- more than enoughResponse received on matri- Not a single family meeting could be arranged during these years on matriReason- I don’t know, nobody showed interest, those who accepted interest didn’t communicated to proceed further.Met couple of girls by contacting them myself on a different matri account, they all said no in first meeting and yes they didn’t offer to split the bill.Relationships in life - zeroDates so far - 3 girls from north east, yes only 3 dates in 6 years on tinder/truly-madly/aisle, seems girls from north east don’t care much about complexionAfter analyzing the response on matri and dating apps, i know i am not getting marriedNow people will say sometimes you have to lower your expectations-right, but considering the response received in matri market, I don’t see any value in lowering the expectations to such a level that you end up whining whole life in an uncertain private job to make money for kids born out of an unattractive partner because nobody else said YES. I don’t see any point in that, others may have different opinion.So how it is to stay unmarried and alone? - so far it has not been that bad, recently joined a new company, working on new stuff, doing workout, keeping track of macros and calories, last Sunday watched john wick, this Sunday Chernobyl, started planning early retirement.how would it be to stay unmarried and alone? - not sure about how would it be like after 5, 10 or 20 years, all i know is there are few things you can’t control, it is not necessary that you get to experience everything what others get, also it is not necessary to get into every fight like partner is cheating when you are coding in office.What about emotional health and balance? - better do not depend on someone for emotional balance, learn to be at ease and peace, you can train your mind, train your mind to think what you want it to think.when unmarried, you could do more in life, you could choose to do something for society after taking early retirement, there is lot to do in big country India, you will never get bored alone.Key would be to keep yourself in the best possible state- best state of mind, health and bank balance.
What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?
I'm a 30-year-old woman, never married, childless, and am splitting time between summer holidays at home with my parents in Southeast Asia, and the rest of the year doing my masters in a "Western" country, where I live with flatmates. I'm an involuntarily celibate straight demisexual... which means that I like only men but do not experience sexual attraction unless I've developed emotional attachment first, and that I prefer to be part of a couple but been unable to find a sexual partner/engage in sexual activity for reasons beyond my control. My last long-term relationship ended 3, almost 4 years ago, and I haven't been able to find someone else since.For the most part, my single life since 27 has been awesome. I quit my job and became a travel writer. I'm working out and taking good care of myself. I'm currently on a prestigious scholarship that provides me the opportunity to live in between countries and gaining some enriching experiences and perspectives. I'm studying a subject I deeply care about, and traveled some more as part of researching my thesis. I wrote a book and am in the process of fine editing for publishing next week. I'm collaborating with a visual artist, a filmmaker, and musicians, to tell the story of my book through other media and engage a wider audience with a beautiful message we strongly believe in. Financially I'm doing relatively well, and I believe it will only get better from here. And I'm dreaming bigger dreams for the coming few years: writing more books, get my own column in a prominent newspaper or magazine, found a tech startup and a clothing company, set up a philanthropic initiative, and travel some more to create, inspire, and collaborate.I am proud of who I've become, and I wouldn't give this up for a marriage.That said, ever since I hit my late teens/early twenties, I've had this innate desire for marriage and children, and it has only grown stronger over time. I love being in love with a man I genuinely admire and respect—it is a rare occurrence though—and always hoped that I'll find my "happily ever after". I believe I'd make a great partner and wife, and people who know my track record in relationships would confirm that I'm one who makes deliberate effort to appreciate my partner, communicates concerns in a diplomatic and considerate way, actively listens and gives my undivided presence, defines my principles and stands up for them, fights fair in conflicts, forgives each other, dreams future goals together and committing to them, be by my partner's side when the going gets tough, takes good care of the home and is well versed in doing the "business" side of the relationship (finances, property, responsibilities). So in my view, I deserve to be married because I can bring a lot to the table and make someone's life happier and more beautiful. But that also means that I deserve someone who can and will commit to doing as much for me as I do for him, and accepts the life I've been living before he came into the picture. I won't marry a man who says, "Party's over, no more long solo travels and writing career for you. Now make me dinner and give me a blow job because as your husband now I call the shots over your life." Though my life will undoubtedly change after marriage and kids, the man I marry has to appreciate the life and person I've developed into over all these years, encourage me to continue being who I am, and would dream new dreams with me (that includes him and kids in the picture) that respects the continuation of that life path I've built way before he came into the picture.Despite my desire for marriage, since I was a little girl I've developed a strong aversion to patriarchy (the system in which men hold the dominant power, unfairly subjecting women to serve men's interests at the expense of their own). Being brought up in a conservative Christian household, I've been taught that in order for a marriage  and motherhood to work, women need to tolerate a little bit of patriarchy because that's "God's way." I later became an agnostic after my parents separated due to my father's affair with another woman, and got back together because apparently my mother can't live without him (and wanted to "obey God's will," avoiding ostracising from the church community that's become the centre of her universe.)In addition to these, I had a sex-negative upbringing (meaning that as an adolescent I was discouraged from expressing attraction to boys and developing relationships with them). When I finally had my first relationship at ages 18-19, I got myself an abusive boyfriend while living away from my family and friends on the other side of the world. My life got better at 21-22... in hindsight I probably should have spent those early prime years prioritising finding a partner... but I was broke, fighting personal demons and trying to start my life over, so I figured that it was only responsible to make myself better first before opening up to a relationship.When I was 24, I started a 3-year relationship with a guy who had been a good friend since I was 18, and was there for me when I was breaking up with my abuser. I thought he was the love of my life and was preparing to marry him. Unfortunately he wasn't willing to deal with my past or plan a future, just wanted to clip my wings when I try to dream, and always had to prove that he's smart and I'm dumb... which in hindsight, I guess, is a form of abuse as well. But of course nobody else sees it because he's otherwise a gentle, polite and nice guy with a great, respectable career--other people generally think he's a good man and my father had high hopes on him. Anyway, the life I'm living now is one that I've been dreaming about ever since I was with him... and I dreamed it in such a way hoping that the things I do would teach me how to be a great wife for him (read paragraph 4). I chose a writing career because it gives me the flexibility to work from home and immerse my children in my world as I teach them life lessons, values, and how to dream their future. I have no fear that being married or having children would take away the awesome life I'm living now--though it will mean that I'll have to start planning my life around them and be creative in providing for them experiences that make them fall in love with life itself. If anything, I want the opportunity to let marriage and children transform the life I have right now into something more enriching--even if it means constantly keeping my ego in check, putting up with pet peeves, making financial sacrifices, and dealing with dirty diapers. But my pre-condition for saying "yes" to marriage is that my spouse would have to be willing to accommodate the things I believe matter most to life--both by being part of it, and by giving me the freedom to feed my soul as an individual (so that I have life and spark to colour his world and that of our children).I've since yet to find a man who's willing to share that kind of life with me. When I was 22, good prospectable single men were all over me, but at 27-28 they're all suddenly gone. The next boyfriend I had was a 3-month fling from work, with whom I shared great chemistry, who expressed the closest thing I've ever had to a partner supportively believing in my dreams, encouraged me to be a better person, and led me on to believe that he was in love with me. So I developed real feelings for him, which I expressed liberally when I thought it was mutual... only to find out later that he didn't mean it. This fling, so far, is the only man I've ever slept with (the other guy I almost married was a practicing Christian who intended to have us "save ourselves"... so when we broke up after 3 years without ever kissing or having sex, I surprisedly felt defeminised and extremely hurt). When my fling left, what hurts most was the impression that he gave up on me because I'm not worth fighting for. It made me feel that there's something inherently defective with me. If there's nothing wrong with me, then how come men don't love me and won't commit to me? I feel like I'm that gorgeous mansion on a secluded cliff outlooking the sea--the kind everyone says they want but nobody actually buys because it's too expensive, requires high maintenance, and takes effort getting to and from. Everytime a prospective buyer decides against buying the mansion, I renovate and make it an even nicer place to call home. But instead of attracting new buyers I scare my prospects even more because I just added extra zeros behind the price and won't settle for less. At best, I get renters who would hire the proverbial mansion to host parties over the weekend but won't lift a finger to clean up their mess. Like, why is it so hard to just find someone who thinks I'm worth it? Or should I just watch this mansion eventually crumble in its old age and go to waste without ever having to house a good family that would take great care of it?I tried dating but after seeing many guys whose names I have trouble remembering, I find it pointless and too hard to keep up with. Dates are when strangers put their best foot forward to try to get into someone else's pants. What I want is someone who I can get to know in the real world and grow real feelings for before I decide to share my body with them. Western culture's "three date rule" absolutely disgusts me--I would much rather have an arranged marriage with someone my parents vouch is good for me, than have sex with a strange man I've only had three dinners with. So most of the time I just stop calling after the first or second date.The men I've developed serious relationships with had never been men I met through "dates", and always been someone I knew in the context of a community--college, church, or work. Unless I have the opportunity to observe the man candidly in this context, I can't know him well enough to decide whether he's worth committing to. And since I've both developed a super-independent personality and a history of traumatic relationship, I've tended to develop what I'd call "damsel in distress syndrome" as a precondition for falling in love. I only fall in love with some men who stand by me in a crisis, because this suggests to me that I'll be able to rely on him to stay with me and face rough patches together in the future ... and I've find it hard to change this precondition even after having been proven wrong. And that sucks because I can't wish for or deliberately create a crisis, because that's against my principles and doing so would make me a desperate idiot undeserving of the man that falls for it... nor should a man put me in a crisis for the sake of saving me as my "knight in shining armour" because that would make him a deceitful asshole undeserving of me.Because of this, I've decided to give up on dating. As I've said in the beginning, the life I live right now is awesome enough, and I don't want my childlessness and lovelessness to sabotage my happiness. That said, the heart wants what it wants, and I have a marriage-shaped hole in my heart that nothing else can fill. The best I can do is to make peace with that void and live with it. It doesn't mean I don't cry myself to sleep some nights, or stare at my naked body in the mirror with regret, thinking what if I grow old without ever making love again, or having the chance to bear children. And admittedly on some days I wonder whether there is a point of continuing what I do if I don't get to have a loving husband to grow old with and children to pass on my legacy. I remember traveling to one of the most beautiful places in the world last year and staring out the bus window just sobbing, thinking what if this awesome single life I'm living means doing without something else I also want so much?That said, I still have a few more prime years to go, and till those years are gone, I'll keep a small flicker of hope in my heart... not so big that I'm set for disappointment, but just enough to grasp the opportunity should a miracle happen. I'll keep preparing mentally and financially for the prospect of a future marriage and kids, but not actively look for it. I'd rather focus my energy on the life I do have, maximising and being grateful for it.If I don't get partnered by 36, then I'd consider Single Motherhood by Choice (SMC) as a compromise. But I can't tell my friends and family because many would think I'm dishonouring myself. Sperm donors and adoption isn't legally available for unmarried persons in my country, so probably I'll have to get knocked up over a fling, or wreck a friendship or a job or someone else's marriage... and I'm done crying with disappointment over myself for the thought of doing these things... but I have my heart set that whatever I have to do to make my child(ren) happen will be worth it. In a semi-ideal world, the father would be a good man who then decides he loves me and wants to raise this child with me as my husband until we both grow old. But even if he  pisses off and I never see him again, I'd at least have a child who I'd hopefully be able to single-handedly love unconditionally, provide for, and raise into a good person who loves life. And I'm sure that somehow I'll have a community that loves this child almost as much as I do, who will have my back in my efforts to provide a safe, loving, responsible and honourable environment for this child to grow up in.And if that fails as well by the time I'm 40, then I'll get my PhD in Peace Studies or something related that I care about with my life, and get myself posted in a particular war zone where my set of political beliefs is likely to get me killed. (No, that doesn't count as suicide.) Best case scenario, I'd somehow make it there safely, volunteer locally in a youth programme, mentor some kids/adolescents who come to look up to me as a mother figure, and will keep coming back to me when they're grown and I'm old. Worst case scenario, I die young fighting for something honourable, people who respect my work mourn my death and honour my memory even if from a distance, and nobody has to worry about me growing old alone.So yeah... that's my personal experience of being unmarried and living alone. Thank you for asking this question and providing me with the opportunity to talk about something I can't talk about most of the time.

If you don’t want to marry than it’s very good to be unmarried, don’t go for it just for the sake of our so called “society”.WHY?It’s your life, live it in your own way, if you don’t see any person as your life partner then don’t marry. It’s okay, no problem. Don’t think about the society that what they think, what they said and all. There are so many rules made by society for us, but please don’t follow them blindly. If something seems to be wrong than please don’t follow it. I am not asking you to bring change in whole society, but at least start to take a step for yourself when you know you are right. This step will start a new journey of yours, completely yours.I know people are always ready to show you direction whether they are clear or not about this. They expect you to follow it, reason: at some stage of their life they followed the same so they want you to do the same. Just because it’s our custom we have to follow that right? This is society. And if you started following them then you will have to follow them throughout your life, at each stage of your life. And after some year you are one of them and you will do the same as they did. YES, this is going to happen if you don’t take step for yourself. At the end you just have regret left with you, or else it will become your nature to compromise, and you will start to believe that this is life. And if you want to see the examples, see around yourself, there are many to save you by revealing there life to you.Now consider the second scenario,Here people force you to marry because this is their so called custom. But you are clear about it, so you don’t marry. Here the change comes, now in the starting people will keep talking about you some bla..bla. But you are busy in making your life, you are clear about what you want to do in your life and what you want from life. You are continuously making efforts for that. You are busy in exploring your new world with your rules in your own ways. You make your decision on your own. You get everything of your will not on the society’s terms. And when you are successful, this society praises you, at that time they want to be with you in your way with your rules. People start respecting you, because you learnt how to respect yourself and your decision.So decision is all yours what you want.“Give a chance to yourself to live what you want to live not what others want you to live.” Then see the life how beautiful it is….Start your DREAM LIFE with one single step.

To be able to clarify your query basically you are supposed to overcome basic instincts such as lust that is the toughest one to overcome initially.Secondly you are compelled to exercise Chastity as well as asetic Life . Coitus is one basic instinct and one of the biological needs where human beings can not control for sure.You can not live without food water sleep and ​what not​ ? Marriage is an institution where people from two opposite sexes join together as one flesh.Can live without marriage it depends on how you react towards the issue.. Take your own time and make up your mind for sure.In the topical scenario owing to influences controlling ones mind against physical intimacy is just impossible.Hope differed maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh it is a tree of Life.
Who knows for sure if you will not regret staying unmarried in your old age?Can u say for sure that you will never regret staying unmarried all your life? Even when you are 50 plus years age?No marriage in India, means no family or no children of your own. Are you sure you will grow old without regretting not having a family?Marriage means companionship. Forget whether the society allows you or not, will you be happy all your life living alone?
Im 23(M) and my mom is hell-bent on marrying me off. Im not mentaly prepare for such responsibility. Study, career, job, No matter what reason I throw at her she won't listen.My relatives think my marriage is their responsibility (but only socially, not financially).If someone is more eager for my marriage than my mom it's my neighbor who thinks I'm so into his daughter.SO, YEAH… ITS NOT EASY BEING UNMARRIED FOR WHOLE LIFE IN INDIA.

Now a days it's OK we can't say it's OK, but you want to become celibacy, society will criticise and allegation on you, they think you something lagging in your body or may be you are can't responsible person means there is no difference bw you and street dog, in India people's are think as like that, you can't tolerate this then immigrate to another country may be they will accept I hope so.
It totally depends on you.But if you really don’t want to get married I think that is fine. My Uncle did not marry and he is living happily till now.I asked him once “Don’t you regret not getting married watching other families and having kids”.He smiled and said “I never once in my life had regretted my decision. It was completely my decision.I help lots of people and children .And I become a part of their family.If I had married I would have just been a part of only one family”.Just do what you feel .If you don’t want then don’t get married
Dear friend,Getting married or not is completely your own decision. Do not think what others will say. Also, according to Indian society it is good to get married rather than being unmarried for life but yes there still exist people who are happy socially accepted and unmarried.
From a mental health point of view, its better to get married !Man is a social animal, he needs company. And marriage expands or creates social circle for lonely people. The pros > cons 1000% sure. In case you end up with a bad partner and cons > pros then you can go find a different partner. Loving solitude too much is not good sign.

I personally believe that depending on what you think or believe it could be good for you, if you long or crave for a partner your whole life its going to be rough. If you are instead developing your true self, and finding out who you are for your whole life then you probably won't feel as bad as you think you would. Because you were discovering the world and yourself rather than searching for the answer to other peoples questions.I think of the hedgehog's dilemma where Schopenhauer talked about how when hedgehog's got too close in the winter when looking for warmth, they'd prick each other and then back far away. He believed you had to keep a certain distance away from society, to not get pricked, and to not prick anyone.

What is it like to live alone?
Living alone can be hell or heaven depending on your personality type. For me, it was a step ahead of heaven.Last year, I lived alone for 3 months and this was in a foreign country in a 5 bedroom house. I locked up all rooms except mine. All I used was my room, a bathroom and a kitchen.Why it was easy:I could cook whatever I wanted, well not whatever but however I wanted it. I like the extra spice and extra detailing to the cooking. Weekends were dedicated to cooking and groceries.I bought a bike and it served me well for the grocery shopping. When I went grocery shopping alone for the first time in my life, I picked just processed, preserved, unhealthy stuff. My mom almost had a panic attack when she saw a picture of my glorious shopping. I gradually moved to the fruits, vegetables and natural foods section and I eradicated the possibility of unconsciously killing myself.Also, with the bike, I explored a minimum of five temples, two buddhist monasteries and two libraries. Only with a bike and a bus pass! It’s so easy to go wherever you want when no one is rolling their eyes every time you want to go to the temple or the library.Not caring a damn about what I’m wearing. I could wear an ancient yet favorite T-shirt from the days of the Indus valley civilization or I could wear a snug, personally faded, torn jeans pant and nobody would bat an eye.Talking of clothes, I never retrieved clothes from the dryer to fold them and put them into the closet, I never even used the laundry basket to put used clothes. This is how it was for three months - put in dirty clothes into the washer, wait till it is filled with dirty clothes, wash, transfer all clothes to dryer, pick one cloth everyday from the dryer and wear it. Once all clothes in the dryer are finished, repeat. Ah! sweet life.Sing. You have no idea how nice it is to sing for yourself. Any song…any damn song and anywhere in the house. I sang in the shower, I sang while I cooked, I sang while I got ready…you name it. I belted innumerable songs! I shuffled, mixed and remixed better than most music players ;)Bye bye headphones. When you’re the only person in the house, why use the headphones? I played songs, audio books and movies in full volume…nobody to complain.What was tough at first but then became easy:Cooking was definitely tough at first but then it soon became an art and I enjoyed doing it.There is a glass door to one of the rooms. Every time I walked by it, my reflection moved along with me and for 3.635 milli seconds, before I knew that it’s my own reflection, I freaked out; I froze the first time! This happened for almost a week and then my system learnt that it’s alright.Horror movies were a complete no no during the first two-three weeks. They were totally fine after some time. I watched Conjuring, Black Water and Paranormal activity at night and slept like a baby.My schedule:Wake up at 5:30 AM. Take a bath and play Vishnu Sahasranama (Sanskrit Shloka) and other daily shlokas and mantras right after getting out of the bathroom.Eat a fruit/vegetable and make some easy breakfast and pack light snacks.Leave home at 6:30 AM to attend a 7:30 AM class. Bike till the bus stop and get into the bus.12:30 PM the class done. Get into a bus back home.There was an Indian restaurant near the place where I locked my bike. I used to buy some sambar/rasam/dal if I didn’t feel like cooking that day.Bike back home and eat lunch.Rest/write/watch a movie/read a book/solve a jigsaw puzzle till 3:00 PM.Study till 6:00 PM.Head to the park for a jog/bike/do yoga till 7:30 PM.Make dinner or just finish up what was done for lunch. Eat at 8:00 PMRead something while dozing off by 10:00–10:30 PM.Repeat.Like I said, special dishes, special destinations and special activities like meditation classes and retreats were dedicated to weekends.My accomplishments in three months of peaceful solitude:Read 11 books - reread Krishna: The Man and His Philosophy, A Scientist’s Search for Truth, reread Angels and Demons, reread Lost Symbol, reread Deception Point, Eat Pray Love, Briefer History of Time, The Hidden Reality, Take it Easy, Anatomy and Physiology for Nurses and 3 mistakes of my life. I still regret reading the last one.Practised music - my mom loves me a bit more for this one :DLearnt cooking while learning the difference between two types of yellow grams - toor dal and chana dal. Don’t judge me. See it for yourself, it is tough to differentiate!Understood that I consume normal amounts of salt and cooking oil. Since I lived alone, I knew exactly how much salt and cooking oil I consumed in a day. Mom and dad were happy about my diet. Mind you, my dad is a Yoga professor, it is tough to satisfy him!Solved a 2000 piece (first pic) and a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle.Cinque Terre, Italy painting - Buffalo Games:Starry Night, Vincent Van Gogh - EuroGraphics:Would I do this being-alone thing again? Hell yeah, without a doubt!I loved my company. I was alone but I wasn’t lonely even for a single moment. There was not one moment of boredom, remorse or conflict. I was in love and I did not need anyone to love. It’s ok if you don’t get it now. You’ll get it when you have my mental maturity ;)Remember, if you cannot live with yourself, you cannot live with anyone else. The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it is not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of the other person—without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other.- Osho

Can living alone ever be joyous?
Is it wise to live alone?
Do you prefer to live alone? Why or why not?
I have been living alone since 2006. It’s a long period. Although, there were times when for few weeks, I was with others and then again alone and it continued. But at the most, I have been alone. Made all decisions alone. Gone through everything alone.Therefore, I can give an insight to how is it like to live alone.I will share my current routine and then give my conclusions to which many of you may disagree.Here we go,I get up at 5 or 6 depending on either it’s summer or winter time.I do worship to Almighty. (For some of you maybe it’s surprising but Yes, I really do)I go for a short morning walk.I prepare my breakfast at 8 or maybe even late.My office is 300m away from my home. I, don’t go to office everyday. My employees are working there according to their timetables. There are cameras installed everywhere and I can view almost every activity on my laptop or mobile. If I have to attend important meeting or discuss some issues with employees, I do visit my office for few hours. But most of the time, I monitor them from home. This gives me more time alone.I cook my lunch at 13–00 or maybe at 14–00. Since, I live alone, I am free to choose whatever I like.If I need to go for some shopping or groceries, I usually do it after lunch.I go to gym in the evening, sometimes I don’t go to gym. I may also go for swimming. Sometimes I go for a walk. The park is 100m away from home. No big deal.After workout, I prepare my dinner. Sometimes, I invite my friends over and gossip in the weekend. Sometimes, I go out with them.Sometimes I watch movie alone. If its a good comedy e-g: Ruby and Quentin, I do laugh a lot. I like it.What else? If I feel sleepy, I go to bed early. If not, I stay online and do my stuff.Sometimes, I even don’t speak to anybody for the whole day. (But recently, I got into a relationship and I’m losing my privacy and free time. Let’s see, how it goes this time.)Below is the graphic version of how I live alone:I can cook whatever I like and I can wear whatever I want.That’s now, I’m writing my answer on Quora:You have now enough idea, how it is like to live alone for some people.I would now like to mention the advantages of living alone (or loneliness), which I personally observed.I think each of us sometimes just need to be alone.1- Loneliness purifies our consciousness. During the day, we receive a lot of different information from the media, friends, colleagues and loved ones. We don’t notice how it starts to negatively affect our life. Therefore, sometimes you just need to think about everything in a quiet and peaceful place, where no one will disturb you.2. Creativity also needs silence and tranquility. When we are alone and do not specifically think about anything, our imagination gets freedom and this moment is capable of giving birth to truly beautiful ideas.3. Loneliness helps to strengthen confidence in something. We listen to our inner voice, we weigh the pros and cons on the basis of our own experience, and this is much more important than the opinions of others.4. We become more independent. When we are left alone, we can dream and create goals based on our dreams, which allow us to develop and grow independently.5. Loneliness aggravates perception. Away from the emotions and experiences of the outside world, it is much easier to draw the right conclusions or to take another look at the problem.6. It is necessary to be a little alone to reduce stress and anxiety. This helps to bring thoughts back to normal after a busy day.7. The best way to get to know yourself is to take a short break from communication with others. It will help to find what is really important to us, and set priorities.8. The best way to increase productivity is to be alone to clarify your thoughts, to put your dreams in order and put everything in order. Make strategies to achieve your targets.9- . Loneliness strengthens relationships. Believe it or not, our close people do not need our constant attention. When we have time to understand and appreciate ourselves, we are able to better understand and appreciate others.The list goes on… But I would better stop here.All the best.Edit:Inbox and comment section is so curious of who clicked these pics.- I have mentioned that recently I got into a relationship … Her classes were off yesterday and she came here to have a lunch together. So, she clicked these pictures.

8 months ago, I hit rock bottom. Life seemed unfair. I battled sadness and depression for 4 months. And I reached the ‘Fuck-this!-I’m-out’ moment and chose isolation.I quit my job. I came back home. I changed my phone number. And I cut off every possible acquaintance of mine. In few weeks, I moved out of my home and started living alone.Alone in its truest sense. No friends. No connections. No social media. As a matter of fact, most of my friends have no idea what happened to me.I was on Instagram. I was addicted to endless stalking of what my friends did over the weekend.One day, I had realisations[1]. I quit Instagram. I deactivated it. I haven’t gone back until now. I didn’t use WhatsApp too. I was hurt. And I wanted to deal with it alone.But boredom was my biggest enemy. I had to find alternatives to kill my spare time. I remembered Quora. I started writing.One of my anonymous answers went insanely viral. And suddenly people were appreciating my writing skills. Strangers over the internet were kind enough to spare their time to listen to what I had to say.That was kinder than most of the people in my life. I was and still am thankful for their generosity. I have been writing ever since. Writing is my escape now.Outcome 1: Started writing consistently. Developed hobby #1.I never even learnt to make coffee because I was scared my mom would make me prepare coffee every time for her.Now when I started to live alone, I started cooking. The first day, I called up my mom and she told me the recipe over the phone. I cooked. It was the most delicious sambar I ever had.I haven’t stopped cooking until now. I am passionate about it now.Outcome 2: Found out cooking can be fun. Developed hobby #2.Quora was not the only platform that I use to kill my boredom. I started using Reddit, Tumblr, Medium, Pinterest, Duolingo, Curiosity, The Guardian, Quizup, TED talks and I started reading articles over Pocket.As you notice, all of these platforms aren’t the primary choices of my friends. So, no one will find me here.If I am wasting my time endlessly scrolling through my phone screen then why not gain some knowledge and be productive, right?Every app that I said above builds my character and my personality.I don’t have to look at the food my friends ate last night or the pubs they danced this evening.Outcome 3: I am spending time productively by reading. Developed hobby #3.I started doing Yoga. My mind was a mess. And Yoga saved me. I got addicted to it because the peacefulness that I experience after doing it was priceless.Pro tip: If someone is going through depression, please start doing Yoga. Take a class in Udemy and just start it right away. You will find peace.Outcome 4: I do Yoga. Developed hobby #4. (Hobby because I do it for the joy of doing it and I can kill two hours every day.)After I isolated myself I have met strangers over the internet (Quora). Some have inspired me in the ways even they couldn't even imagine. I’m ever thankful to them.There is joy when you know a stranger gives you time, reads your content and appreciates you. I don’t know any of these strangers completely. In fact, I don’t know them at all. I don’t wanna know either.Strangers with good intentions feel a lot closer than friends who treat you like shit. This has been my motto. And hence the isolation.I am a Ghost now. Not many know what happened to me. I just hope everybody stays ignorant of Quora and never find me here.I talked about the positive side of my isolation. There is a dark side too.Sometimes I feel lonely. I feel like talking to someone about it. And I realise there’s none. At that moment, the feeling is the worst. Those nights, I have cried. I have had sleepless nights, not understanding why me? There is a war going on in my mind about my personality. It might end up affecting me psychologically.I’m doing better now. I am getting used to being alone because I chose this isolation. I have explored myself and my life is better than before. But there is a void. The void created by the people I cared a lot.If you are taking someone for granted in life, then don’t! Karma is a bitch and it will come right back at you.If you are being taken for granted then don’t be in that toxic relationship. Leave. You will suffer. You will be depressed. But the other person doesn’t deserve the time and effort you put into sustaining that relationship.Never leave your self-respect.–HXFootnotes[1] The worth by Raghavendra V on The Hunting Story!
I got married in December 2016 and moved to states with my husband. I was in US for 1.5 years and life was going pretty well until one fine day I realised that I can’t let my career suffer for the sake of living in America. I was on H4 visa (dependent) in which spouse is not allowed to work.So, the career oriented and independent woman soul in me woke up one day & took the charge. After having my husband’s consent I decided to move back to India alone for a while till we get a clear picture about trump moods and green card of course.My sleepless nights started with searching job on linked in & Naukri, because of huge time difference I had to stay up till late night to attend VC interviews. I didn’t want to miss any opportunity as I had a career gap of 1.5 years.By God's grace I got myself a job within 15 days of my stay in India (excluding my late night VC interviews in US). Now the real challenge was waiting ahead, of setting everything from scratch all over again.Earlier my husband was a helping hand in US. But here I was all alone managing everything from searching a house for rent, find a domestic help, buying household stuff, furniture, I had to do all alone.I had moved to Bangalore and rented a flat in BTM, where you only get independent buildings with no lift. My flat is on 4th floor and you can imagine how would it be without lift. I have to climb the stairs 3–4 times a day sometimes, because from throwing trash, buying grocery & going for work all requires me to step out of my house.Few months went by until I got settled, another trauma was waiting for me. After few months I caught my maid stealing money from my wallet so my last resort of some help in household work is also gone. Now like a wonder woman I am working, cleaning dishes, mopping the floor and cook for my self. Yes I know I don’t need gym after that.Life is tough sometimes once you start living alone especially after marriage but living alone independently has its own perks.I have decorated my house as per my whims & fancies with lots of pictures of our memories together.I have the whole bed to myself.I get lot of gifts from my husband time to time just to bring smile on my face after so much hard work I do.I can call my friends anytime for night out.I can wear anything I want, there is no one to judge me. I get enough ME time to do some self introspection.I can cook any random dishes.I had almost forgotten how its like to live alone. I have become more independent. I have started saving money again and done some investments. Living alone has given me a different perspective of life. I have become more cautious and mature.And most importantly, I know his importance in my life now. Its been more than a year we are living away carrying on with our jobs in different countries and hoping to live together again very soon.

I lived alone for 1 year in a studio flat at Koramangala, Bangalore. It was on the fourth floor. With no lift.I used to live in so much peace. I had lived in a hostel before that with 2 roommates and a shared toilet. I have lived through “Hair clogging the drain", “thats my table, dont keep your books on mine", or “I can't sleep without the fan sound, even if it is freezing cold" situations. So it was a big relief for me.But I was 22 at the time I took that decision. The flat was affordable, just 6.5K a month. Thats the price of a 3-sharing PG. So I moved in the flat. Even though I had to climb till the fourth floor, I did.It was very peaceful. A dream house I must say. I had all the time in the world to stay quiet and stare into the sky. The roof was right outside my door, a pretty chilled place to hangout. I could keep the room tidy my way. I could mess it up my way.I bought an induction cooker for preparing food. The water was free. I applied for TV cable. The landlords had given me a TV, an RO filter and a bed with it. Nice people.…Cut to 6 months. I was severely ill.I was staying alone. My parents, friends, well wishers kept calling me and telling me to visit a doctor. I wasn't strong enough to get out of bed. And when I did, I imagined going down the four floors, visiting the doctor who is just by the block, and then return, just to climb the four floors again!I fell back on the bed.My landlady, thankfully, paid a friendly visit. She saw my situations and brought me food and medicines immediately.…Eight months.Company wasn’t paying me enough to manage my expenses. Nor was I getting time to cook food at night. All my money goes in restaurants. I stop paying the TV bills.…10 months.I am unable to take care of the room alone. I can't afford a maid servant who could clean the room. And my health detoriates due to job pressure. I soon begin to regret my decision of staying alone.…12 months.My room looks nasty. I look like a mental patient. I decide to clean the room, and spend three days washing and dusting. I fall sick again. No one to take me to the hospital.My landlords have a relative come from Delhi for higher studies. They politely ask me to move out.I happily move out, find a PG where there's wi-fi, TV, electricity, food etc bills covered in the same 6.5K rent. Only compromise: back to the “drain's clogged”, “my bed”, “don't switch off the fan” drama.But, the same roommates took me to the hospital when I caught Dengue. They even paid my first hospital bill without letting me know. They would visit me twice a day and bring me fruits and juices and soups.At times you need people. You can live alone, yes. But only to an extent. In the longer run its someone you need to look after your little needs. Someone who could bring you a glass of water when you are ill. Someone who could take care of the house once in a while. Someone who could laugh at your jokes, or give you a shoulder to cry. Someone who could share your dinner table and discuss the fun things they did.Yes. We all need someone sometimes.And whats the price?To let go of those little annoying things that bother you. Of course that doesn't apply to totally uncompromising narcissistic bigots, but most people you meet in life will be nice.
What it is like to live alone?
Answering to my own question.What it is like to live alone?Almost one year back in November. I shifted to Gurgaon and as I always enjoyed my own company.I thought of living alone.Flashback:I had pretty cool life in Mumbai. Amazing roommates and those same guys as colleagues.God was making up for my dull and introvert college life.We, being roommates enjoyed a lot. I know it’s fad to call brothers to your friends but we were brothers.I had some amazing colleagues besides these two stupidos (roommates). I loved being there. Loved my work and my after-work-life.Although I always wanted to live alone and walk naked sipping coffee. I wanted to do this but leaving this amazing thing going on wasn’t easy and couldn’t have done it if I wasn’t shifting to whole new city. I made it solid for myself that I need to do this.A decision:So when in Nov’15 when I came here I started living alone.Even after living a week I wasn’t sure about this decision.I didn’t find any sense in walking naked in the room. Days were like doubled their times.I started getting confused about my decision so I put this question on Quora and within 2–3 days I got some really amazing answers.Few of them are,Charu Pathni's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Charu PathniJason T Widjaja's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Jason T WidjajaQuora User's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Quora UserDushka Zapata's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Dushka Zapata (Btw I love your answers)Sachin R Kamath's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Sachin R KamathSo after these and few more answers I started loving the idea of living alone.Thank you guys :)Here are few things I tried out:Walking Naked: Definitely walking naked in the room tops the list. It’s the sign of liberty and Hell I loved it.Dancing: Ohh dancing! I tried it I danced like crazy I know no-one is watching me. What a booster.Cleanliness: I have cleaned whenever I wanted and other days I was sleeping with lunch boxes from restaurants.Listening music: I love listening to music and and type of music totally depends on the moment I’m in. Hell! I never experienced so soothing music before. Volume up and stand in the balcony and let the lyrics pour in your mind with the wind.Silence is deep: I started enjoying silence. It is addictive. It is amazing.Never misplace anything: Ohh ohh! You will find everything wherever you you’ll leave it. Nothing ever will loose anything (mostly).I read: I have Kindle now and I read more than ever. This helped me.Everything you purchase will be used and ruined by only you, no one else.Honeymoon for your tongue: I bring the food I love. I order whenever I feel like hungry. Discussing what to order is not an over-head anymore.Unlimited sleep hours without disturbance: You sleep anywhere you want. You can sleep on floor or on the bed or even in the balcony and nobody will interrupt for anything. On weekends I sleep for hours in days and night. I read when I wake up and then sleep again.Living alone and lonely is totally different.I can study more than I used to. Nobody ever makes fun of that. Nobody calls you geeky or less cooler because of it.Cooking: I tried Cooking, it didn’t work out but I can whenever I want and I’m not afraid of that. Except roti, I couldn’t do it yet.Overthinking: It is not a problem anymore because I’m friend with it. It doesn’t bother me anymore. I’ve learned to let go thoughts.You need nobody: In the end of the day, you don’t need anyone to complete your day.You can bring anybody home: Yes, and no-one will know. Ever! No-one will gossip about it.F.R.I.E.N.D.S: Watch friends on speaker all the time and nobody looses their mind about it.Whole bed is yours you can sleep either side of it. You own whole bed :DTalk to myself: This might seem filmy but I do this and it is one thing that everyone should do. Try to say what you are thinking. Give words to your thoughts and they will be stronger than ever.Love for family: I have started loving my family more than ever. I don’t know how!In short, I’m king of my own little planet whose anthem music is:Cons to living alone: But very few:I surely miss being with Mumbai friends. But I’m sure I would have missed them anyway.I don’t wanna live with anyone anymore. I’m even afraid to get married. I’m afraid how I’ll adjust with her.I want to run back to my little planet if I’m with people for long.But you can see pros outcast cons.One should definitely try once in the lifetime. But beware it is addictive.Thank you for putting the idea of writing an answer to my own question Anangsha Alammyan (Quite tough name to pronounce though). Loved it. Thank you :)
It’s magic!I stay alone for the past 3.5 years. With utmost certainty I can tell you that living on your own is magic. It teaches you responsibility, discipline, importance of freedom and sooo many other things! Sounds like I’m faffing? Let me break it down for you.Independence- You’re on your own. There is no one to do chorus, buy that grocery, get the faulty tube light fixed, cook dinner. I have not kept any help nor do I have any friends or family staying close to my place. I am on my own. And there is no one else to depend upon except myself. There, that is what is true independence, freedom from any external outside support.Freedom- You are you without anyone’s permission. No questions asked, none answered. You don’t have the drain and pressure of having constant, tedious duties to fulfill, and you never have to walk on eggshells around other people. Nobody around needs to be taken into account, you are all you have.Long lost hobbies- You have plenty of time when you stay alone. No amount of binge watching Netflix or sleeping can keep you preoccupied always. Lesser minds would deduce that’s why staying alone is meant to be boring. NO. You re-learn. Things you had discarded earlier comes back. For instance, I had always enjoyed mithila painting. The gruelling 5 year law course and an equally hectic professional life, made me forget how much I enjoyed doing it. These 3 years have brought it all back. True it took my months to turn the painting contemplation into an actual painting! But I did finally. Look at this:I wouldn't have ever reverted to painting unless I had the experience of living alone and thinking about what I wanted to do truly.New things- Re-learning suppressed hobbies aside, you actually put thought in new things. Why can’t this happen when NOT living alone you ask? Of course it can, but on your own, you constantly try to do things. Why? To do different things, try your hand at stuff you haven’t done before. For me, I learnt cooking! I knew how to cook a normal daal-chawal and survive on myself. But I actually wanted to cook good new food. Sample one of my finest white mushroom pasta.Not bad, eh!? Truth be told, even Quora happened to me coz I wanted to try a new forum for writing.Money management- This is the real deal. You might have heard staying alone is way more expensive than sharing accommodations. I was told that many times by my parents when I was moving into my flat. Stay with someone, your rent will be divided. Ghar ka saaman bi baant k lana hoga. This may or may not be true but I do know for a fact your money management skills will improve by leaps and bounds when you stay alone. Accountability for your own hard earned money comes naturally, you see.Travel- I had always loved travel. I was lazy and always broke so never went. Until recently. My New Year resolution since two years is to at least go to TWO new places every year. Trust me, travelling changes you. It’s not just cliche, travel works.There are so many more things I can add to this list, but it’s gonna be just too long. You learn patience, appreciate people more, build confidence internally, learn to be self-sufficient.But you know, at the end of the day everything eventually boils down to how are you as a person.When you come back home to pin drop silence, everyone gets to decide for themselves if that’s akin to loneliness or freedom.
What it is like to live alone?
Staying alone is a form of art, I try to make it beautiful each day. I think I have taken the concept of  living alone to the next level. It has been a bittersweet feeling until now. My case is similar to yours, however, I stay in not a city. I recently moved to a small town called Crailsheim, in the state of Baden Württemberg, Germany. Here is a photo of a stream running through the town:Isn't it just a pretty little town? I arrived here for my internship at P&G and had already been here once before for the same interview. I had seen this place back then, and was sure I was going to have  to put up with the feeling of being lonely. I am introverted to some extent and didn't really think it was much big a deal. So, why is it so extreme for me you ask? Several reasons:I hardly know the language to start a conversation, and not many here speak English.Winter was coming, and so you better stay the fuck indoors for most of your time unless you want to turn into a Popsicle. Non-existent nightlife, because it's a very small town and you hardly see anyone out after 7 pm.You don't see many young people and the average age seems to be above 40. I saw four spectacle shops on the main street that stretches for not more than 300 m, and there is just one main street. I'm not that great at making friends and like the company of only a few people. I like to stay by myself and mind my own business.Non-existent neighbors. At least they don't seem that friendly. Fortunately, I was to find a big, cozy and fully furnished room weeks before I arrived here. I had never stayed all by myself in a room of this size and so beautiful, I just fell in love with it. It had everything you can ask for to stay comfortably, here are a couple of photos:I have not yet switched on that TV, and I ain't kidding :/This is the view right through the window of my apartment:So initial few weeks I was pretty much excited to explore the town and make some new friends at my office. I did that, and then I didn't know what to do anymore. There was nothing much to look forward to during weekends. All my colleague friends (I was the only intern student at this time of the year) would go out of the city, travel during weekends. I would end up sulking in my room. Fortunately, I had many hobbies, and for the rest of the time I had to find a new routine to work with. It has turned to more like a regiment these days.   So, my advice for you is to invest time in yourself and goes like this:Live in an apartment that you feel like going back to at the end of your day. Let it be affordable, I would say somewhere around 15% of your income. Gives you enough room and doesn't make you feel claustrophobic. Make sure it's comfortable enough for you to practice your hobbies/ job.Spend time on your hobbies or whatever you are good at. However, keep it different this time. I am good at making realistic pencil drawings and have been making them for the past 3 years now (Here is my Quora answer showing my realistic drawings: Sachin R Kamath's answer to What are some examples of your own pencil drawings?). But here I tried to make it different and do something unconventional. I spend most of my time on weekends thinking of my new art work and a way to execute it flawlessly with the limited resources I have at my disposal. Here is what I sketched recently for Walt Disney's birthday:Workout. Trust me on this one, nothing feels better! It will help you keep yourself active and efficient through the day. Gets you good sleep at night. Keeps you fit. You start feeling more confident of yourself  and people will start noticing you. It makes you disciplined. There's an instant charm to your whole body and the way you live. I hit the gym thrice a week and I try to exercise in my room if I'm not able to. And you probably guessed it right, I workout alone most of the time as well. I usually arrive at the gym after 8 pm and there is hardly anyone else there at this time. So I wasn't joking when I said I have taken the art of being alone a notch higher. Learn to cook yourself a nice meal. I hate going to restaurants and paying unnecessarily when I can myself cook. This saves me a lot of money and keeps me involved during weekends. Cooking is easy and also interesting once you start experimenting according to your tastes. It also helps you in socializing. Just cook some of your traditional cuisines and invite your friends/ colleagues over. I did that in my first month here and got to know many colleagues from my office who have been the only reason I don't feel as much lonely here. They always invite me for weekend hangouts in the pub (Yes, there is just one good pub here, at least!). Here are few of my culinary skills I learnt over the past few months:I can't go about my weekend without cooking now, and I don't have to miss my home food anymore.Travel. Don't be afraid to travel solo. I always made it a point to travel at least once every month. Just a get away for the weekend, to cities nearby. Visiting some friends or making new ones. In the past 8 months of my stay in Germany, I have traveled to 7 different countries. So just get out there and plot the contours of your life on the map of the world. Cultivate a new hobby. When you got so much time at your disposal, why not learn something new? I always liked photography, and this was the right time for me to pursue it. It fit perfectly into my schedule, since I would travel often and all I had to do was grab my camera along with me. I have taken some amazing photos during my travels and it's also a good way to keep your parents happy while they are on the other side of the planet worrying about you. One of my favorite clicks is this one from Dubrovnik in Croatia, before I took a tumble into the pristine waters of the Adraitic sea myself:In fact, I'm so alone that sometimes I take pics of myself with my DSLR camera, since I hate selfies. Buy a bike. The first thing I bought after arriving in this town was a bike    ( not even groceries). It's one of the best investments to make. You save a lot of money on public transport, get to burn your calories, and also go on long bicycle rides during weekends. I travel to office to and fro on my bike everyday, a total of 11 km. I did an impromptu bike ride of 65 km once. Passing through tiny hills and bucolic pastures, and getting lost in the woods. It was very scary, 'Wrong Turn' level scary minus the hot chicks! How I managed it is an entirely different story you can read here Sachin R Kamath's answer to What is the craziest thing you have ever done? Buy a good set of speakers. If you like listening to music while you work/ cook, then you must invest in buying some good set of speakers. Music in my room is always playing and keeps me alert and ticking. The point is to stray away from the feeling of loneliness, it works. Also, some beer after a tiring day while subtly drifting away to the tune of Floyd is a feeling to have.Read. Yeah, I know. Same old. What every other Quoran so called 'avid reader' says. But I would like you to find a spot in your town where you can sit, read, and contemplate. Be it a cafe or a park. I recently found mine across a stream, facing the skyline of  15th century imperial buildings with the Rathhaus towering over them in the background. Also, lots of ducks quacking. That was the sweet part of being alone, the fancy part. The bitter part also does prevail but you live through it and move on. Because failure is not an option. Loneliness creeps through your skin, tries to get inside you and break you, but you must stay strong. Stay focused. How do you do that? You get to the sweet part mentioned above, keeping yourself busy and exploring the new. Oh, and yeah, sometimes I drink alone too. Isolation, It ain't for the faint-hearted. It's a form of art, so make it beautiful. All the best!
If someone asks me what’s the best decision I took in my life, undoubtedly I respond with“MOVING OUT TO LIVE BY MYSELF”Disclaimer: Time duration I mentioned below might be different in someone’s life who moved out to live by himself/herself. However, I hope there will be coincidence between our cases.I totally understand you might wonder what’s big deal in that ?, so let me briefly include about my life ( trust me it’s just a small paragraph hahahah)Till my grand ma died , in 2013 May and it was my 22nd year , she used to feed me while I was at home. In 2013 August, I moved to USA , and here it was my aunt. If there is anyone whom I like as much as I like my mother, she is my aunt. Till 2016 August (means my 25th year), I lived in their home and she used to cook lot of dishes , in fact most of the times she asks me whether I like the dish she is going to cook, so that I can eat it. She is such a beautiful lady. So , just assume a guy who never cooked or lived alone till first 25 years in his life and suddenly move out.Huh, Come on man, it’s not fun.This is how I felt since I moved out :Month 1: This is awesome, living by yourself, having your own privacy , doing what you want to do , this is just perfect state of life. You try to cook various dishes, fail sometimes, but you still feel good because you are learning something new.Month 2: Sometimes, things become hectic in life, you find no time to cook , so you opt to eat out. After a week or two you realize that you are way above your spending, consequently going short of money . This is where everything starts.Month 3: You feel lonely, you come home every evening /night after your work/classes, you realize you have no one to talk. You don’t know what to do. Sometimes you text to friends , who might not respond sometimes because of their own hectic schedule. Finally, you feel lonely. Right at this point, few people give up and go back to normal life by vacating the apartment/home. But, the real benefit will be seen by those who hang in there and try to get over from it.In the book David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell called these sort of difficulties as “Desirable Difficulties”During this stage, you will learn more about you and your thinking. You will come to know what plays crucial role in your life and whether you are keeping priorities in correct order. In short, you will learn about you .Month 4 and from then:You will start working on yourself,.You get habituated to new habits.You cook at home just to maintain finances.You wake up at time and get your things done, so that you have to push yourself to start your day.You keep things prioritized right from paying bills to cleaning home every two weeks.No surprise, if your pillow becomes your best friend ( if you know what I mean )You find time for yourself.You will learn how to prioritize things in your life, especially in finances.You will realize how worst you can cook and the fun part is you have to taste it because you cannot throw it out. Come on bud, it’s our hard work we cannot throw it out. hahahahahahaPersonally, after experiencing this , I believe “LIVING BY YOURSELF” at least for an year or two should be experienced by everyone in his/her own life.The seed you sow to live by yourself, will reap with great benefits for you.Good Luck-Karthik Achanta

What is it like to get married and live alone?
Getting married can be wonderful and frightening.This is especially true if your spouse is in the military. Deployment is where your spouse is sent to another duty station. You are left behind because there usually isn’t housing available for the spouse. The frightening part is if they are in a hot zone (fighting going on) and you have to rely on the members of their unit to watch their back.You will probably need to find something to do with your time. A lot of the wives/husbands find jobs or go to school or both. You can do crafts and all sorts of things.Make your home a welcoming place.

Did you regret getting married immediately after the ceremony?
My first marriage lasted 89 days.That’s slightly longer than a Kardashian marriage, but still not terrific.Jokes aside, it’s not that I am flippant about marriage. I waited until I was almost 30, with a guy I’d known and worked with for several years. He seemed to be a kind, successful, respectable person, and public figure within our community. I felt lucky to have snagged him. I asked him all the “right” questions, trying to uncover any possible stumbling blocks: religion, children, fighting “style”, life goals, debt levels, sexuality… you name it, we covered it.I didn’t expect that everything he told me would be a lie. Damn, I still can’t get over how good he was at lying. I’ve never encountered anything like it. But there were few to no warning signs that he was a terrible person until the week of the wedding. When people and worlds start colliding at an event like a wedding, it can become difficult to suppress the truth.The wedding day was a hot mess. Everything was a sign that I needed to run, but I was bull-headed and determined to go get my way. I didn’t pay attention.For starters, I had to buy a dress on my wedding day. Not kidding. My dressmaker failed to complete the gown I’d been fitted for in the months prior. She showed up with a half-sewn, un-pressed gown the day before. My parents scrambled to find me a time for fitting at David’s the day of my wedding. I purchased the third gown I tried on, and it was actually really lovely. That’s beside the point.As we arrived at the ceremony, things felt very strange. Our families were standing on different sides of the gallery, not speaking. I went to my room to get ready. I can’t describe it as well as I want to, but something was “off.” My father, as he walked me down the aisle, gestured toward the door and said to me, “I don’t know why I’m saying this, but I need you to know that if you want to walk away from this, if something feels wrong, I have my car pulled up and I’ll deal with the fallout.” He’d never mentioned being against my ex previously. I shrugged it off, but holy shit.So we got married. And that’s when immediately, the kind, gentle, loving man I had been engaged to became a total POS.His best friend and our best man showed up—a person he previously claimed was straight, but clearly was both gay and in love with my ex. He gave a toast that made 120+ guests cringe. It was all about how in love he is with my ex, how he’ll never forget the first time they laid eyes on each other, and how he’ll be there for him when our relationship inevitably ends. (Spoiler alert! I found out later they banged before we met. Bet you didn’t see that coming!)We danced our first dance. He didn’t like the way I was dancing, so he whispered frustrated coaching remarks in my ear the entire time.His parents, people who had until this moment embraced me with love, refused to give us a toast and sent his brother instead. It’s as though they knew what I was getting into.Later that night, I walked out in my ridiculously hot new lingere. He couldn’t perform. But he was really excited to order 10,000 calories worth of room service and pass out.My mother’s pearl earrings that she let me borrow were stolen from our hotel room that night.See? Hot mess. Of course I had the thought “what have I done!?”And it only devolved further over the next 88 days. I found out he hadn’t filed taxes in 5+ years. My bank account that I put his name on started getting routinely raided for funds by the IRS. He became verbally abusive and controlling. His many other lovers (at least SIX of whom were on the guest list to our wedding) started coming out of the woodwork. And so, so so much more than I could convey in this post. It’s humiliating…still. But, the silver lining is that it’s over. I had his things removed while he was out of town and never spoke to him directly again, despite him making threats to me through our contacts and lawyers.I am remarried with kids now, and forever grateful for the life I live today.I’m anonymous because years later, in some way, I still sort of fear him and how he might retaliate if he knew I was telling people the truth.
Do you regret your marriage, and why?
Has anyone who is an Indian regretted getting married immediately after the ceremony?
Are you happy with your life after getting married?
Have you ever witnessed an objection at a wedding?
Have you regretted not being intimate before getting married?
Yes, immediately the same night. I am a well educated, good looking girl from an upper middle class society in a tier 2 city who got into an arranged marriage as love did not happen till my late twenties. The grooms family were relatives of my father’s friend , so we did not get into a proper bgc. The guy was a single child of his parents, they were well educated and well off, they showed a very liberal picture and pretended to be very affectionate. Soon after the ceremony, it was the boys birthday the next day, so I had ordered a cake (worth rs 500) in the same hotel where my wedding took place, the guys family denied to taste it or pay for it as I had not taken permission from my then mother in law. My father cleared all bills of the wedding including their stay, food , even the cake.I learnt my husband gives his entire salary to his mother and even his credit card messages go to his mothers mobile. He never paid for any of my petty expenses. Since I had entered the marriage, I wanted to be positive and not mind their stingy attitude ( I had done my MBA from XLRI and was earning well before marriage, had to quit my job to relocate with my husband and in laws), I thought I will anyway join somewhere and fulfill my own needs. I never expected any financial help from him anyway.Right after marriage to my surprise I was asked to stay in a room with a single cot and cupboard which my husband was using, so I used to sleep on the floor and live out of my bag as my in laws did not have time to do up the house. Even though I had money and I really needed proper furniture, the mother in law had to find time to approve the furniture which never happened. She used to plan the days for her son, even though I had quit my job and had planned a gap before joining the next job , I could never spend a day with my husband.My mother in law was always around my husband and would never allow us personal space as she was too possessive about him. She even cut short our already short honeymoon pretending she was unwell.Thankfully I had secured a new job within the first month of marriage in the new city. Initially I faced indirect remarks regarding them having to bear my food and recidential expenses (it was their own house, not rented) , I suggested to share the expenses but they wanted my entire salary to be transferred to my mother in law. This was the first thing I objected as I had been financially independent for 7 years and this step would have made me dependent on the mother in law even for the smallest decisions just like her son was.The household help was asked to leave and I was expected to take care of all the chores as ‘I was the woman of the house’ . But I had no rights. I had not managed these things before which was clearly communicated to them prior to marriage and they were fine with it then, but post marriage, they were constantly pointing mistakes, passed sarcastic remarks, used to taunt and sometimes humiliate in front of guests for minor mistakes in cooking/serving food etc. I used to cook dinner inspite of being tired from work and all the traveling. At times they would ask me to make some desert after dinner , at times they would keep my food aside and order in even before tasting the food saying they were not fond of the dish.The guy used to regularly check my phone, I never doubted his actions and had nothing to hide, he shared my location without my knowledge with his mother and himself. They used to question even when I spoke with my own family. They asked me to cut my roots to be able to grow new roots there. Due to the constant pressure in all directions at my in laws place it was impossible for me to maintain any contact with any of my friends, I used to immediately rush home after work, even tried Mumbai local trains to reach faster, being an outsider it’s difficult.I started getting very depressed as I failed to understand why these people were so unfair to me inspite of me trying so hard to meet their expectations. The mother and son used to hold secret meetings behind locked doors , within a family, this was strange for me. Finally they put immense pressure on me to quit my job on the pretext of not managing the household work well. I resisted as that was my only respite from the suffocating environment where you need permission from the mother in law to even breathe.My husband and his mother used to do everything together, even did not allow anyone else besides each other in car or the dining table, they were codependent partners. The only person my husband cared about was his mother, not even his father who was too old and financially dependent on his wife. They just needed a puppet for a daughter in law who would be completely dependent on them for all her needs and carry out their orders. I was not taken to a doctor even one time I was running 104 fever and left to recover naturally.All this happened within 2 months of marriage. Though I had not informed any of this to my parents as even I could not understand anything clearly and they would have been tensed. But my in laws called them to Mumbai to talk to them and pressurize me to quit my job. They expected being from a small town they would agree to anything to save the marriage. My father being very progressive and supportive immediately took me out of their house and was decided on ending such a marriage as he did not trust their intentions anymore. My in laws kept all my Jewellery, clothes, cosmetics etc but that was our least concern. They used to scheme and lie at the drop of a hat. I took few months to come out of the shock and filed for a divorce, it took 1.5 years and lot of mud fight to end a 2 month long marriage. I still face the social stigma as a divorcee but at least I breathe free air, laugh , talk , travel like before. Have my family and close friends with me. I feel fortunate to have come out of that hell so fast.Now moral of the storyPlease please please try to spend enough time, judge a person, don’t ignore alarm bells before marriage, better safe then sorry. Don’t ever give in to societal pressure because of biological clock ticking, no one really cares afterwards.Know that extremely greedy and selfish people do exist , they will never treat you as a family but as a commodity. Stay away from mamas boys , read about the mama’s Boy’s syndrome, Oedipus complex . You will be reduced to a third fiddle in your own relationship.You can not build a foundation of a relationship on manipulation, mistrust, lies, scheming, torture etc. It defeats the very purpose of a love relationship which is supposed to nurture you and help you grow as a human being.If still you get caught in an abusive relationship, run fast in the opposite direction and save your life. DO NOT linger on false hopes, people don’t change much post their 30s. Don’t worry too much about society, not more than your life and freedom to breathe.EDIT : The reason I shared all these incidents in such details is even If it helps a single girl recognize such people before getting into such an arrangement or inspires anyone come out of such an abusive relationship, I will feel much better, more than taking revenge which many of you have suggested in your comments. Question that many have asked- Reason I didn’t file for a DV(though initially I had a lot of anger) is it would have further aggravated the situation, given the Indian legal system, what took me 1.5 years because the guys side agreed for mutual consent divorce during counseling itself(I had filled for an annulment) would have taken me lot many years to prove as mental harassment cases are not easy to prove. When in a family, you don’t record conversations apprehending a divorce. After consulting a good divorce lawyer, I took a guided step. My only aim was to be free of that relationship as soon as possible- legally and mentally, plus you can’t really beat shrewd people in their own game, it is more draining for you then for them.As far as their next victim is concerned, I am sure that they won’t get the guy married as their purpose was to silence the society when it asked why they were not getting the guy marriage till a late age, that is achieved. As some of you have already guessed, the mother and the son were in an unhealthy relationship, I have bumped into situations which point to that, don’t know till what extent their partnership was, I did not mention this part earlier as I did not want to take the discussion there - it’s very difficult to know unless you stay with such people, but yes I have mentioned indicators and symptoms of knowing these before getting into it now that I know. They had even preplanned my divorce if I did not agree to their terms, reason I say it is they had insisted for the ‘special marriage act’ instead of ‘Hindu marriage act’ during marriage registration even though both were hindus(The former act restricts the alimony rights of the women only to the guy’s property not his parents- we found out later). Also now they know their other intention of getting a docile maid to slog, stay in a corner and pay for their luxuries can never be fulfilled. People may be fooled once but not for a lifetime.The other query was how to recognize a Mama's boy - while I am not an expert and there are lot many articles on the internet, some sure shot cues from my experience are 1) financial dependence 2) Can’t take decisions big or small without consulting mother 3) Mention her in almost all conversations, unusually large number of times. 4) his preferences match with hers almost in everything, again that points that he doesn’t have an independent thought process and has to please his mom compulsively 5) these families remain socially isolated and are secretive in nature. 6) Mom praises him for everything big or small, right or wrong, he needs that validation, when you show him the mirror, he doesn’t like it, shows passive aggressive behavior. Further, you can talk to a psychologist or read on the internet for more behavioral symptoms.That brings me to the next one - why I did not find out in the courtship period. I did have a courtship of about 5 months, but we were in different cities. His father had just undergone a bypass surgery before we met for the first time, so he could not travel to meet me , I travelled couple of times but never met him without his family (except for a lunch). Even phone conversations were around his fathers health and wedding preparations. Lets just say we were easy believers and had never seen such people in life, and they were good actors, so it was a easy for them to fool us.And finally the last question why did I tolerate their nonsense for that long. Well, when you have entered into a relationship commitment, you need to give it a chance, benefit of doubt, reflect on your own actions, try for improving yourself and the environment, try to communicate. I did all of this for those 2 months. When I saw all this was falling into deaf ears and I was being perceived as an idiot and a push over for putting up with everything, their expectations from me kept increasing, I took an action. We should be flexible, but know our saturation level, how far we are getting stretched and act before reaching our breaking point.Hope that answers all your questions. Many thanks for extending your love, support and good wishes. Take care.
I did, because I wasn’t a ‘virgin’.Imagine being intimate with your husband on the first night, for the first time ever. He's constantly looking down to check something rather than in your eyes. Then sighs deeply, thrusts a couple of times to finish, and immediately runs out of the room.He did return after a couple of minutes, visibly trying hard to control his anger.Him : "You're a used disgusting woman who has spoiled my life."Me : "What?"Him : "You're not a virgin. I couldn't see any blood. You're a cheat."Me : "What the fuuuuuuuu.."That was the first conversation I had as a newly wedded girl minutes after I lost my super duper precious virginity with my 'perfect' husband, handpicked by my parents.First night, and I was made to feel first like a prostitute, then like a cheat, and finally like damaged commodity. It was like his world came crashing down. I tried to actually give him basic 10th standard level sex education. That some girls don't have hymens and sometimes it just breaks from normal physical activities. But no. For him, it was like 'seal broken, product faulty'. Too bad we don't live in a tribe where a bride's virginity is a topic of open discussion the next morning. All my poor husband could do was huff and puff and act irate. The whole family was concerned how he went from being super excited to super irate in one night. They asked me, but how could I say their ideal son was only excited about uncorking his new trophy, not be wedded & start sharing a life with a girl. This went on for 2 whole months. Not even eye contact with me for compassion, but only interaction was arguments. Actually, we did have sex once during that time. I think he just couldn't control his excitement to a female body lying vulnerably on his bed. It had nothing to do with me because he didn't look at my face or talk to me before, during or after. I had gone along with it because I thought finally my efforts are paying off and he is normal now. Too bad.I had to literally have him verify the little hymen factoid with 3 gynaecologist. One of them even scolded my husband. Not only he had no trust in a girl he was already married to and it wasn’t even about a perceived ‘lie’ about my sexual history, he actually had the attitude of a cheated commodity owner. I was so disgusted. Am I no more than an iPhone that can be jailbreaked? Even if I wasn't a virgin I would have owned up to it & still not let him objectify me! After 2 months I finally lost it & yelled at him to go hire a detective to dig up my past if he doesn't trust my word. That's when he let it go. At least in front of me, I won't be surprised if he has actually hired one. But by now the damage has been done. I now know how he perceives our intimate moments. They are not 'bonding experiences' to him as they are to me but as achievements or rewards, no matter what he says now. (Which isn't much. He just chants 'I’m sorry, give me another chance' like a whiny baby.) I has been 6 months to our marriage now.There are so many other problems, like how I can't even buy a coffee mug without my father-in-law's approval. How his mother shares such a codepedent bond with her son and just won't let go. It's like we aren't a couple, but I'm the third wheel in their relationship. It is suffocating our already damaged relationship. But if my husband can't see that, even I don't have the energy & inclination. How there is no privacy and all the women are always scouting my belongings, how they have dumped all the household chore on me since the first week like I'm an unpaid maid.Honestly, if I wasn't for the 'what will people say' phenomenon, I would have filed for a divorce. My parents keep telling me to adjust because unless he's hitting me regularly, there's no reason.Either this relationship will kill me, or I will kill it. Since the latter isn't happening, the former will.
Woah! I’m not alone. I used to wonder, why me? But then I realized that shit happens.To start with, I’m a north indian guy. My parents started looking for a prospective bride three years back. I’m reasonably built, just above average looking ( a little exaggeration) guy with typical engineeering graduation. My expectations of a bride was simple and clear, just like anybody else, I wanted an urban educated (I’ll get back on this), decent/good looking girl who shares my values. Pretty simple, isn’t it? That’s what everybody wants. Well, ideally.My parents are orthodox but I have lived with them all my life, so I took this fact very lightly. As soon as the search began, my parents went to our native for an indefinite vacation. I looked after the family business and was doing reasonably well. Now, proposals started flowing in and I rejected all of them as none were suitable. In my case, the proposals were consistent at one fact- every girl I denied, the next one was getting worse. That’s primarily because all proposals were from my native place - less educated, less decent looking, let alone sharing my values. I couldn’t get a single proposal which could at the least satisfy the first two requirements. Anyhow, I never lost hope. I was waiting for the perfect match. As a typical indian guy, I confined myself to ‘arranged’ marriage because of parental and societal pressure. No matter how much you earn, how forward thinking you are, you always fall for this trap.One day, my parents sent me a proposal on WhatsApp and the moment I recieved it, I immediately turned it down-politely. I did not have the voice to sound rude to them. Now, my parents had other plans. They said that I didn’t like it because she wrapped herself up in Sari and she was not photogenic. I told them otherwise. But they didn’t budge. They told me to get down to my native a see her in person. I denied. They played tricks on me and somehow got me down to native. Now, they told me that they have other 3–4 proposals in hand and wanted me to see them in person. I visited them and couldn’t imagine my life with anyone. I rejected all of them. When I had to return back, they told me that a meeting has already been arranged to see a girl and I don’t really have to say yes. I reluctantly agreed. And, here we are, meeting the girl I denied.Now the real twist in the story starts. I did not like the girl in person as well. But my dear ones (excluding my parents), whom I trust blindly fell blind and told me to say yes. I was shocked. I shrugged and said that we take this discussion back home. We left. After reaching home, I asked a few dear ones and they told me to accept the proposal. I fell prey to the emotions and reluctantly agreed. Immediately upon my agreement, my parents started the marriage process. They informed the bride’s parents, paid customary visits, discussed other topics etc. Marriage was fixed six months from then. I was not happy at all. I came back home and strongly disagreed, but my dear ones convinced me otherwise. I did not talk to the girl and strongly advocated against it to send them a message. The bride’s parents were ignorant about it.Months were passing by, I couldn’t believe that I was getting married. I was clearly not happy about it. In fact, I was depressed but never showed it on my face hoping for the best. I hoped that I may have been making the right move. I never informed any of my friend of my marriage. No enthusiasm. None.All wedding shopping started. All relatives gathered and I’m still hoping for the best. No sign of happiness. Atlast, the D day arrived. I wasn’t happy with any of the marriage arrangements, but who cares? It was my parent’s son’s wedding that I attending, not mine. Marriage completed. The girl arrives at my home. I can subtly felt the vibes from my neighbours, family friends, relatives. They weren’t quite excited. But who gives a fcuk?First day into marriage, after we were done with post marriage rituals, I felt there was no spark of first night in me (mind you- I’m highly sexually active). Nevertheless, I thought to myself- let’s make this work. As soon as I entered in the room, I made my first move, I held her hand and sat down. I offered her to get rid of all jewels and makeup and feel at ease. She agreed. I told her that I didn’t want to rush things up and that we get to know each other before we could get intimate. She agreed. A few more formality questions and she agreed. We slept that night - strangers to each other. Now things started to prick me- the way she spoke, the way she behaved, the way she was. Nothing wrong for her and everybody around me but everything wrong for me. Next Morning, I realized that I have made a blunder, that she is not the one I can live the next 50 years of my life, that she is not the one I’m willing to see as my child’s mother.Second day into my marriage and all the negative thoughts gush into my mind and heart. I did not want to live with her. The girl had no fault. She would make a good wife of herself, but not to me. Suddenly, I didn’t want to live in my own house. I wanted to leave.There’s a saying - If you don’t like someone in the first sight, you will never like them in the eternity. This was the issue in my case. She was not to blame. It was my fault to have entered into this marriage. She was just as blind and unaware as I was. We returned back to home. I did not speak to my parents and to that girl at first. But later I cleared the air that I have made a mistake and that this girl was not suitable life partner to me. Since then, there has always been tense moments in my home.To cut long story short, she lived with us for roughly three months and has gone to her parent’s home for a vacation. Their parents have also come to know about this situation. I have not contacted her or them and have not let them contact me. My parents believe that all these are my stars’ doing and not mine and they are living in hope that things will settle in the next year.Now, I’m stuck in this marriage and waiting to end. I have decided that no matter what, I’m not going to accept that girl as my partner and I hope that the girl understands this at the earliest.Any suggestions/advices are welcome. Criticisms are also welcome as I know that I am the one to be blamed and no one else.
Have you ever witnessed an objection at a wedding?
Have you regretted not being intimate before getting married?
How many of you regretted the decision to get married a few years after you got married?
What happens after you get married? After the ceremony, what did you all do?
Have you ever regretted never marrying?
As many others before me have said, if something niggles at you about the person, you should listen to it.I am from India and it was an arranged marriage. When my parents discussed about marriage with me, I told them that I would go by their decision as long as the guy is able to converse in English. Though my mother tongue is Kannada, I was more comfortable in English and we spoke English at home except for my mom. Everyone in my extended family spoke in English.So when this guy came, though he knew English, he was not very comfortable with it. And everyone in my family scolded me for having such a stupid criteria.In hindsight, I should have put my foot down. Anyway, my to-be-MIL wouldnt let us meet before the wedding, which we all thought was weird. She was like talk to me, but dont talk to my son. First Flag.So after our wedding, when I first went to their house after a few days (because of other ceremonies being held at the bride’s house), my husband planned the honeymoon at that time. So during the day, he made a plan to go to Ooty. He didnt even book the bus tickets. We went to the bus stand and bought tickets to the next bus going to Ooty.I had never done that. My dad was a planner and would have planned everything months in advance. So we really didnt have much to talk to each other. But our trip was ok, not luxury but comfortable. Of course, he made me spend for the entire trip.It was only after we came back, his father scolded him for letting me spend. But he didnt regret it. He is like her father gave her the money for the trip, so I asked her to spend.Silly stuff like they wanted my dad to buy a bed because they wanted to show their neighbour what my dad could provide for his daughter. The day my husband saw our daughter for the first time (No, he was not around for her birth), he said now you can not leave me. My dad touched his feet and said he was sorry though there was nothing he said or did to insult my husband and his family.His mom was crazy. After breakfast, she would clean the whole house, all windows, doors, etc, including the garage everyday. This would literally take up the whole day and it would be 5 or 6 in the evening by the time, we were done with the cleaning. In addition, I would have to make lunch and dinner. I had no idea how, so she would scream out instructions and I would make. His sisters once asked what my dad would have done if they had asked for dowry, I said he would have refused. How I wish they had asked for it, instead of asking after the marriage. Everytime, my dad visited me, he gave me some spending money. I had no money and I was not allowed to even think of working though I was an MBA.Anyway, long story short, this state of affairs continued for couple of years and then one day, I called a cab, took my 8 month old daughter and walked out of their house to never return. And before divorce proceedings could start, he passed away but not before he married again while being married to me and getting his second wife pregnant. My In-Laws kicked his second wife out of the house before my husband was even cremated.
My mom told me she realized on the honeymoon what a disastrous mistake she had made marrying my father. Apparently after a year and a half of being charming, loving, etc, he turned into a complete douchebag. Started (continued, probably, just not in secret) smoking pot, drinking heavily, refusing to work. She was close to his family and her own were all dead or estranged, so she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt at first. Left him once after my older brother was born but he pleaded and begged and said he would change. He didn't. By the time she had decided she wanted to leave for good, she was pregnant with me.Epilogue: Because she's tough as nails and very smart, she stuck it out until I was 13 (the age at which children of divorcing parents in Georgia can choose whom to live with), then bailed. Today she has a PhD in educational leadership and heads up a string of schools in Dubai making an extremely healthy six figures. She's my hero for every reason a mother could be and I'm so proud of her I could burst.
I did…24 years ago. My husband was more a best friend than a lover, but having had my heart broken by a passionate, cheating lover the previous spring I thought, “Well, Paul will never cheat. He's a good guy, and we agree on politics, religion, money, goals, etc. This one I should marry.” It didn't occur to me that the limited nature of our physical relationship wasn't strictly as a result of his religious upbringing.Imagine my surprise when on my 4 day honeymoon, we had sex twice…That was UNTIL I allowed him to take explicit pictures of me in my lingerie. After we had them developed at a 1-hr Photomat (anyone remember those?)? In the last day on our honeymoon, we had intercourse 3 times. Each time, however? He'd take time to look at those pictures before he crawled into bed…it should have set off alarm bells, “Abort! Abort! Get an annulment!“ but it didn't. I just vaguely sensed that something was really odd…So, fast forward a couple weeks. We're moving in together and I notice 3 LARGE boxes off in the corner of what was to be our “spare" bedroom. They were FILLED with VHS tapes of every type of porn imaginable (Some things? I'd never even heard of!).I confronted him, but he refused to get rid of them. I kept on and threatened to get a lawyer (we hadn't had sex since the honeymoon). He agreed to get rid of the tapes…and did. I did, however concede to let him keep about a half dozen of his “favorites" (my mistake) that we could “watch together.”I was foolish enough to think the problem was solved. We did watch “together," but I quickly realized, he wasn't focusing on me.In short, Paul has been severely addicted to porn (using multiple times/day) and has REFUSED and/or been UNABLE to have sexual relations with me (w/o porn present) for over 20 years.My two children were both conceived through combined use of alcohol and porn. It's the only thing that worked...It aches to think about the years I’ve spent alone and lonely in my marriage. It horrifies me to realize I was willing to debase myself in bed with a man who would only have sex with me if I allowed him to view porn before (or his preference, during) intercourse. When I gave in? His eyes never once left the screen. It wasn't me he was pinning down or bending over. I was just... a convenient... prop.It also sickens me to think of all the times I chose food in the middle of the night, or laid there trying to stifle my tears so no one would hear, rather than giving vent to and dealing with my true feelings.I’ve loved him and worked hard to be "a good wife" for him. I kept upgrading my appearance (until I started using food to cope), I cooked gourmet meals on a budget, handled the books, housework and laundry. I always made sure to look good when he came home from work. He never noticed.When I look back at old pictures, I am amazed. Objectively speaking, I really was pretty. (Or attractive, shapely, cute, wild, enticing, hot, beautiful... it depends on who you asked). But whatever the adjective, I knew I was a woman men appreciated and desired.And I was naive enough to believe sex wasn't going to be THAT important once a couple got married... I married my friend because he was everything my previous boyfriend was not. And THAT was a mistake. Yet, without him? My children wouldn't be who they are, so I can't completely "wish things away."That girl was pretty, smart, funny, and sexy, but she got misplaced somewhere along the way.Parts of our marriage have been good, some even great, but this one very important area feels shattered beyond repair. While some may disagree, I consider sexual expression a need, not merely a want. Like Paul said to me, "Something's broken inside." And he's right. But the brokeness is in me every bit as much as it is in him.Paul and I are friends, we finish each other's sentences, compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses, we laugh at similar things, read some of the same books, we have great kids, and we've never differed on how to raise them. We have history. We have everything... except the one thing that makes me feel the most alive, human, and feminine.I ache to once again experience the thrill of watching a man respond and eventually lose his self control and give himself to me. That moment, watching ectasy bloom on the face of a lover is the most thrilling, evocative, beautiful, powerful rush I've ever known.This is me today:The more I think about it, the more enticing an FWB (Friend With Benefits) sounds.
Yes.Not after the ceremony but even before it. Actually things happened so fast that it was out of control even before I could gather what has hit me. It was an arranged setup and hence I gave benefit of doubt to the girl who acted like someone who understood me and what I wanted as a married person. Oh boy, can’t tell how wrong was I.Our relationship lasted for around 2 months or so and I’ve never been happier taking that final call of ending it. My analysis of the whole situation is that the girl had some psychological issues which isn’t very apparent, but when you actually live with her, you realize that something is amiss (and it was a big deal as it popped up in even very minute aspects of daily life). Very short courtship period ensured that I was fooled into the entire thing quite conveniently. Add family pressure to the situation and everything for me went for a toss.Many lessons learnt in the process.Do not haste into marriage.If you’re not sure even for that 0.1%, halt everything, stop right there and rethink the entire situation.Gut feeling is the most important feeling for any person. It never lies and is barely wrong in crucial scenarios like this.Do not believe your relatives by the word. Worst creatures on the planet. Only trying to meet their ends (evil or good)
Going anonymous as my husband is on Quora.Few years into the marriage and we are still struggling to find our spot of peace. We are on a break currently due to our differences.Background: Ours was a love marriage. We belong to different states and cultural backgrounds in India. In my part of India, women are very emancipated and treated equal as men. He comes from a place where the primary duty/talent of a woman is to be a good cook. Dowry is looked down upon at my place whereas as his it is a matter of pride to show off. In short there are a lot of cultural/social differences between our families. We were in love. Few problems I could not anticipate in that heady feeling of love, several others I was not informed about by my fiancee then.A week before the wedding I was having a very uneasy feeling about everything happening around me. I started getting bouts of dizziness. Had a low hemoglobin count and had to take medications. I could not sleep and had to coax my father to give me a sleeping pill every single night.During the wedding cermonies, I came to know that the families have had a string of fights regarding customs and arrangements. When I was at the mandap, I heard my father-in-law call my folks a bunch of tribals. My heart sunk.The evening was panning out to be a horrible precursor to what was follow. Married life was never smooth. The sister in laws always carried a vendetta against me for whatever happened that day. I was expected to be good at cooking/cleaning from the word go. There is no domestic help either and I was expected to do everything. Nobody considered the fact that I was studying and working away from home most part of my adult life and I was not a mere stay at home kind of girl. My husband sadly did not do enough for me. His silence encouraged the sils even more. Apart from that there was a constant financial expection from both of us. They even expected me to contribute my salary for their expences. They say you can conquer all differences with love but sadly the love was not enough for us.I have returned to my parents to nurse my bruised soul. I might or might not return to our home. I believe all my misgivings during my marriage was my intuition warning me of the disaster ahead.My regret is that I should have loved him enough to overcome all cultural/ideological differences. Loved so much that I would have lost my identity and beliefs. Or I should have known enough about his family to take a more informed decision about him.P.S. Relatively new to Quora. So please pardon the slights in the flow of story telling :)

1 – Figure Out What Makes You Truly HappyIf you have recently gotten out of a relationship, or are simply not currently interested in anyone, then try not to look at this stage in your life as a negative thing. Being single gives you a wonderful opportunity to figure out what truly makes you happy and gives you the perfect chance to get to know yourself better.Being single grants you the time and freedom to do whatever you want on your own schedule and allows you to put your needs, desires, and ambitions above all others.Not being in a relationship will help you realize and understand that your happiness does not have to depend on someone else’s presence. You need to be able to be happy alone first, and love yourself in order to give your love to someone else and have a successful relationship.If you don’t know what is going to make you happy, how can you expect someone else to? You need to know and experience what real love and happiness is like by yourself before you commit to loving someone else.It might be scary at first but here are some ideas that can help you to feel more positive about being alone.Get to know yourself by spending some time alone in solitude. Do something that will help you relax and focus on your mind, body and soul. Go shopping, take a bath, listen to some new music, have a glass of wine, watch a marathon of your favorite show and don’t feel guilty about treating yourself or making yourself a top priority.Habit #2 – Give Yourself a Fresh StartSometimes we get stuck in monotonous schedules and our days feel like they merge together into a week that’s exactly the same as the last. Maybe you have forgotten what it’s like to feel happy because you simply aren’t stimulated with what’s happening in your life. Perhaps it’s time to write a list of all the fun things and activities that make you smile.Write down new places you would like to explore, games you would like to learn how to play, or books you would like to read. Once you start making this list, you will look forward to trying these new things and you will start to get excited about the possibilities available to you.Sometimes all it takes to feel refreshed and happy is to change something simple out of your daily routine. Maybe it’s time to rearrange your furniture or redecorate your house.By changing something in your surroundings, it will help you start fresh and prevent you from feeling like your life is stagnant. You can also look at moving, rearranging or redecorating your house to create an instant fresh start or renewal of your current stage in life.Plan a cleaning or de-cluttering session. Get rid of things that are collecting dust or that you have been hanging on to because you’ll feel guilty if you throw them out. Remember that it’s time to start living for you and no one else. Only keep things that make you happy, are important, useful and meaningful to you.Habit #3 – Practice Self-LoveSelf-love is a state of appreciation for oneself that grows from actions that support our physical, psychological and spiritual growth. [source] When you stop thinking about how other people can make you happy and practice self-love, you will soon realize what it feels like to be happy alone and be able to learn to love and accept yourself from the inside out.Here are some ways you can practice self-love:Stop putting so much value on what others think and stop striving for perfection. Everyone has their flaws whether they tell you or not. Once you have accepted that being alone is normal and natural, you will begin to realize that it’s okay and be perfectly happy while alone.Alone time will allow you to be mindful of your thoughts and surroundings. You will be able to feel happiness and peace and know that you have absolutely everything inside of yourself that you need to be completely fulfilled. You do not need to expect anything from anyone else.A great way to practice self-love includes writing down things that you love about yourself. Focus on the positives; you are healthy, unique and have great hair, wonderful personality,nice legs, beautiful eyes, or whatever you decide.You can also practice self-love by being aware of your negative thoughts. If you are constantly thinking with a dark cloud overhead then you will never leave room to let the sunshine through. There is a positive side and a negative side to almost any situation. Train your mind to think of the positive outcome and, over time, this will start to happen naturally.Another way to get out of the negative thought clouds is to surround yourself with positive things and people. If you are at a low point, you might not even want to get off of the couch and reach for the phone but it’s important to get out of the house and be around friends and family who love you and who will help you take your mind off of whatever it is that’s bringing you down.If you tend to avoid the phone or make plans, then try committing to something up front. If you commit to something, then you will be less likely to back out when the time comes to actually do it.Here’s an example: Pre-pay for a 10-week kickboxing class or sports league. Once you have made that up front long-term commitment, it will be much harder for you to say no to these plans, even when you are having a bad day.Habit #4 – Exercise and Build a Healthy LifestyleMaybe it’s time to reconnect with yourself on a physical level. Start a new exercise program that will help you get into shape, feel good about your body, and even reap the numerous benefits of endorphins.Working out shouldn’t always seem like a chore, there are some great programs like spinning, zumba, or even Xbox games that will allow you workout with others in a fun way. If you commit to joining a class and have a friend that signs up with you, you will be less likely to quit and you will have double the fun while you workout.If you do not wish to make a big commitment, then start out small and check out some different types of workouts in free workout tutorials on YouTube to see which ones fit you best. Make these new exercises a part of your morning routine so it will keep you refreshed during the day. The best part about morning workouts is that you won’t be thinking about having to workout for the rest of the day because it’s already done!If you have a dog, you should have no problem going for a daily 20-minute walk or run. Your dog will love you for it and will help keep you committed by reminding you that it’s time for your daily walk; how can you say no to those cute little puppy eyes?What’s eating you; or more like, what are you eating? Sometimes our diet can affect our happiness and bring our mood down. Take a look at what you have been eating, and look for healthier alternatives. A great way to do this is to use an app or diary for one week and write down everything that you have consumed. You might be surprised at just how much unhealthy food you are eating and when you review your journal at the end of the week, you will be able to see where there’s room for improvement in your diet.In addition to the quality of the food we eat, the quantity of the food we eat can also effect our moods and happiness. Often people turn to food when they begin to feel sad and depressed. Eating can give some quick relief but it is always followed by self-recriminations if you eat too much. Not only that but consuming large amounts of food can lead to lethargy. Simply by controlling portion sizes of the food we eat, we not only help to keep ourselves healthier, but also happier.Sleep is also extremely important in order to keep you energized throughout the day and it even has the added benefits of helping you lose weight and keeping a healthy lifestyle, mind, and heart. [Creating good sleep habits] Go to bed early and sleep in once in a while, but make sure you find a balanced schedule. One of the best benefits of being alone is that you can take up the whole bed without getting kicked or nudged in your sleep!Habit #5 – Find Your Passion and Cultivate ItIs there something you’ve always wanted to do but keep putting it off? What’s wrong with trying it now? When you’re alone, you no longer have to consider other people’s plans. Choose to do something different that will be a challenge for you. It doesn’t matter what it is. It just needs to be something that you’re passionate about.If you love animals, why not volunteer once a week to help out your local shelter? If you’re stuck on ideas, then there are many fun websites that can help you out with this decision; local dance classes, art classes, photography classes, acting lessons, cooking classes, day trips, guitar lessons you name it, you can find it in your area.Sometimes we don’t truly find our passion in life until we have tried and experienced many different things. You should keep in mind that there is never any harm in trying something new and experiencing something new can actually be quite fun. It will get you out of the house, allow you to be around new and positive people and help you renew your confidence for learning new things.Habit #6 – Step Out of Your Comfort ZoneTry doing things that you’ve never done before. Try not to have your guard up and be open to all possibilities; you don’t know that you won’t like something until you’ve tried it.A great way to step out of your comfort zone is to go somewhere and do something new and fun each week.Another great thing about being alone is that no one is there to say no or disagree with your plans.When you start experiencing new things, places and events, you will probably be meeting new people and make some new friends. This may seem difficult at first if you are shy but putting yourself in other people’s shoes might help. Remember that it may be hard for someone else to make friends too and you could be that one person that could help someone else out.Remember to do things that benefit your inner-self and not for the purpose of finding “someone.” There shouldn’t be any pressure to look at people romantically.Stepping out of your comfort zone and trying new things can lead to new friends and amusing experiences. It all starts with you smiling and saying hello to someone else. Try saying hi with a smile when you’re at the grocery store, while you’re walking down the street, when you’re meeting someone for the first time at a party, etc.Whatever the situation is, just try to put yourself out there and you’ll gain more confidence over time, eventually this will turn into a new habit. Seeing other people smile is also contagious so if you start the smile train, others will reciprocate and you will both be in great moods.A good way to keep yourself out of your comfort zone is to try a 30 day habitevery month. Make sure to try new things, experiment and do things you might not do otherwise. You may even find some great habits you want to keep forever.Habit #7 – Use Your Alone Time WiselyMany people might think that the answer to being happy is a simple one: just do things that make you happy.However, due to psychological attachments, this is not true at all. You may enjoy chowing down on a quart of Rocky Road ice-cream. You may enjoy watching an entire season of Dexter in a single sitting. But in the long run these things will not bring you the happiness you desire and are quite likely to bring you guilt and remorse.There are many things you can do when you’re alone and watching meaningless TV shows or eating your favorite comfort food might seem like a great idea at the time, but for purposes of happiness they are often counterproductive.I am not saying to never enjoy mindless tasks or have a treat, these can be okay once in a while, but why not use this time wisely and get to know yourself better,, learn something about yourself or challenge your mind.Read a great biography, watch an inspirational documentary, start a new business or create a new website. Lose yourself in your art, music, woodworking, cooking or any other meaningful work.Need some inspiration? Spend all day at a gallery or museum and let your mind experience different reactions and emotions to these art pieces or educational experiences. Choose your time wisely and make sure that at the end of the day, you were happy and satisfied with what you accomplished.Remember, at this point in your life, you are alone so you are able to create something meaningful and spend as much time as you like doing what you love to do. When you lose yourself fully into your work, you will become proud of what you have created and this will leave you fulfilled and happy.Creating smart and realistic goals attached with a timeline will help keep you motivated. Start off small and focus on your most important tasks first. Once you get into a routine, you will not even have to think about your daily to-do schedule because you will have programmed your mind to just do it and get it done.Another great advantage of being alone is that your goals do not need to involve any outside influences. You can be, do, and have whatever you dream of. You can create an amazing future for yourself, and by yourself.Why not take this time to focus on one or two aspects of your life that you have wanted to improve. Whether this involves your health, career, spirituality or finances, don’t let these wants and aspirations continue to be pushed to the side.Think about how you would feel and why it would be beneficial to have all aspects of your life in order and under control and you will be able to envision a brighter future, which will help motivate you to pursue and stick with your goals.Habit #8 – Learn to Appreciate the PresentWe are who we become because of our life experiences from the past. Forgive yourself and acknowledge your mistakes from the past. Remember that the past does not always dictate your future. We all make mistakes and your mistakes do not define whom you are or whom you could be. Learn from mistakes, but celebrate the small wins of the present.Think of the person that you were 5, 10, or 25 years ago. There will be many challenges, situations and obstacles that will come and go our way during our lives. If you had never made any mistakes or harbored any flaws, what type of person would you be now? What types of experiences would you have had and how happy would you really be if you were striving to be perfect for your whole life?Life can be busy and hectic enough, sometimes just having the time to sit back and enjoy a nice cup of green tea could be something that can refresh and revive you. Don’t think of the things you do not have but live in the “now” and appreciate the small things in life that help you relax and enjoy what you have in life to it’s fullest.http://www.newsnytro.com/

How did you learn to live alone?
Can we live our life alone?
How do we learn to live alone?
Living alone is perhaps the most arduous task given you crave attention and interaction with people. Being alone gives you power to handle and an opportunity to get head to head with situations without any help that indeed make you stronger at the end.Loving your solitude is an art not everyone is profound at. It takes suffering and a paramount patience to get to that point. I can't say I still love being alone but to some extent I have learnt to accept these emotions and entailing emptiness.So how do we learn to live alone…..When after Doing everything to please the person you like to be with you leave you empty with your own depreciating thoughts to deal with.When your love for other is deemed an annoyance ,like you are infringing upon their life.When people contact you only when they require something, and when you need help everyone gets invisible in jiffy.When your respect is marred owing to your humble and affable nature .When you are judged , ridiculed for you not-so-great look .When you are unable to convey your pain to other ,and slowly learn to deal with your own.When you try to get relief with your pain by getting into trivial relationship and ends in a thud.When no one loves to give you company and their precious time.When slowly but painfully you learn that solitude is perhaps better than someone by your side.When you learn that when alone you will not be hurt by anyone. That no one will leave you in excruciating cringe,that might take years to heal.Yes , initially it was gloomy, perhaps spooky to get through it. But yes , eventually you will realise it's ensconcing abode . Where you will get all creativity shooting forth.So it's good to be alone……..You will never learn to worship God within ,If you are craving for its embodiment outside.GS……

How do I learn to live alone ?
You can't really learn to live alone, but you can sort of ease into it. The key is to be able to enjoy alone time. Try doing things by yourself such as going for a vacation alone or going for a movie alone or planning to go out for lunch/ dinner by yourself or even cooking for yourself. If you enjoy doing these (and other similar) things on your own, then you are already on your way to enjoying solitude. If not, then start by making these experiences enjoyable. For example, if you don't like cooking just for yourself (most people don't!), try putting on your favourite music while you're cooking. Also, plan and cook special/ new things, like you would if you had company. Do something similar for other daily activities too.Use the alone time to do things you may not have been able to do had you been cohabiting. For example, learning to play a musical instrument or a dance form. This will occupy you as well as divert your attention from being alone.Then there is the lighter side to it as well. You can find comfort in that you can take longer showers without having anyone banging on your bathroom door, you can watch ridiculous TV soaps without being judged, you can eat ice cream straight out the bucket (:P) without being told off and so on.One last piece of advice. Living alone can sometimes take a toll. You never know when you slip into being lonely. To counter that, you should ensure that you have a daily routine and stick to it. At the same time, stay open to changes like going out with friends, someone coming over for dinner etc. Be in regular touch with friends and family. Even if they can't be physically present, talking or video chatting with them will do you good.And finally, I wrote a quote on my blog post once that I would like to share here:There is a difference between being alone and being lonely: know it. Don't ever be afraid of being alone. And don't get too used to being lonely.p.s. - These thoughts are coming from someone who has never lived alone, although very much desires to. But I have managed to create my own space (physically as well as mentally) even while cohabiting, where I am able to enjoy solitude. I also travel solo, go for movies/ shopping/ coffee on my own.p.p.s. - If you don't want to live alone, get a dog. I know I will get one when I go off to live alone.Cheers,
How do I learn to live alone ?
Well it depends on the type of goals you have in your life.Let me explain it.If you are going to be a coder, sits on a computer. Then write some blogs in your free time. By some time, you will be in your professional stage this thing will eventually compound and you will see the results later.If you are going to be a person at administration: read some newspapers.If you are going to an entrepreneur: read books.I know the above answers are bad. You read about them at some platform and constantly want new answers, facts, basically you want new, new.So what I'm trying to say thay instead of sitting still in your reckliner, find some hobby, passion, which drives you for the day.Visit library, go for a long drive, run in the morning, eat healthy, watch news, watch Netflix, see the war between world, install 9gag use Firefox, do squats, organize your room, change the sitting arrangement at your place, do painting, learn martial arts, change habits, read books.And remember change your habits it will change you, believe me.Thank you.Get a dog.

How do I prepare to live alone?
I looked at Find Your Spot | Find Your Spot to find the place I would best fit. Several places popped up.Then I did homework about the places I found at City-Data.com - Stats about all US cities - real estate, relocation info, crime, house prices, cost of living, races, home value estimator, recent sales, income, photos, schools, maps, weather, neighborhoods, and moreWhen I found the place I wanted to live, I went to several rental websites like Apartments for Rent - Rent.com® Apartment Finder and other rental websites in the new town.I found a lot of apartments but most of them were very expensive. I printed out the information sheets and map locations for about six different locations in different parts of town so I could choose the right neighborhood.Since the location was over a thousand miles from my home town I found a hotel near the airport with low weekly rates. I planned to fly there and stay a week, rent a car to drive around and look at the apartments.I did like one apartment on my list, but driving around I found another apartment building that was older, and off the radar. It was even cheaper and better than the cheapest one on my list.I had to sign a two year lease and the move-in date was a minimum of another week away so they could prepare my new apartment. I flew home again, packed up my car and drove to my new apartment.I needed money for a two-way flight and car rental, hotel, gas for the rental car, gas for my car, hotels when I drove across country, rental deposit, first month's rent, a new bed (used furniture are against the apartment's policy because of the risk of bed bugs). Luckily I didn't bring any furniture with me and I could furnish my new apartment with better fitting furniture.The whole move cost was at least $3,000 but I would plan on having more than that just in case, but do not carry large amounts of cash because it might be seized by police who suspect you of drug dealing.
What is the best advice for a person who is beginning to live alone?
There will be a time, when you close the door and sit down. Then there will be silence. And then it happens... You will know what I mean when it happens. It is a special feeling. You are alone, nobody will enter your room, you are not responsible for anyone but you. This can get a certain dynamic.In a bad way it can lead to inertness. You are missing the drive and sit around. Or it can get boredom or in worst cases even more...However, this can also be the most beautiful time. Then, when you realize that being alone with yourself is a perfect chance to experience yourself. You can treat yourself nice, you can meditate (take this advice serious), you can read... you are not responsible for anyone... and if you sit with open doors in your restroom, nobody is bothered... if you sing in your room, nobody is bothered... if you run naked through your room... etc. Enjoy this freedom. See it as most enjoyable time with someone you love (with yourself). Soon enough this might change again... And when you are married and have lots of children, you might miss that time.

Never try mixing the two terms together.Good luck!
How do I begin to live alone?
For the first time or is it after a death or sudden being alone?For the first time then check its viable financialy,if so then set up the money so you always have a roof over your head and food in the cupboard.A routine is good,with the cleaning and so on.Set days/times things are to be done and try and stick to it.Set aside time for yourself out of the home,additional to work,maybe a gym or golfing,book club,shooting whatever but get a hobby so you meet different people.Cook proper food for yourself,it gets you out shopping and is theraputic at night cooking a meal,also saves getting on the junk food wagon and is cheaper.I loved living alone,I read a lot,sometimes at home,the park,the pub even on a afternoon.But you need other people in your life so make sure you do something,anything to make you go out a few times a week.I suppose the same applies after a death,being totally alone all the time is never good for you so make a effort,as hard as it can be.

Awesome!You get to wake up with the one you loveYou know that you are lovedYou feel safe in that you know what your routines areThere is a deeper more comfortable love that forms and is more powerful than the short term After 8 years I have really got to know my wife and that means we can know what she is thinking and know how to be there for herIt is a more selfless way of being You get to learn different ways of seeing things from a female perspective and she can learn a masculine perspective also.If things get hard you know that your real only option is to sort it out. Somehow this makes it easierYou don't have to worry about the crap of clubbing, drunk people, uncertainty of whether this person is interesting or whether they are interested in youIn conclusion don't marry just anyone, find someone, that you are sure you want to be with. Then you get to bet half of everything you own that you want them and only them for the rest of your life.If you get it right, then you win the lottery.

What will make a married man cheat on his wife?
This question is a big question. I take marriage as living together and sharing responsibility for a very long time (hopefully to death). The legal piece is just a piece of paper.For me, it has many emotional and material benefits. Assuming you got married to a kind and genuine person.Emotional benefits:1- You mutually decide to have a very long term relationship with someone you love. This trait is hard to find, so wonderful and easy to take for granted.2- Life is not easy. Even for us, who have good jobs and relatively good situations, sometimes life is hard and depressing. Sometimes you lose control of your emotions in the hurdle of life. Reminding each other to be grateful for what we have, in those hard times, is priceless.3- Being able to share pretty much everything, and discuss pretty much everything. Now, this is something you can’t find with many people. If you tell your friends that you are having a hard time at work, or arguing with your friend, they will potentially judge you, and you will reach no solution. The trusted spouse will listen to you, share her opinion, help with a real solution, and keep it to herself.4- You wake up at night, you feel like she is not breathing for a moment, sweat cold, then check and verify her breathing, become the happiest person again. That happiness is not comparable to anything else.Material benefits:1- You merge wallets, double the income, and share the costs with maybe 1.2x of your single expenses. This advantage helps to gain financial freedom easier. Requires everyone spending responsibly though.2- Share all the tedious housework and make it fun. She does vacuuming when you clean the patio, etc.3- A friend that comes to every vacation, every dinner you have, and that can carpool with you every single day. You never feel lonely. This benefit is both material and emotional.As you see, these all require two good people to get married. If one of them starts exploiting the other, things go downhill.I wish everyone find their favorite person and live a great life. Don’t listen to those who compare marriage to temporary stuff like housemates or paid services like housekeeping, etc. Life is never that material.Lastly. If you are getting ‘permissions’ from each other when married, something is wrong. There should be no permission. There should be respect instead.
What is like to be married?
2 marriages: 2 different experiencesmarriage 1: making the best of a marriage I was manipulated into. Threat of divorce made me take job as high school teacher instead of continuing education as desired. Had kids because my wife wanted them, then got vasectomy. Some happy times, but also struggle over whose needs would be met. Eventually she fell in love with her boss, told me she didn’t love me, and plunged me into deepest depression of my life.marriage 2: both madly in love and wanted marriage as commitment. 36 years so far of love expressed in words and deeds. Each delights in giving other the things he/she finds important. Feeling of partnership in making life happy for both. Quarrels, generally just because one is upset and never about anything basic, are quickly made up. We both sincerely believe life couldn’t be better than this for us, except for the long, hot summers where we live.

I get to spend the entire day with her doing things with her, conversing with her and just enjoying the blessings that God has given me! And then I get to go to bed with her at night! I can think of no better way to enjoy and soak in life. Just hearing her speak is thrilling to me. She is more than I could have ever dreamed of and more than I deserve.

1 – Figure Out What Makes You Truly HappyIf you have recently gotten out of a relationship, or are simply not currently interested in anyone, then try not to look at this stage in your life as a negative thing. Being single gives you a wonderful opportunity to figure out what truly makes you happy and gives you the perfect chance to get to know yourself better.Being single grants you the time and freedom to do whatever you want on your own schedule and allows you to put your needs, desires, and ambitions above all others.Not being in a relationship will help you realize and understand that your happiness does not have to depend on someone else’s presence. You need to be able to be happy alone first, and love yourself in order to give your love to someone else and have a successful relationship.If you don’t know what is going to make you happy, how can you expect someone else to? You need to know and experience what real love and happiness is like by yourself before you commit to loving someone else.It might be scary at first but here are some ideas that can help you to feel more positive about being alone.Get to know yourself by spending some time alone in solitude. Do something that will help you relax and focus on your mind, body and soul. Go shopping, take a bath, listen to some new music, have a glass of wine, watch a marathon of your favorite show and don’t feel guilty about treating yourself or making yourself a top priority.Habit #2 – Give Yourself a Fresh StartSometimes we get stuck in monotonous schedules and our days feel like they merge together into a week that’s exactly the same as the last. Maybe you have forgotten what it’s like to feel happy because you simply aren’t stimulated with what’s happening in your life. Perhaps it’s time to write a list of all the fun things and activities that make you smile.Write down new places you would like to explore, games you would like to learn how to play, or books you would like to read. Once you start making this list, you will look forward to trying these new things and you will start to get excited about the possibilities available to you.Sometimes all it takes to feel refreshed and happy is to change something simple out of your daily routine. Maybe it’s time to rearrange your furniture or redecorate your house.By changing something in your surroundings, it will help you start fresh and prevent you from feeling like your life is stagnant. You can also look at moving, rearranging or redecorating your house to create an instant fresh start or renewal of your current stage in life.Plan a cleaning or de-cluttering session. Get rid of things that are collecting dust or that you have been hanging on to because you’ll feel guilty if you throw them out. Remember that it’s time to start living for you and no one else. Only keep things that make you happy, are important, useful and meaningful to you.Habit #3 – Practice Self-LoveSelf-love is a state of appreciation for oneself that grows from actions that support our physical, psychological and spiritual growth. [source] When you stop thinking about how other people can make you happy and practice self-love, you will soon realize what it feels like to be happy alone and be able to learn to love and accept yourself from the inside out.Here are some ways you can practice self-love:Stop putting so much value on what others think and stop striving for perfection. Everyone has their flaws whether they tell you or not. Once you have accepted that being alone is normal and natural, you will begin to realize that it’s okay and be perfectly happy while alone.Alone time will allow you to be mindful of your thoughts and surroundings. You will be able to feel happiness and peace and know that you have absolutely everything inside of yourself that you need to be completely fulfilled. You do not need to expect anything from anyone else.A great way to practice self-love includes writing down things that you love about yourself. Focus on the positives; you are healthy, unique and have great hair, wonderful personality,nice legs, beautiful eyes, or whatever you decide.You can also practice self-love by being aware of your negative thoughts. If you are constantly thinking with a dark cloud overhead then you will never leave room to let the sunshine through. There is a positive side and a negative side to almost any situation. Train your mind to think of the positive outcome and, over time, this will start to happen naturally.Another way to get out of the negative thought clouds is to surround yourself with positive things and people. If you are at a low point, you might not even want to get off of the couch and reach for the phone but it’s important to get out of the house and be around friends and family who love you and who will help you take your mind off of whatever it is that’s bringing you down.If you tend to avoid the phone or make plans, then try committing to something up front. If you commit to something, then you will be less likely to back out when the time comes to actually do it.Here’s an example: Pre-pay for a 10-week kickboxing class or sports league. Once you have made that up front long-term commitment, it will be much harder for you to say no to these plans, even when you are having a bad day.Habit #4 – Exercise and Build a Healthy LifestyleMaybe it’s time to reconnect with yourself on a physical level. Start a new exercise program that will help you get into shape, feel good about your body, and even reap the numerous benefits of endorphins.Working out shouldn’t always seem like a chore, there are some great programs like spinning, zumba, or even Xbox games that will allow you workout with others in a fun way. If you commit to joining a class and have a friend that signs up with you, you will be less likely to quit and you will have double the fun while you workout.If you do not wish to make a big commitment, then start out small and check out some different types of workouts in free workout tutorials on YouTube to see which ones fit you best. Make these new exercises a part of your morning routine so it will keep you refreshed during the day. The best part about morning workouts is that you won’t be thinking about having to workout for the rest of the day because it’s already done!If you have a dog, you should have no problem going for a daily 20-minute walk or run. Your dog will love you for it and will help keep you committed by reminding you that it’s time for your daily walk; how can you say no to those cute little puppy eyes?What’s eating you; or more like, what are you eating? Sometimes our diet can affect our happiness and bring our mood down. Take a look at what you have been eating, and look for healthier alternatives. A great way to do this is to use an app or diary for one week and write down everything that you have consumed. You might be surprised at just how much unhealthy food you are eating and when you review your journal at the end of the week, you will be able to see where there’s room for improvement in your diet.In addition to the quality of the food we eat, the quantity of the food we eat can also effect our moods and happiness. Often people turn to food when they begin to feel sad and depressed. Eating can give some quick relief but it is always followed by self-recriminations if you eat too much. Not only that but consuming large amounts of food can lead to lethargy. Simply by controlling portion sizes of the food we eat, we not only help to keep ourselves healthier, but also happier.Sleep is also extremely important in order to keep you energized throughout the day and it even has the added benefits of helping you lose weight and keeping a healthy lifestyle, mind, and heart. [Creating good sleep habits] Go to bed early and sleep in once in a while, but make sure you find a balanced schedule. One of the best benefits of being alone is that you can take up the whole bed without getting kicked or nudged in your sleep!Habit #5 – Find Your Passion and Cultivate ItIs there something you’ve always wanted to do but keep putting it off? What’s wrong with trying it now? When you’re alone, you no longer have to consider other people’s plans. Choose to do something different that will be a challenge for you. It doesn’t matter what it is. It just needs to be something that you’re passionate about.If you love animals, why not volunteer once a week to help out your local shelter? If you’re stuck on ideas, then there are many fun websites that can help you out with this decision; local dance classes, art classes, photography classes, acting lessons, cooking classes, day trips, guitar lessons you name it, you can find it in your area.Sometimes we don’t truly find our passion in life until we have tried and experienced many different things. You should keep in mind that there is never any harm in trying something new and experiencing something new can actually be quite fun. It will get you out of the house, allow you to be around new and positive people and help you renew your confidence for learning new things.Habit #6 – Step Out of Your Comfort ZoneTry doing things that you’ve never done before. Try not to have your guard up and be open to all possibilities; you don’t know that you won’t like something until you’ve tried it.A great way to step out of your comfort zone is to go somewhere and do something new and fun each week.Another great thing about being alone is that no one is there to say no or disagree with your plans.When you start experiencing new things, places and events, you will probably be meeting new people and make some new friends. This may seem difficult at first if you are shy but putting yourself in other people’s shoes might help. Remember that it may be hard for someone else to make friends too and you could be that one person that could help someone else out.Remember to do things that benefit your inner-self and not for the purpose of finding “someone.” There shouldn’t be any pressure to look at people romantically.Stepping out of your comfort zone and trying new things can lead to new friends and amusing experiences. It all starts with you smiling and saying hello to someone else. Try saying hi with a smile when you’re at the grocery store, while you’re walking down the street, when you’re meeting someone for the first time at a party, etc.Whatever the situation is, just try to put yourself out there and you’ll gain more confidence over time, eventually this will turn into a new habit. Seeing other people smile is also contagious so if you start the smile train, others will reciprocate and you will both be in great moods.A good way to keep yourself out of your comfort zone is to try a 30 day habitevery month. Make sure to try new things, experiment and do things you might not do otherwise. You may even find some great habits you want to keep forever.Habit #7 – Use Your Alone Time WiselyMany people might think that the answer to being happy is a simple one: just do things that make you happy.However, due to psychological attachments, this is not true at all. You may enjoy chowing down on a quart of Rocky Road ice-cream. You may enjoy watching an entire season of Dexter in a single sitting. But in the long run these things will not bring you the happiness you desire and are quite likely to bring you guilt and remorse.There are many things you can do when you’re alone and watching meaningless TV shows or eating your favorite comfort food might seem like a great idea at the time, but for purposes of happiness they are often counterproductive.I am not saying to never enjoy mindless tasks or have a treat, these can be okay once in a while, but why not use this time wisely and get to know yourself better,, learn something about yourself or challenge your mind.Read a great biography, watch an inspirational documentary, start a new business or create a new website. Lose yourself in your art, music, woodworking, cooking or any other meaningful work.Need some inspiration? Spend all day at a gallery or museum and let your mind experience different reactions and emotions to these art pieces or educational experiences. Choose your time wisely and make sure that at the end of the day, you were happy and satisfied with what you accomplished.Remember, at this point in your life, you are alone so you are able to create something meaningful and spend as much time as you like doing what you love to do. When you lose yourself fully into your work, you will become proud of what you have created and this will leave you fulfilled and happy.Creating smart and realistic goals attached with a timeline will help keep you motivated. Start off small and focus on your most important tasks first. Once you get into a routine, you will not even have to think about your daily to-do schedule because you will have programmed your mind to just do it and get it done.Another great advantage of being alone is that your goals do not need to involve any outside influences. You can be, do, and have whatever you dream of. You can create an amazing future for yourself, and by yourself.Why not take this time to focus on one or two aspects of your life that you have wanted to improve. Whether this involves your health, career, spirituality or finances, don’t let these wants and aspirations continue to be pushed to the side.Think about how you would feel and why it would be beneficial to have all aspects of your life in order and under control and you will be able to envision a brighter future, which will help motivate you to pursue and stick with your goals.Habit #8 – Learn to Appreciate the PresentWe are who we become because of our life experiences from the past. Forgive yourself and acknowledge your mistakes from the past. Remember that the past does not always dictate your future. We all make mistakes and your mistakes do not define whom you are or whom you could be. Learn from mistakes, but celebrate the small wins of the present.Think of the person that you were 5, 10, or 25 years ago. There will be many challenges, situations and obstacles that will come and go our way during our lives. If you had never made any mistakes or harbored any flaws, what type of person would you be now? What types of experiences would you have had and how happy would you really be if you were striving to be perfect for your whole life?Life can be busy and hectic enough, sometimes just having the time to sit back and enjoy a nice cup of green tea could be something that can refresh and revive you. Don’t think of the things you do not have but live in the “now” and appreciate the small things in life that help you relax and enjoy what you have in life to it’s fullest.http://www.newsnytro.com/

Why it is important to learn to live alone?
How do I learn to live alone ?
You can't really learn to live alone, but you can sort of ease into it. The key is to be able to enjoy alone time. Try doing things by yourself such as going for a vacation alone or going for a movie alone or planning to go out for lunch/ dinner by yourself or even cooking for yourself. If you enjoy doing these (and other similar) things on your own, then you are already on your way to enjoying solitude. If not, then start by making these experiences enjoyable. For example, if you don't like cooking just for yourself (most people don't!), try putting on your favourite music while you're cooking. Also, plan and cook special/ new things, like you would if you had company. Do something similar for other daily activities too.Use the alone time to do things you may not have been able to do had you been cohabiting. For example, learning to play a musical instrument or a dance form. This will occupy you as well as divert your attention from being alone.Then there is the lighter side to it as well. You can find comfort in that you can take longer showers without having anyone banging on your bathroom door, you can watch ridiculous TV soaps without being judged, you can eat ice cream straight out the bucket (:P) without being told off and so on.One last piece of advice. Living alone can sometimes take a toll. You never know when you slip into being lonely. To counter that, you should ensure that you have a daily routine and stick to it. At the same time, stay open to changes like going out with friends, someone coming over for dinner etc. Be in regular touch with friends and family. Even if they can't be physically present, talking or video chatting with them will do you good.And finally, I wrote a quote on my blog post once that I would like to share here:There is a difference between being alone and being lonely: know it. Don't ever be afraid of being alone. And don't get too used to being lonely.p.s. - These thoughts are coming from someone who has never lived alone, although very much desires to. But I have managed to create my own space (physically as well as mentally) even while cohabiting, where I am able to enjoy solitude. I also travel solo, go for movies/ shopping/ coffee on my own.p.p.s. - If you don't want to live alone, get a dog. I know I will get one when I go off to live alone.Cheers,
How do we learn to live alone?
Living alone is perhaps the most arduous task given you crave attention and interaction with people. Being alone gives you power to handle and an opportunity to get head to head with situations without any help that indeed make you stronger at the end.Loving your solitude is an art not everyone is profound at. It takes suffering and a paramount patience to get to that point. I can't say I still love being alone but to some extent I have learnt to accept these emotions and entailing emptiness.So how do we learn to live alone…..When after Doing everything to please the person you like to be with you leave you empty with your own depreciating thoughts to deal with.When your love for other is deemed an annoyance ,like you are infringing upon their life.When people contact you only when they require something, and when you need help everyone gets invisible in jiffy.When your respect is marred owing to your humble and affable nature .When you are judged , ridiculed for you not-so-great look .When you are unable to convey your pain to other ,and slowly learn to deal with your own.When you try to get relief with your pain by getting into trivial relationship and ends in a thud.When no one loves to give you company and their precious time.When slowly but painfully you learn that solitude is perhaps better than someone by your side.When you learn that when alone you will not be hurt by anyone. That no one will leave you in excruciating cringe,that might take years to heal.Yes , initially it was gloomy, perhaps spooky to get through it. But yes , eventually you will realise it's ensconcing abode . Where you will get all creativity shooting forth.So it's good to be alone……..You will never learn to worship God within ,If you are craving for its embodiment outside.GS……
How do I learn to live alone ?
Well it depends on the type of goals you have in your life.Let me explain it.If you are going to be a coder, sits on a computer. Then write some blogs in your free time. By some time, you will be in your professional stage this thing will eventually compound and you will see the results later.If you are going to be a person at administration: read some newspapers.If you are going to an entrepreneur: read books.I know the above answers are bad. You read about them at some platform and constantly want new answers, facts, basically you want new, new.So what I'm trying to say thay instead of sitting still in your reckliner, find some hobby, passion, which drives you for the day.Visit library, go for a long drive, run in the morning, eat healthy, watch news, watch Netflix, see the war between world, install 9gag use Firefox, do squats, organize your room, change the sitting arrangement at your place, do painting, learn martial arts, change habits, read books.And remember change your habits it will change you, believe me.Thank you.Get a dog.

How do I prepare to live alone?
I looked at Find Your Spot | Find Your Spot to find the place I would best fit. Several places popped up.Then I did homework about the places I found at City-Data.com - Stats about all US cities - real estate, relocation info, crime, house prices, cost of living, races, home value estimator, recent sales, income, photos, schools, maps, weather, neighborhoods, and moreWhen I found the place I wanted to live, I went to several rental websites like Apartments for Rent - Rent.com® Apartment Finder and other rental websites in the new town.I found a lot of apartments but most of them were very expensive. I printed out the information sheets and map locations for about six different locations in different parts of town so I could choose the right neighborhood.Since the location was over a thousand miles from my home town I found a hotel near the airport with low weekly rates. I planned to fly there and stay a week, rent a car to drive around and look at the apartments.I did like one apartment on my list, but driving around I found another apartment building that was older, and off the radar. It was even cheaper and better than the cheapest one on my list.I had to sign a two year lease and the move-in date was a minimum of another week away so they could prepare my new apartment. I flew home again, packed up my car and drove to my new apartment.I needed money for a two-way flight and car rental, hotel, gas for the rental car, gas for my car, hotels when I drove across country, rental deposit, first month's rent, a new bed (used furniture are against the apartment's policy because of the risk of bed bugs). Luckily I didn't bring any furniture with me and I could furnish my new apartment with better fitting furniture.The whole move cost was at least $3,000 but I would plan on having more than that just in case, but do not carry large amounts of cash because it might be seized by police who suspect you of drug dealing.
What is the best advice for a person who is beginning to live alone?
There will be a time, when you close the door and sit down. Then there will be silence. And then it happens... You will know what I mean when it happens. It is a special feeling. You are alone, nobody will enter your room, you are not responsible for anyone but you. This can get a certain dynamic.In a bad way it can lead to inertness. You are missing the drive and sit around. Or it can get boredom or in worst cases even more...However, this can also be the most beautiful time. Then, when you realize that being alone with yourself is a perfect chance to experience yourself. You can treat yourself nice, you can meditate (take this advice serious), you can read... you are not responsible for anyone... and if you sit with open doors in your restroom, nobody is bothered... if you sing in your room, nobody is bothered... if you run naked through your room... etc. Enjoy this freedom. See it as most enjoyable time with someone you love (with yourself). Soon enough this might change again... And when you are married and have lots of children, you might miss that time.

However, learning to live alone is the most peaceful thing on Earth, you don't have to bother or rely on someone else, you learn things on your own, which means you become more independent, and living alone also makes you understand life better.Never forget the difference between living alone and being lonely,To live alone is always a positive way to approach life.However, being pessimistic about life and yourself will make you lonely. Never try mixing the two terms together.Good luck!

How do I begin to live alone?
For the first time or is it after a death or sudden being alone?For the first time then check its viable financialy,if so then set up the money so you always have a roof over your head and food in the cupboard.A routine is good,with the cleaning and so on.Set days/times things are to be done and try and stick to it.Set aside time for yourself out of the home,additional to work,maybe a gym or golfing,book club,shooting whatever but get a hobby so you meet different people.Cook proper food for yourself,it gets you out shopping and is theraputic at night cooking a meal,also saves getting on the junk food wagon and is cheaper.I loved living alone,I read a lot,sometimes at home,the park,the pub even on a afternoon.But you need other people in your life so make sure you do something,anything to make you go out a few times a week.I suppose the same applies after a death,being totally alone all the time is never good for you so make a effort,as hard as it can be.

What is it like to be married?
Awesome!You get to wake up with the one you loveYou know that you are lovedYou feel safe in that you know what your routines areThere is a deeper more comfortable love that forms and is more powerful than the short term After 8 years I have really got to know my wife and that means we can know what she is thinking and know how to be there for herIt is a more selfless way of being You get to learn different ways of seeing things from a female perspective and she can learn a masculine perspective also.If things get hard you know that your real only option is to sort it out. Somehow this makes it easierYou don't have to worry about the crap of clubbing, drunk people, uncertainty of whether this person is interesting or whether they are interested in youIn conclusion don't marry just anyone, find someone, that you are sure you want to be with. Then you get to bet half of everything you own that you want them and only them for the rest of your life.If you get it right, then you win the lottery.

What will make a married man cheat on his wife?
This question is a big question. I take marriage as living together and sharing responsibility for a very long time (hopefully to death). The legal piece is just a piece of paper.For me, it has many emotional and material benefits. Assuming you got married to a kind and genuine person.Emotional benefits:1- You mutually decide to have a very long term relationship with someone you love. This trait is hard to find, so wonderful and easy to take for granted.2- Life is not easy. Even for us, who have good jobs and relatively good situations, sometimes life is hard and depressing. Sometimes you lose control of your emotions in the hurdle of life. Reminding each other to be grateful for what we have, in those hard times, is priceless.3- Being able to share pretty much everything, and discuss pretty much everything. Now, this is something you can’t find with many people. If you tell your friends that you are having a hard time at work, or arguing with your friend, they will potentially judge you, and you will reach no solution. The trusted spouse will listen to you, share her opinion, help with a real solution, and keep it to herself.4- You wake up at night, you feel like she is not breathing for a moment, sweat cold, then check and verify her breathing, become the happiest person again. That happiness is not comparable to anything else.Material benefits:1- You merge wallets, double the income, and share the costs with maybe 1.2x of your single expenses. This advantage helps to gain financial freedom easier. Requires everyone spending responsibly though.2- Share all the tedious housework and make it fun. She does vacuuming when you clean the patio, etc.3- A friend that comes to every vacation, every dinner you have, and that can carpool with you every single day. You never feel lonely. This benefit is both material and emotional.As you see, these all require two good people to get married. If one of them starts exploiting the other, things go downhill.I wish everyone find their favorite person and live a great life. Don’t listen to those who compare marriage to temporary stuff like housemates or paid services like housekeeping, etc. Life is never that material.Lastly. If you are getting ‘permissions’ from each other when married, something is wrong. There should be no permission. There should be respect instead.
What is like to be married?
2 marriages: 2 different experiencesmarriage 1: making the best of a marriage I was manipulated into. Threat of divorce made me take job as high school teacher instead of continuing education as desired. Had kids because my wife wanted them, then got vasectomy. Some happy times, but also struggle over whose needs would be met. Eventually she fell in love with her boss, told me she didn’t love me, and plunged me into deepest depression of my life.marriage 2: both madly in love and wanted marriage as commitment. 36 years so far of love expressed in words and deeds. Each delights in giving other the things he/she finds important. Feeling of partnership in making life happy for both. Quarrels, generally just because one is upset and never about anything basic, are quickly made up. We both sincerely believe life couldn’t be better than this for us, except for the long, hot summers where we live.

Is the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life! I get to wake up next to her and see your beautiful face in the morning sleeping! I get to spend the entire day with her doing things with her, conversing with her and just enjoying the blessings that God has given me! And then I get to go to bed with her at night! I can think of no better way to enjoy and soak in life. Just hearing her speak is thrilling to me. She is more than I could have ever dreamed of and more than I deserve.

It's one of those things you won't ever understand until you get to experience yourself, and even then you still can never fully describe to an outsider what it really is like.

Is living alone good or bad?
“Living alone never felt right, sometimes it feels good but it never felt right.”Every now and then you need somebody by your side to share your day’s work, your feelings with them but finding not a single person in a world of billions to talk to about your problems about yourself, not a single friend and even isolating yourself from parents because they never understand you, feels like crying continuously and let that pain out or sleeping whole day to never face reality.Yes! Happiness is alone time, just me and my bed.But sometimes that room my couch my solitude sucks!Typing ‘I am good’, ‘Life is beautiful’ ,‘I am fine.’ with tears continuously rolling down your eyes and trembling fingers hurts. It chokes!The person on the other side never know how you are feeling. Telling them also don’t work often.Because sometimes it is only you who understand YOURSELF better than anyone else.And then you want to run away for a while. Get a break from everything. So that you can build yourself strong enough again, pick up that load efficiently and so that you don’t shatter in pieces. But you can’t like just run away.Because you have to face it and Be a warrior B)Happy Life :)

Sleep and wake up any time depending on one's convenience.    The Flip side to this:it  Will be difficult  to share the room or space with another person once you are used to this kind of freedom and space.The occasional feeling of loneliness as some times it could be boring Living alone is expensive as room Sharing is more economical you might end up paying extra for lesser comforts as compared to a peer who is sharing a room with someone.
What's bad about living alone?
I worry that I'll die and no one will realize for several months and I'll finally get my 15 minutes of fame posthumously in stories about how society forgets people.Also, that it'll be by choking on my food and no one will be around to pound my back.  I've given up eating Mint Imperials for this reason.It's lonely for the first year or so.  Then I got over it and found it quite liberating.  No one else to help with the household expenses.That's about it, for me at least.  Other people wouldn't handle it so well, especially the type who need to someone to talk to every day.
LIving alone is not a good choice. But sometimes we have to face this situation. We came to this world by alone and leaving here by alone. In between our birth and death we meet many and living as a social animal. Some circumstances make us to live alone for a periods.it is not parmanant. If we alone at home for a while, no need to worry. We can make good friends in our society.

What is it like to live alone?
Yes it can be a lot more joyous than you think it can beSo during past 4 years since I started working , I have lived in almost all types of places with all types of peopleIn a PG - 3 people sharing a single roomIn a 3 bhk flat - 2 people sharing a single roomIn a 3 bhk flat - 1 person per roomNow alone in a 2bhk apartmentSo having experiene in all types of accommodation I can definitely say that living alone has been the best experience for me. Here are some advantages which I found personally:-No shifting homes : I have lived in 7 different homes in the past 4 years due to shifting of roommates, incompatible roommates, theft of personal belongings, bad food, to stay with friends, job change. Now since I am not dependent on anyone , I no longer have to shift home unless a job change, so definately a positive :)Free living: When i come from office, I like to have a self time and do whatever I want to do, play music, watch netflix , walk around or do nothing at all . You don't need to be obliged to talk to someone, or adjust as per other person will.Get rid of useless discussions : I can tell you from my experience, that living with girls you tend to get involved in useless discussions and petty issues and deal with them on a regular bases, and they could range from using kitchen stuff, to maintaining cleanliness, listening to high sound music, smoking issues, boyfriend issues to what not. Though I had some pretty good roommates but a good compatibility level between everyone is rarely possible and people always like to complain.Get more independent: When you live alone, you end up doing almost all the house work, from cooking, cleaning to maintaining the house from paying electricity bills, maid to everything, and in the process you learn a lot.Parents can visit you anytime: Earlier my mom was hesitant to visit me bcoz it could create discomfort to my roommates, but since I am living alone, whenever she gets a holiday she visits me and happily helps me in setting up my home. It is something which I wanted from the past 4 yearsYou can host parties and night stay for friends: My place has became the place for all parties which I like hosting and we always have a place to stay over with my friends, my school friends sometimes just come over for weekend stay and we could spend the weekend talking and sleepingWear anything: I can wear anything or nothing, since I am alone at home, I love being in the most comfortable clothing's that I could not wear when staying with peopleKeep my room as I like: I love decorating my room and I can keep it the way I like it , which was not possible when I was sharing my room.Setting up your home: I have seen most people don't like spending too much on how they live, they think they will buy stuff once they are married or settled. I don't get this concept as according to me why waste these years by not living the way you want to, in waiting to get settled. I have now started buying stuff for my home, and got tv, washing machine, fridge, air conditioner , bed, almira, dressing table already, will add more stuff as I need themI have seen many people are afraid to live alone or some people just can't live alone, I am not one of them as I like living alone and I don't feel scared also.Here are some pics of my home :One with the old bedMy mini craft cornerFlowers to start your day offThis cute couple I bought recentlyWihen I bought my first bed coverA colorful painitingMy new bedVideo tour of my room ( with all the lightings )0:00-0:42
This is going to be the third time I'm mentioning my house (and my third changed house) but living alone comes with its fair share of perks.I have been living in Bangalore for 2+ years, and I have changed my house four times, earlier I use to live with three working women but their kleptomaniac behaviour, sense of superiority and entitlement, because I was youngest, was taking a toll on me.Then I had to move my last two houses because of the job change, and currently, I'm living in my small paradise. I live in 1600 Sq feet house to myself in near HSR, Bangalore. It is a 2BHK on a ground floor with my little personal garden (yet to maintain)Since I'm a Work from Home consultant, I don't need to go out and work, so I invested a little into a place where I can call both office and home.- Now the joyous part of living alone varies from person to person, Being a cleanliness freak, I use to keep my place tidy but was never appreciated for it, and sometimes people would make it dirty and never bother to clean-problem gets cleared because you fix it and only you ruin it.- It is easy to host family. A lot of my friends have mentioned how their flatmates are not okay with family visiting for a more extended period as it breaches the privacy of everyone.When you live alone you can call them for as long as you want, it has just been six months, but my mother stayed for two months and brother for another, and there were 0 hassles.You can host game nights, dates, etc. at your house without uncomfortable stares.-I get to arrange furniture and place the way I want with 0 say of people on the outside and in a fixed budget — also, arguments around who will take when we move out.-I can save myself from Splitwise embarrassment over small things, also not to remind someone to pay rent, water, electricity, wifi, groceries etc.-I can roam in my underpants all day long, I decide who is coming to my house, play loud music, sleep wherever I feel like and fill up fridge the way I want.Now, to clarify living alone doesn't mean that one is lonely. I have friends over; sometimes I stay over at friends place. I have always been someone who loves her privacy, so for me, it is essential.In the past I have lived with people be it boyfriend or flatmates and experience has not been good enough, I cannot dominate people into living the way I want, but I can always make a choice of separating my lifestyle from it, and it has worked out great for me.Here are a few pictures of my house:-My Living Hall2. My Study Area3. My office4. My Master Bedroom5. My love for Pride starts from my doorsteps6. View from my window every day7. This is my unmaintained garden8. Voila! my dirty kitchenTada!
I assume you are not asking about living alone in the wilderness - I wouldn't know anything about that - but about living alone with access to human society.When you made the decision to live alone (or when the decision was made for you) how did you feel? Did any part of you get excited about the idea?Did any of the possibilities listed by Kathleen Grace run through your mind? If not, and if all you could think of was about how sad or scary it was going to be, then perhaps it's not for you.That said, sometimes, one has to experience it to understand it. I think living alone is a luxury that not many people get to experience. Some tend to confuse it with being lonely, unloved, or antisocial. On the contrary, living alone, and therefore having the mind space to truly think free of distractions, can help you reach unexplored parts of your self and make deliberate strides towards self-actualization. (Ok, that sounds a bit like woowoo, but it's not!)Last, living alone does not preclude ever living with someone. It can be a stage in your life, it can be a scheduled break from living with someone, it can be a choice that you stick to until you come across someone(s) that you want to live with, or it can be a lifestyle choice for life. Whatever it is, I hope you learn to enjoy it.

What are the benefits of living alone?
Is it wise to live alone?
What does it feel like to live completely alone?
For me, I think the best thing in Bangalore is me living alone. I used to share a room with another girl in the initial days when I moved to Bangalore. But I needed peace. So, I saved money for 2 years and finally could rent a flat on my own. (In Bangalore it's a hell of a price to get a one BHK on rent that too for a single working woman )Why I find living alone is fun? joyous?I want my place spick and span. I hate dirt, filth, mosquitoes, flies, spiders etc. I am a very hygienic person and I clean my place every day. Most of my roommates I shared the room with didn't like this habit of mine. They thought I had a weird habit(I may have) but hey! What's wrong in being clean?NO DRAMA! And NO BULL CRAP. I remember my very last roommate once got drunk and started crying over her ex-bf. She almost ruined a good mood. Some of the other girls I shared the room with were even worse. Some would put the music on at late in the night, some would keep the alarm bells ringing without getting up and switching it off themselves and the most pathetic one: They would make their bed filthy and then use my pillows/bed/blankets.I don't like going out unless it's Durga Puja or my best friend is in the town. Not that am lazy but hey I get just two days offs after working for 10 hours each on 5 working days. I like taking rest, doing my chores, cooking myself some good healthy meals, washing my clothes.I decorate my room just the way I like it. I sometimes put on some fairy lights or some butterflies stickers on the wall. I play my favourite song on the speaker, open the window and enjoy the breeze. My flat’s not just a place to live but my ‘Aashiyana'My mom and dad visit me anytime they want. Earlier I always had to book a hotel room for them. But now when they visit me they stay with me, we cook and eat together and my mom always sends me to the office with a lunch box whenever she visits me. What could be more amazing?COMFORT! I can always wear an undie or a nightgown or anything I want. I don't have anybody to poke or pass comment. Sometimes I get up early around 6, make myself some tea and go for a walk, while on other days I get up late around 11 or 12 and watch series or just lie on the bed.These are some of the reasons I could really think of now.Some of the pictures of my place.Some of the meals I made :Edit: Thank you very much for your responses. I'm glad you guys liked my answer.Also, there's another point which I missed :8. Living alone is no doubt joyous. It's a responsibility too. It made me a responsible person. I was the same person who didn't even know how to boil an egg, learned cooking. All those years when I used to stay with my parents, I never ever did anything. Here I not only just learned cooking, started to do all the household chores that all the mothers do/have been doing. It's fun to be independent and live your life just the way you want. Even though I spend more money than my colleagues on accommodation, I don’t regret it. I feel living alone made me a better, sincere, disciplined, and responsible version of my older self.
Dear,Why do things appear different? What is it to be alone? What is aloneness? Does aloneness means ignoring the world? How would this be helpful for us?  The  more distracted the mind is; the more it believes in diversity, the  more it believes in different things to be different. Taking different  things, letting your mind be subjected to differences, is what is called  as chaos. Understand this clearly. Letting your mind become a victim of  differences, is what is called as chaos. A chaotic mind sees too many things and takes all of them to be independent of each other. The  forms may be different but the source is one. When you see that the  source alone exists, even though it manifests itself in a billion forms,  this is called Aloneness. The one who can see That alone in everything  and everybody, he is alone. That alone, only That. Nothing else. He  knows then that the existence is not divided. He knows that even though  the branches may be different, the twigs may be different, the leaves  may be different but the root is one, and the root alone is expressing  itself as the huge tree. This is Aloneness; the root alone exists.  Leaves will fall; even the branches will come and go. The root alone  really exists. This is Aloneness. How do you know that you are joyful? The climate of Joy is the absence of ambition and achievement. Joy is to retain one's health even in the middle of all kinds of diseases and diseased.For more clarity watch this video:For more discussions on this or related topics:Shri Prashant- Words into SilenceShri PrashantPrashant TripathiRD
Can an alone person be happy?
Dear friend,An alone person can be happy but generally that's not the case and the reason why you asked this question.Let's find out why we cannot be happy when alone with the help of this article from Acharya Prashant's blog: Words Into Silence“Why do we always require somebody’s company?”Even when there is somebody who is lying on the side of the road, let’s say an accident victim waiting to be helped, we wonder whether we are the first one or the only one who would be getting involved. We think so many times before putting our foot forward. In such situations too, we require the company of somebody else, why?This is just one particular incident where it becomes obvious, that we are so dependent on others. Such incidents only exemplify, bring forth to light that we are very very dependent. But, such dependence is not limited to these kinds of incidents. Kindly, do not think that in other general, day to day matters of life, we act independentlyThe mind is dependent all the time. But that dependence is subtle, so it doesn’t become obvious. But it becomes very obvious in such matters – you want to really do something and yet are unable to gather courage for it because nobody else is doing it. And then it becomes obvious. You would be missing the point, if you think that these events are special. These events are not special. These events only represent, what the mind always is; not in particular instances, always.Getting it?Look at this: You enter this hall and if you find that everybody is sitting on the back benches, on the chairs at the end of the hall, the rear end. You would find it quite difficult to simply come and occupy a front seat, wont you? But if you enter an empty hall than, you won’t have problem sitting on any particular chair, right?Do you see the comparison and what it brings out? You enter this hall and you find that everybody is sitting there, at the back, you will find it very difficult to sit all by yourself in the front, right? Even if the others do not say anything to you, and if they do not pass any comments, even if they are not at all bothered about you, yet it would become very difficult for you because, we are always looking for social sanction.There is hardly anything within most of us, which is really independent. Even the slightest, smallest, most routine actions happen with an eye on what the others might be thinking or saying.Look at our choice of clothes. A very general matter but very few people buy clothes purely out of their consideration for themselves. Most of us wonder, how would I look in these clothes? Now, look to whom? Others. How would I look to others when I wear this? And it is such a stupid thing. The other who is looking at you surely knows that this is just a piece of clothing, a textile product; it’s not you. And yet you are so concerned.If you were to speak to a crowd or let’s say come to this podium, your anxiety levels would be proportional to the number of students, the strength of the audience in this hall; others. What is the weight of the others? What is the mass and measure of the others? And if by any chance, the others are not kind to you, and just before you start speaking somebody makes a rude comment, or somebody just laughs or giggles, then you know how difficult it becomes for us, right?Now, the fellow has not even heard you. You haven’t yet started speaking and he might be giggling out of his some personal occupation, may be his neighbor has just whispered a small joke to him. So, his smiles has nothing to do with you. But, the moment you see audience smiling, you start sweating. And remember you still haven’t uttered a word. So, you very well know that even if they are judging, they couldn’t be judging what you have come there to do, because you haven’t started doing that.Every breath that we take, every word that we utter, every step that we take is a step steeped in slavery. We do not do anything independently, just anything. It’s impossible for us.I was in campus, I would see one of my batch mates keenly interested in a girl, in the junior year. And all the symptoms of attraction, and occupation of mind and all that happens in those years, they were all there. And I was seeing it since a few weeks. So, one day I went to him and I said, “What’s going on? It’s all obvious now but tell to me, what’s going on?” He said, “No, nothing, nothing is going on.” I said, “Now, will you hide it from me and don’t you know that I know.”He said, “I’m not very sure. So, let me just finalize it and then I will reveal everything. Pakka nahi hai(I’m not sure).” I said, “If it is love then, how can you not be sure about it? And if you are not sure about it than, surely it is not that.”He said, “No, no. it is quite certain yet not fully certain. I’m trying to ascertain it.” I said, “I don’t know what you mean but, fine, go ahead.” He said, “Just a little bit of formalities left. Let me complete it.”So, after 2-3 weeks one day he comes rushing, overflowing with happiness, bubbling. So I ask him, “Yes?” He says, “Now, I am fully sure. No doubts at all. Complete certainty.” I said, “How did that happen? Did some messenger from the heavens descend in the morning? Or you performed some litmus test or something? From where did you suddenly get so much of clarity?” He said, “No, no. I had actually sent just a few friends to her city and they have found out her caste, her sub caste, her economic status and gently we have also probed her parents and they are okay. And in between, I have been calling my parents as well, and I have found out what kind of demands they will have, including financial demands. And the girl’s family, I see, would be prepare to meet all those demands. So, now I am fully certain that I am mad in love. Now I know very well that we are made for each other. It is love at first sight. It is love without sight. Even before seeing her I knew that my soul has been thirsty only for this kind of a woman.”They are, in your social language, happily married now and have a happy family; very very loving family. So dependent we are, we can’t even love freely. Even in love, we first have to look around to seek permission – seek permission of religion, of caste, of parents, society, the neighbor, the neighbor’s dog, everybody must agree and if they don’t agree than, we dare not go ahead. Such deep dependence.Start by looking at small matters in daily life. If you want to just have a small walk in the night, do you really require to have somebody with you? And if you cannot walk by yourself then it’s not a small matter, it’s a symptom of a deep disease.There were times when I was in college, when I would go to watch movies by myself; alone. It was no rule for me, I could go with friends as well. But if good company wasn’t available, I had no problems with simply going and watching a movie by myself. And people would wonder, “How can you do this?” Some would be actually horrified, “You watched a movie with nobody?”What? Do you go to watch the movie or do you go to watch your neighbor? What do you mean by, “You watched the movie with nobody?” What will the somebody do? What will the somebody do, both of us are supposed to watch the movie right?But how difficult it is for us, to even watch a movie by ourselves; terrifying, right? In a movie theater with nobody by your side, “Oh my God! such a loner, miserable condition; all alone.” Those who cannot do these small things, being with themselves, how will they do anything significant, meaningful by themselves? You cannot watch a movie by yourself, how will you take your life decisions by yourself? And there is work, and there is a life to be lived, and there are directions to be decided, and there is love, there is marriage; decisions upon decisions.You cannot buy a shirt without considering what aunt is going to say, how will you chose a job without considering what aunt will say? Do you see that this is a condition of great helplessness? And it’s is not because you love aunt, that you are so dependent upon her.When you are dependent upon somebody, it is violence, you could not be loving that person. There too the relationship is of hatred. No slave ever loves his master, how can you love somebody who has enslaved you? How can you love somebody who has taken away your freedom? So all around we are caught in a web of slavery. And a very peculiar aspect of this is that those from whom we seek sanction, they are not strangers — they are strangers as well — but mostly they are the people we claim to be intimate with.Continue with the example of the podium. When you come here on the podium and you start trembling, do you realize who is it that you are afraid of? These are not strangers sitting here. These are people you know, and some of you might be having their best friends in this crowd and yet you find yourself shivering; trembling. That is the nature of our relationship.The closer somebody is to me, the more dependent I’m on that person and hence, closeness is directly proportional to the violence in relationship.You don’t feel bad when a stranger on the road says something to you, you do feel bad but you can kind of tolerate it. But when people within your circle make a comment upon you than, your self-worth is destroyed.The world might be calling you a fatso, you can manage to ignore it. But your boyfriend comes and says, “You are becoming sphere like, rotund, you are gone, you collapse and you will start hating the fellow; the boyfriend is gone. From where did this hatred come? It does not come from nowhere, it was always there; it only got expressed.You were always dependent on him and when you are dependent on somebody remember, I repeat you cannot love that fellow.Love happens only in freedom. It is a very free bird, it does not like cages and freedom we know not.So many of you gave these questions yesterday upon the forum, its good I have them in front of me. I know some of you won’t be able to speak here because there are now hundreds of you here, is that not so? After every Samvaad session, we have some of you stay back and then they open up, then they speak and I ask them, what happened in those 2 hrs? Why don’t you speak then? And all they can do is drop their heads.Unnecessarily ashamed. We didn’t speak then because there were so many others present. Even in asking questions you are dependent on others. So you cannot speak because there are others and there are some who would speak precisely because there are others. If I speak right now, it’s a good opportunity to impress a large audience, so why am I speaking? Because there are others here.We won’t be, we want to clearly say ‘I’. This ‘I’ has become very clouded, in fact it is nowhere to be seen. Our ‘I’ really does not exists, instead we have a fake ‘I’ which is just a collection of images from the world. We are so full of the world, that there is no ‘I’ness left within us. The world is dominating our mind, it has totally filled us up. It’s present in our very cell – the world; the world; the world. Our very sense of existence that ‘I am’ comes from the world. And that’s why Praveen, we are so dependent and so hungry for company.We are hungry for company because we are what the world is giving to us. So, if the world becomes absent then there is a danger that we will no more be there. Who am I? Who am I? Bits and pieces collected from the world. So, take the world away and do I exist? I don’t. So, I always need company and I always need validation, sanction, approval.But the thing is that if everything is coming from the world, then you anyway don’t exist. So, it’s such a poor attempt. It’s such a defeated attempt to live with an ‘I’ upon the world; to live as a function of all the forces and the voices and the faces around you. It’s such non-living, most people are non-living creatures. They don’t have a central crystal within them. They are just a little bit of here, a little bit of there, some kind of a pot puree, khichdi.So, you interview somebody and the fellow would have written in his CV, I am proud of my leadership qualities. What’s your strength? “My leadership qualities.” And you ask him how do you know that you have leadership qualities and soon you would find him saying that, “Well my friends and everybody else has been telling me that I have good leadership qualities, that’s how I know I have leadership qualities.” Now, this is a leader, this is a leader who knows himself to be a leader because others told him that you are a leader. Now who is leading whom? Are you leading or are you being lead?L: Lead.AP: There is nothing about us that is our own. And that’s why we seek company. The man who has found even a trace of that ‘I’ness, will not be desperate for company. When he will have company, he would be alright and when he won’t have company, then too he would be alright. He won’t start feeling out of breath. Oh my god, half an hour to kill and nobody to talk to, give me my phone, where is Facebook? Or let me just call up someone and indulge in meaningless chatter. And why did I call, because I am so uncomfortable with myself.You don’t like yourself, you are uncomfortable with yourself and you expect others to like you. You do not like your own company, right? You can’t live with yourself but you expect that others will like you. What kind of expectation is this?The best relationships are not born out of loneliness. A healthy relationship is born out of a sense of completion. It is not a parasitic relationship. “I feel incomplete, you feel incomplete, so let’s come together and together we will feel complete.” As if two beggars coming together will become millionaire.Imagine two beggars are begging each other, hoping to become millionaires. That’s how our relationships are.A healthy relationship says, “I am related to you in my completeness. I am related to you precisely because there is something that I can now give, I am not begging” And then there is no violence in that relationship. And then things like possessiveness, jealousy, insecurity, they are not there. The man who longs for company would surely be possessive, jealous, insecure and the rest of it that goes along, the entire package.We have been trained in a way, which has told us only of our short comings – sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. Since birth, we have only been told what we need to acquire. That’s what our teachers have been telling us, right? Now, you must learn this, “Students tomorrow you must prepare this chapter, now you are graduating to this class, now you are moving from bachelors to master program.” So, there is more and more to acquire. And acquisition means deficiency.So in a way the system around us has been trying to help us, but in helping us it has been constantly telling us of our deficiency – “This is what you do not know? This is what you do not know? This is how you are inadequate?”Nobody has ever told us of what we know. We have been told of what we do not have, but we have never been told of that which we have. We have been told a lot of what we need to acquire, but nobody told us of that which we do not need to acquire – That which is centrally important, that which not be acquired and which cannot be taken away. So, this mind is full of thoughts of acquiring, of the world because all acquiring happens from the world, you get from the world.Mind is dominated by the world – completely full of the world, completely full of the world and completely full of a sense of short coming, “There is something missing; there is something missing; there is something missing and what is missing can be supplied by the world. So, let me have this person in my life, let me have more money in my life, let me have a few more degrees in my life, let me have a better job in my life, let me have a bigger car and a bigger house in my life, all these are companies.Praveen, when you said that we always want a company; company is not limited to human beings. We want something in life, which may be a person or a thing, any object, we want it in life. We want it in life because we have been trained about all that which is missing. This is missing, that is missing, kindly get it otherwise you will remain incomplete. You need to find out, figure out, you are intelligent beings, ‘Do you really, desperately require all that you crave so much for?’ And what does that craving give you? Do you really feel good being dependent? Do you really enjoy suffering? Is frustration so necessary? Must we live like a thirsty fish, feeling bad and sad, with occasional bursts of hope in between?And obviously,When you don’t feel good about yourself, then you have a lot of hope.Hope is an indicator that things are terribly wrong.When you see that this craze for being surrounded, this craze for company is just a heavy load on your head, then you want to give it up. Then you will say, “I don’t want any more of it, I am alright; I don’t want company.” When you look at the small things in life and you see what it has come to, then you don’t want things.I was travelling with an old acquaintance, so he tells the driver — we were in the car — so he tells the driver, “Please switch on the radio.” Now, it’s my driver, so he knows a little about things, so he asks him, “What you want to hear, which particular lecture, what kind of music?” He said, “No no, just the radio, no CD, nothing, just the radio.” Driver says, “Alright sir which channel – an AM or FM?” He says, “Anything, just the radio.”He says, “Sir, anything?” The driver had not heard anything like this from me ever. So, the man says, “Just anything, something should be on, I cannot tolerate silence, give me something, something should be on.”Such is the depth of our disease. We cannot live in silence, we require something to be there. So, some idiotic radio jockey would be just blabbering something but that is alright. “Some sound is there and that sound is giving me comfort. Oh, I am not lonely, I am not lonely, somebody is there, somebody is saying something, something is going on.” Have you noticed this?We require something to be on. And you need to be attentive to these small things. You go to houses and you finds sometimes the television is on for twenty hours a day. Now, the lady in the house is not even watching the TV, she is in the kitchen or busy with her miscellaneous chores, but the TV is?L: On.AP: On. You ask her, “What is there in the TV? Which particular channel, which program?” She won’t be able to tell. But if you switch off the TV, she will immediately say, “No, no switch it on, switch it on. Something must be going on, otherwise I feel fearful; silence kills me.”A man or a woman, who cannot live in silence, is mentally diseased.Do you understand disease? Dis Ease – a sense of dis ease, the one who is not comfortable.Become attentive to these small things and then you will see that you do not need the world to be so heavy upon you.In this realization, there is freedom from the world. Just be attentive to what you are doing twenty four hours a day; you are intelligent. The moment you are attentive, you are intelligent.And,In intelligence, lies freedom
Can an alone person be happy?
Scenario 1 -Aikant (in School) was a shy introvert guy, a loner. He had two friends though. Let's call them F1 & F2.Conversation between F1 & F2 goes like this;F1 to F2 : Why Aikant is so weird? He never calls us, not even on occasions/festivals. Is he arrogant or thinks we're unworthy to be his friends?F2 to F1 : Yes, truly said. He never ever initiates a conversation. He always keeps a grin on his face that looks so evil & fake. Let him suffer in isolation. We'd never including him in our group.Meanwhile, Aikant finished his reading and about to move forward to talk to F1 & F2. But, he saw them indulged in chit-chat and chose not to disturb them. He opened his puzzle book and started solving it. He found solving those puzzles easier than conversating with friends. He was at peace while F1 & F2 had found another topic about another person to discuss.Scenario 2 -Aikant ( in college) had grown up to become a humble guy with clear thoughts & expressions. He talked to people only when it was necessary. He scored decent GPA and enjoyed cool lifestyle at college. He met two of his friends here. Let's call them F3 & F4.F3 & F4 while talking about Aikant ;F3 to F4 : Why Aikant is so boring? He never chills out with us. Either I see him in library or in his room. Perhaps, he's really opinionated about himself and thinks world revolves around him.F4 to F3 : Exactly my point. Perhaps he thinks that he's the only smart here. Well ignore that poor guy. Let's have beer tonight and avoid calling him to sit with us. He'll make our night really boring.Meanwhile, Aikant noticing F3 & F4 around, wanted to stop & say 'Hi'. But as soon as he saw them talking, he changed his mind, thinking not to disturb them in their private conversation. He walked away peacefully smoking his cigarette.Scenario 3 -Aikant (in profession) happen to be a hard-working, unsociable and sincere guy. He had colleagues at his workplace whom he considered his friend. Let's call them C1 & C2.Conversation between C1 & C2;C1 to C2 : Aikant never mix up with us in the office. Always keep working at his desk. I guess either he shows off or he's incompetent and never finishes off his work on time. He speaks on occasions to impress the boss and get his increments regularly.C2 to C1 : Yes, indeed. He might be confidante of our boss and stays late in the office to keep his eyes upon other employees. He's a good flatterer. By the way I have invited everyone but him today, on my son's first birthday. I can't bear this sinister at such an auspicious occasion. (Both laughs)Meanwhile, Aikant leaving for home, stops and said , “ Hey C2! I've heard today is your son's first birthday. Happy birthday to him. God bless.” And he moved forward to his home happily.Could you see the pattern in all the 3 scenarios?Aikant ( all alone) was meant to be lonely. He was never afraid of it. He accepted it gracefully. While his friends/ colleagues were busy discussing him , he made peace with himself. He didn't care what people may think of him or whether they liked him or not. He simply was lonely. It was just as simple.He grew his skills day by day while making people discuss about him , thus making their life busy.Be like Aikant. Make peace with yourself. And happiness will come your way. :)
It’s definitely joyous. It was painful for me to adjust and compromise with roommates in hostels/PGs.  I chose to live alone because I wanted to do exactly what I want, like: Waking up and taking a bath whenever I want to as there is no one to share my bathroom with.Working late without any disturbances if a deadline has to be met.Roaming around in under pants if I haven’t done the laundry.Free from following the standard menu of the house which I am not fond of.Not spending those extra 4000 rupees for a hotel when my parents come over to attend a relatives wedding.Not wanting to put that fake smile on when some random guy visits my roommate.Saving the embarrassment on turning down a roommate's request to drop her at the station while working from home.Not becoming victim to a new tv series my roommates suddenly glues to.Living alone doesn’t mean that I am unfriendly, depressed, rebellious or miserable. It simply means that I respect my own and others space and freedom. It’s just that I want to avoid those irritating discussions on why the dustbin was not cleared? Whose turn is to pay for the water can? Why was the light left on? Why fish, which makes the kitchen smelly, was cooked? Why was the fridge not loaded? Etc.  While living with roommates at least 90% of the time was spent on discussions regarding fashion, celebrities, ex-boyfriends and men. I would rather catch up with my friends for a movie or at a coffee shop or a weekend getaway where we can actually spend some quality time together.It’s true that when living alone we feel lonely sometime, but there are many people who live with others and still trapped with the feeling of solitude.  Of course there are financial implications when the expenses are not shared. I have made financial sacrifices like, using public transports; packing lunch to work; only watching well-acclaimed movies instead of all friday releases; visiting home once in a month instead of every week. But the feeling of listening to 80s Ilayaraja and 90s Rahman on full volume while deep frying your favourite fish; without anyone being annoyed by the choice of music and a smelly kitchen is truly awesome. Living alone can be joyous!

I don't really know, since I missed by 4".  But the late Manute Bol, once was asked the principal advantage and disadvantage said something very much like, "The principal advantage, you can see (he was wearing an NBA uniform at the time)".  The principal disadvantage is unrealistic expectations."He was from the Sudan, and I seem to remember the Dinka tribe.  He has the questionable "distinction" of being the only NBA player ever to have killed a lion with a spear.  They did things a little differently then, and the "dowry" he paid for his wife was 80 cows. His son, named Bol Bol, is 6'10" and in the 7th grade.  He is a good shooter and ball handler, as well as being just a bit taller than his classmates. His father was a good (though not extraordinary) 3-point shooter, which for some reason surprised many people.  People have (or at least had, for a very long time), the expectation that a very tall player would not be a good shooter from longer distances.  He was a 56% free throw shooter, and was always among the leaders in blocked shots (and twice led the league) despite playing comparatively few minutes.  His minutes were limited because of his weight (I've seen it given anywhere between 175 and 225 lbs.)An interesting statistic, according to the Bureau of the Census: only 5% of U.S. men are 6'2" or taller.  Men over 6'6", statistically, virtually do not exist Page on census.gov

As a 7ft Frisian Dutchman, my height is abnormal, but not too weird. A lot of people grow to be 2m tall here.I can sum it up like this: I can never choose to not stand out.And when you go out, there are a lot of Davids and Napoleons that feel like they got their duck stepped on.People hand you leadership; so you best take it, or be mocked.It's a bit of a struggle, just being a grown boy in a big body, while everybody thinks and assumes you are awesome.It's funny; everybody wants to be different, but those that stand out, get mocked.But the benefits are obvious. Being tall you stand out and are never short of conversation (o how I loathe talking about my height, but every single person you meet seems to think they are so clever for pointing out your height), easily the centre of a party and don't have to be bored.People always remember you, comes in handy with calling them up for favors/jobs.Intimidation factor: people never cut in line when I am around; one grim stare and they tuck their tail.Look amazing with a full beardAddendum: can grow a good beardIf you look good and are still nimble: all the superfluous chicas.SportsFuck any transportation though
As a 7"9 tennage hulk, I can easily answer this. It's LIT. People are always commenting on you, how strong you look. If you workout, your muscles are enormous too. Pecs big enough for a friend to sit on, abs big enough to hide stuff between them, biceps almost 3 feet thick, legs 5 times thicker than most people. So cool.

Living alone can be hell or heaven depending on your personality type. For me, it was a step ahead of heaven.Last year, I lived alone for 3 months and this was in a foreign country in a 5 bedroom house. I locked up all rooms except mine. All I used was my room, a bathroom and a kitchen.Why it was easy:I could cook whatever I wanted, well not whatever but however I wanted it. I like the extra spice and extra detailing to the cooking. Weekends were dedicated to cooking and groceries.I bought a bike and it served me well for the grocery shopping. When I went grocery shopping alone for the first time in my life, I picked just processed, preserved, unhealthy stuff. My mom almost had a panic attack when she saw a picture of my glorious shopping. I gradually moved to the fruits, vegetables and natural foods section and I eradicated the possibility of unconsciously killing myself.Also, with the bike, I explored a minimum of five temples, two buddhist monasteries and two libraries. Only with a bike and a bus pass! It’s so easy to go wherever you want when no one is rolling their eyes every time you want to go to the temple or the library.Not caring a damn about what I’m wearing. I could wear an ancient yet favorite T-shirt from the days of the Indus valley civilization or I could wear a snug, personally faded, torn jeans pant and nobody would bat an eye.Talking of clothes, I never retrieved clothes from the dryer to fold them and put them into the closet, I never even used the laundry basket to put used clothes. This is how it was for three months - put in dirty clothes into the washer, wait till it is filled with dirty clothes, wash, transfer all clothes to dryer, pick one cloth everyday from the dryer and wear it. Once all clothes in the dryer are finished, repeat. Ah! sweet life.Sing. You have no idea how nice it is to sing for yourself. Any song…any damn song and anywhere in the house. I sang in the shower, I sang while I cooked, I sang while I got ready…you name it. I belted innumerable songs! I shuffled, mixed and remixed better than most music players ;)Bye bye headphones. When you’re the only person in the house, why use the headphones? I played songs, audio books and movies in full volume…nobody to complain.What was tough at first but then became easy:Cooking was definitely tough at first but then it soon became an art and I enjoyed doing it.There is a glass door to one of the rooms. Every time I walked by it, my reflection moved along with me and for 3.635 milli seconds, before I knew that it’s my own reflection, I freaked out; I froze the first time! This happened for almost a week and then my system learnt that it’s alright.Horror movies were a complete no no during the first two-three weeks. They were totally fine after some time. I watched Conjuring, Black Water and Paranormal activity at night and slept like a baby.My schedule:Wake up at 5:30 AM. Take a bath and play Vishnu Sahasranama (Sanskrit Shloka) and other daily shlokas and mantras right after getting out of the bathroom.Eat a fruit/vegetable and make some easy breakfast and pack light snacks.Leave home at 6:30 AM to attend a 7:30 AM class. Bike till the bus stop and get into the bus.12:30 PM the class done. Get into a bus back home.There was an Indian restaurant near the place where I locked my bike. I used to buy some sambar/rasam/dal if I didn’t feel like cooking that day.Bike back home and eat lunch.Rest/write/watch a movie/read a book/solve a jigsaw puzzle till 3:00 PM.Study till 6:00 PM.Head to the park for a jog/bike/do yoga till 7:30 PM.Make dinner or just finish up what was done for lunch. Eat at 8:00 PMRead something while dozing off by 10:00–10:30 PM.Repeat.Like I said, special dishes, special destinations and special activities like meditation classes and retreats were dedicated to weekends.My accomplishments in three months of peaceful solitude:Read 11 books - reread Krishna: The Man and His Philosophy, A Scientist’s Search for Truth, reread Angels and Demons, reread Lost Symbol, reread Deception Point, Eat Pray Love, Briefer History of Time, The Hidden Reality, Take it Easy, Anatomy and Physiology for Nurses and 3 mistakes of my life. I still regret reading the last one.Practised music - my mom loves me a bit more for this one :DLearnt cooking while learning the difference between two types of yellow grams - toor dal and chana dal. Don’t judge me. See it for yourself, it is tough to differentiate!Understood that I consume normal amounts of salt and cooking oil. Since I lived alone, I knew exactly how much salt and cooking oil I consumed in a day. Mom and dad were happy about my diet. Mind you, my dad is a Yoga professor, it is tough to satisfy him!Solved a 2000 piece (first pic) and a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle.Cinque Terre, Italy painting - Buffalo Games:Starry Night, Vincent Van Gogh - EuroGraphics:Would I do this being-alone thing again? Hell yeah, without a doubt!I loved my company. I was alone but I wasn’t lonely even for a single moment. There was not one moment of boredom, remorse or conflict. I was in love and I did not need anyone to love. It’s ok if you don’t get it now. You’ll get it when you have my mental maturity ;)Remember, if you cannot live with yourself, you cannot live with anyone else. The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it is not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of the other person—without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other.- Osho
What does it feel like to live completely alone?
What is it like to live alone for the first time in your life?
Can living alone ever be joyous?
Is it wise to live alone?
Do you prefer to live alone? Why or why not?
I have been living alone since 2006. It’s a long period. Although, there were times when for few weeks, I was with others and then again alone and it continued. But at the most, I have been alone. Made all decisions alone. Gone through everything alone.Therefore, I can give an insight to how is it like to live alone.I will share my current routine and then give my conclusions to which many of you may disagree.Here we go,I get up at 5 or 6 depending on either it’s summer or winter time.I do worship to Almighty. (For some of you maybe it’s surprising but Yes, I really do)I go for a short morning walk.I prepare my breakfast at 8 or maybe even late.My office is 300m away from my home. I, don’t go to office everyday. My employees are working there according to their timetables. There are cameras installed everywhere and I can view almost every activity on my laptop or mobile. If I have to attend important meeting or discuss some issues with employees, I do visit my office for few hours. But most of the time, I monitor them from home. This gives me more time alone.I cook my lunch at 13–00 or maybe at 14–00. Since, I live alone, I am free to choose whatever I like.If I need to go for some shopping or groceries, I usually do it after lunch.I go to gym in the evening, sometimes I don’t go to gym. I may also go for swimming. Sometimes I go for a walk. The park is 100m away from home. No big deal.After workout, I prepare my dinner. Sometimes, I invite my friends over and gossip in the weekend. Sometimes, I go out with them.Sometimes I watch movie alone. If its a good comedy e-g: Ruby and Quentin, I do laugh a lot. I like it.What else? If I feel sleepy, I go to bed early. If not, I stay online and do my stuff.Sometimes, I even don’t speak to anybody for the whole day. (But recently, I got into a relationship and I’m losing my privacy and free time. Let’s see, how it goes this time.)Below is the graphic version of how I live alone:I can cook whatever I like and I can wear whatever I want.That’s now, I’m writing my answer on Quora:You have now enough idea, how it is like to live alone for some people.I would now like to mention the advantages of living alone (or loneliness), which I personally observed.I think each of us sometimes just need to be alone.1- Loneliness purifies our consciousness. During the day, we receive a lot of different information from the media, friends, colleagues and loved ones. We don’t notice how it starts to negatively affect our life. Therefore, sometimes you just need to think about everything in a quiet and peaceful place, where no one will disturb you.2. Creativity also needs silence and tranquility. When we are alone and do not specifically think about anything, our imagination gets freedom and this moment is capable of giving birth to truly beautiful ideas.3. Loneliness helps to strengthen confidence in something. We listen to our inner voice, we weigh the pros and cons on the basis of our own experience, and this is much more important than the opinions of others.4. We become more independent. When we are left alone, we can dream and create goals based on our dreams, which allow us to develop and grow independently.5. Loneliness aggravates perception. Away from the emotions and experiences of the outside world, it is much easier to draw the right conclusions or to take another look at the problem.6. It is necessary to be a little alone to reduce stress and anxiety. This helps to bring thoughts back to normal after a busy day.7. The best way to get to know yourself is to take a short break from communication with others. It will help to find what is really important to us, and set priorities.8. The best way to increase productivity is to be alone to clarify your thoughts, to put your dreams in order and put everything in order. Make strategies to achieve your targets.9- . Loneliness strengthens relationships. Believe it or not, our close people do not need our constant attention. When we have time to understand and appreciate ourselves, we are able to better understand and appreciate others.The list goes on… But I would better stop here.All the best.Edit:Inbox and comment section is so curious of who clicked these pics.- I have mentioned that recently I got into a relationship … Her classes were off yesterday and she came here to have a lunch together. So, she clicked these pictures.

8 months ago, I hit rock bottom. Life seemed unfair. I battled sadness and depression for 4 months. And I reached the ‘Fuck-this!-I’m-out’ moment and chose isolation.I quit my job. I came back home. I changed my phone number. And I cut off every possible acquaintance of mine. In few weeks, I moved out of my home and started living alone.Alone in its truest sense. No friends. No connections. No social media. As a matter of fact, most of my friends have no idea what happened to me.I was on Instagram. I was addicted to endless stalking of what my friends did over the weekend.One day, I had realisations[1]. I quit Instagram. I deactivated it. I haven’t gone back until now. I didn’t use WhatsApp too. I was hurt. And I wanted to deal with it alone.But boredom was my biggest enemy. I had to find alternatives to kill my spare time. I remembered Quora. I started writing.One of my anonymous answers went insanely viral. And suddenly people were appreciating my writing skills. Strangers over the internet were kind enough to spare their time to listen to what I had to say.That was kinder than most of the people in my life. I was and still am thankful for their generosity. I have been writing ever since. Writing is my escape now.Outcome 1: Started writing consistently. Developed hobby #1.I never even learnt to make coffee because I was scared my mom would make me prepare coffee every time for her.Now when I started to live alone, I started cooking. The first day, I called up my mom and she told me the recipe over the phone. I cooked. It was the most delicious sambar I ever had.I haven’t stopped cooking until now. I am passionate about it now.Outcome 2: Found out cooking can be fun. Developed hobby #2.Quora was not the only platform that I use to kill my boredom. I started using Reddit, Tumblr, Medium, Pinterest, Duolingo, Curiosity, The Guardian, Quizup, TED talks and I started reading articles over Pocket.As you notice, all of these platforms aren’t the primary choices of my friends. So, no one will find me here.If I am wasting my time endlessly scrolling through my phone screen then why not gain some knowledge and be productive, right?Every app that I said above builds my character and my personality.I don’t have to look at the food my friends ate last night or the pubs they danced this evening.Outcome 3: I am spending time productively by reading. Developed hobby #3.I started doing Yoga. My mind was a mess. And Yoga saved me. I got addicted to it because the peacefulness that I experience after doing it was priceless.Pro tip: If someone is going through depression, please start doing Yoga. Take a class in Udemy and just start it right away. You will find peace.Outcome 4: I do Yoga. Developed hobby #4. (Hobby because I do it for the joy of doing it and I can kill two hours every day.)After I isolated myself I have met strangers over the internet (Quora). Some have inspired me in the ways even they couldn't even imagine. I’m ever thankful to them.There is joy when you know a stranger gives you time, reads your content and appreciates you. I don’t know any of these strangers completely. In fact, I don’t know them at all. I don’t wanna know either.Strangers with good intentions feel a lot closer than friends who treat you like shit. This has been my motto. And hence the isolation.I am a Ghost now. Not many know what happened to me. I just hope everybody stays ignorant of Quora and never find me here.I talked about the positive side of my isolation. There is a dark side too.Sometimes I feel lonely. I feel like talking to someone about it. And I realise there’s none. At that moment, the feeling is the worst. Those nights, I have cried. I have had sleepless nights, not understanding why me? There is a war going on in my mind about my personality. It might end up affecting me psychologically.I’m doing better now. I am getting used to being alone because I chose this isolation. I have explored myself and my life is better than before. But there is a void. The void created by the people I cared a lot.If you are taking someone for granted in life, then don’t! Karma is a bitch and it will come right back at you.If you are being taken for granted then don’t be in that toxic relationship. Leave. You will suffer. You will be depressed. But the other person doesn’t deserve the time and effort you put into sustaining that relationship.Never leave your self-respect.–HXFootnotes[1] The worth by Raghavendra V on The Hunting Story!
I got married in December 2016 and moved to states with my husband. I was in US for 1.5 years and life was going pretty well until one fine day I realised that I can’t let my career suffer for the sake of living in America. I was on H4 visa (dependent) in which spouse is not allowed to work.So, the career oriented and independent woman soul in me woke up one day & took the charge. After having my husband’s consent I decided to move back to India alone for a while till we get a clear picture about trump moods and green card of course.My sleepless nights started with searching job on linked in & Naukri, because of huge time difference I had to stay up till late night to attend VC interviews. I didn’t want to miss any opportunity as I had a career gap of 1.5 years.By God's grace I got myself a job within 15 days of my stay in India (excluding my late night VC interviews in US). Now the real challenge was waiting ahead, of setting everything from scratch all over again.Earlier my husband was a helping hand in US. But here I was all alone managing everything from searching a house for rent, find a domestic help, buying household stuff, furniture, I had to do all alone.I had moved to Bangalore and rented a flat in BTM, where you only get independent buildings with no lift. My flat is on 4th floor and you can imagine how would it be without lift. I have to climb the stairs 3–4 times a day sometimes, because from throwing trash, buying grocery & going for work all requires me to step out of my house.Few months went by until I got settled, another trauma was waiting for me. After few months I caught my maid stealing money from my wallet so my last resort of some help in household work is also gone. Now like a wonder woman I am working, cleaning dishes, mopping the floor and cook for my self. Yes I know I don’t need gym after that.Life is tough sometimes once you start living alone especially after marriage but living alone independently has its own perks.I have decorated my house as per my whims & fancies with lots of pictures of our memories together.I have the whole bed to myself.I get lot of gifts from my husband time to time just to bring smile on my face after so much hard work I do.I can call my friends anytime for night out.I can wear anything I want, there is no one to judge me. I get enough ME time to do some self introspection.I can cook any random dishes.I had almost forgotten how its like to live alone. I have become more independent. I have started saving money again and done some investments. Living alone has given me a different perspective of life. I have become more cautious and mature.And most importantly, I know his importance in my life now. Its been more than a year we are living away carrying on with our jobs in different countries and hoping to live together again very soon.

I lived alone for 1 year in a studio flat at Koramangala, Bangalore. It was on the fourth floor. With no lift.I used to live in so much peace. I had lived in a hostel before that with 2 roommates and a shared toilet. I have lived through “Hair clogging the drain", “thats my table, dont keep your books on mine", or “I can't sleep without the fan sound, even if it is freezing cold" situations. So it was a big relief for me.But I was 22 at the time I took that decision. The flat was affordable, just 6.5K a month. Thats the price of a 3-sharing PG. So I moved in the flat. Even though I had to climb till the fourth floor, I did.It was very peaceful. A dream house I must say. I had all the time in the world to stay quiet and stare into the sky. The roof was right outside my door, a pretty chilled place to hangout. I could keep the room tidy my way. I could mess it up my way.I bought an induction cooker for preparing food. The water was free. I applied for TV cable. The landlords had given me a TV, an RO filter and a bed with it. Nice people.…Cut to 6 months. I was severely ill.I was staying alone. My parents, friends, well wishers kept calling me and telling me to visit a doctor. I wasn't strong enough to get out of bed. And when I did, I imagined going down the four floors, visiting the doctor who is just by the block, and then return, just to climb the four floors again!I fell back on the bed.My landlady, thankfully, paid a friendly visit. She saw my situations and brought me food and medicines immediately.…Eight months.Company wasn’t paying me enough to manage my expenses. Nor was I getting time to cook food at night. All my money goes in restaurants. I stop paying the TV bills.…10 months.I am unable to take care of the room alone. I can't afford a maid servant who could clean the room. And my health detoriates due to job pressure. I soon begin to regret my decision of staying alone.…12 months.My room looks nasty. I look like a mental patient. I decide to clean the room, and spend three days washing and dusting. I fall sick again. No one to take me to the hospital.My landlords have a relative come from Delhi for higher studies. They politely ask me to move out.I happily move out, find a PG where there's wi-fi, TV, electricity, food etc bills covered in the same 6.5K rent. Only compromise: back to the “drain's clogged”, “my bed”, “don't switch off the fan” drama.But, the same roommates took me to the hospital when I caught Dengue. They even paid my first hospital bill without letting me know. They would visit me twice a day and bring me fruits and juices and soups.At times you need people. You can live alone, yes. But only to an extent. In the longer run its someone you need to look after your little needs. Someone who could bring you a glass of water when you are ill. Someone who could take care of the house once in a while. Someone who could laugh at your jokes, or give you a shoulder to cry. Someone who could share your dinner table and discuss the fun things they did.Yes. We all need someone sometimes.And whats the price?To let go of those little annoying things that bother you. Of course that doesn't apply to totally uncompromising narcissistic bigots, but most people you meet in life will be nice.
What it is like to live alone?
Answering to my own question.What it is like to live alone?Almost one year back in November. I shifted to Gurgaon and as I always enjoyed my own company.I thought of living alone.Flashback:I had pretty cool life in Mumbai. Amazing roommates and those same guys as colleagues.God was making up for my dull and introvert college life.We, being roommates enjoyed a lot. I know it’s fad to call brothers to your friends but we were brothers.I had some amazing colleagues besides these two stupidos (roommates). I loved being there. Loved my work and my after-work-life.Although I always wanted to live alone and walk naked sipping coffee. I wanted to do this but leaving this amazing thing going on wasn’t easy and couldn’t have done it if I wasn’t shifting to whole new city. I made it solid for myself that I need to do this.A decision:So when in Nov’15 when I came here I started living alone.Even after living a week I wasn’t sure about this decision.I didn’t find any sense in walking naked in the room. Days were like doubled their times.I started getting confused about my decision so I put this question on Quora and within 2–3 days I got some really amazing answers.Few of them are,Charu Pathni's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Charu PathniJason T Widjaja's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Jason T WidjajaQuora User's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Quora UserDushka Zapata's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Dushka Zapata (Btw I love your answers)Sachin R Kamath's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Sachin R KamathSo after these and few more answers I started loving the idea of living alone.Thank you guys :)Here are few things I tried out:Walking Naked: Definitely walking naked in the room tops the list. It’s the sign of liberty and Hell I loved it.Dancing: Ohh dancing! I tried it I danced like crazy I know no-one is watching me. What a booster.Cleanliness: I have cleaned whenever I wanted and other days I was sleeping with lunch boxes from restaurants.Listening music: I love listening to music and and type of music totally depends on the moment I’m in. Hell! I never experienced so soothing music before. Volume up and stand in the balcony and let the lyrics pour in your mind with the wind.Silence is deep: I started enjoying silence. It is addictive. It is amazing.Never misplace anything: Ohh ohh! You will find everything wherever you you’ll leave it. Nothing ever will loose anything (mostly).I read: I have Kindle now and I read more than ever. This helped me.Everything you purchase will be used and ruined by only you, no one else.Honeymoon for your tongue: I bring the food I love. I order whenever I feel like hungry. Discussing what to order is not an over-head anymore.Unlimited sleep hours without disturbance: You sleep anywhere you want. You can sleep on floor or on the bed or even in the balcony and nobody will interrupt for anything. On weekends I sleep for hours in days and night. I read when I wake up and then sleep again.Living alone and lonely is totally different.I can study more than I used to. Nobody ever makes fun of that. Nobody calls you geeky or less cooler because of it.Cooking: I tried Cooking, it didn’t work out but I can whenever I want and I’m not afraid of that. Except roti, I couldn’t do it yet.Overthinking: It is not a problem anymore because I’m friend with it. It doesn’t bother me anymore. I’ve learned to let go thoughts.You need nobody: In the end of the day, you don’t need anyone to complete your day.You can bring anybody home: Yes, and no-one will know. Ever! No-one will gossip about it.F.R.I.E.N.D.S: Watch friends on speaker all the time and nobody looses their mind about it.Whole bed is yours you can sleep either side of it. You own whole bed :DTalk to myself: This might seem filmy but I do this and it is one thing that everyone should do. Try to say what you are thinking. Give words to your thoughts and they will be stronger than ever.Love for family: I have started loving my family more than ever. I don’t know how!In short, I’m king of my own little planet whose anthem music is:Cons to living alone: But very few:I surely miss being with Mumbai friends. But I’m sure I would have missed them anyway.I don’t wanna live with anyone anymore. I’m even afraid to get married. I’m afraid how I’ll adjust with her.I want to run back to my little planet if I’m with people for long.But you can see pros outcast cons.One should definitely try once in the lifetime. But beware it is addictive.Thank you for putting the idea of writing an answer to my own question Anangsha Alammyan (Quite tough name to pronounce though). Loved it. Thank you :)
It’s magic!I stay alone for the past 3.5 years. With utmost certainty I can tell you that living on your own is magic. It teaches you responsibility, discipline, importance of freedom and sooo many other things! Sounds like I’m faffing? Let me break it down for you.Independence- You’re on your own. There is no one to do chorus, buy that grocery, get the faulty tube light fixed, cook dinner. I have not kept any help nor do I have any friends or family staying close to my place. I am on my own. And there is no one else to depend upon except myself. There, that is what is true independence, freedom from any external outside support.Freedom- You are you without anyone’s permission. No questions asked, none answered. You don’t have the drain and pressure of having constant, tedious duties to fulfill, and you never have to walk on eggshells around other people. Nobody around needs to be taken into account, you are all you have.Long lost hobbies- You have plenty of time when you stay alone. No amount of binge watching Netflix or sleeping can keep you preoccupied always. Lesser minds would deduce that’s why staying alone is meant to be boring. NO. You re-learn. Things you had discarded earlier comes back. For instance, I had always enjoyed mithila painting. The gruelling 5 year law course and an equally hectic professional life, made me forget how much I enjoyed doing it. These 3 years have brought it all back. True it took my months to turn the painting contemplation into an actual painting! But I did finally. Look at this:I wouldn't have ever reverted to painting unless I had the experience of living alone and thinking about what I wanted to do truly.New things- Re-learning suppressed hobbies aside, you actually put thought in new things. Why can’t this happen when NOT living alone you ask? Of course it can, but on your own, you constantly try to do things. Why? To do different things, try your hand at stuff you haven’t done before. For me, I learnt cooking! I knew how to cook a normal daal-chawal and survive on myself. But I actually wanted to cook good new food. Sample one of my finest white mushroom pasta.Not bad, eh!? Truth be told, even Quora happened to me coz I wanted to try a new forum for writing.Money management- This is the real deal. You might have heard staying alone is way more expensive than sharing accommodations. I was told that many times by my parents when I was moving into my flat. Stay with someone, your rent will be divided. Ghar ka saaman bi baant k lana hoga. This may or may not be true but I do know for a fact your money management skills will improve by leaps and bounds when you stay alone. Accountability for your own hard earned money comes naturally, you see.Travel- I had always loved travel. I was lazy and always broke so never went. Until recently. My New Year resolution since two years is to at least go to TWO new places every year. Trust me, travelling changes you. It’s not just cliche, travel works.There are so many more things I can add to this list, but it’s gonna be just too long. You learn patience, appreciate people more, build confidence internally, learn to be self-sufficient.But you know, at the end of the day everything eventually boils down to how are you as a person.When you come back home to pin drop silence, everyone gets to decide for themselves if that’s akin to loneliness or freedom.
What it is like to live alone?
Staying alone is a form of art, I try to make it beautiful each day. I think I have taken the concept of  living alone to the next level. It has been a bittersweet feeling until now. My case is similar to yours, however, I stay in not a city. I recently moved to a small town called Crailsheim, in the state of Baden Württemberg, Germany. Here is a photo of a stream running through the town:Isn't it just a pretty little town? I arrived here for my internship at P&G and had already been here once before for the same interview. I had seen this place back then, and was sure I was going to have  to put up with the feeling of being lonely. I am introverted to some extent and didn't really think it was much big a deal. So, why is it so extreme for me you ask? Several reasons:I hardly know the language to start a conversation, and not many here speak English.Winter was coming, and so you better stay the fuck indoors for most of your time unless you want to turn into a Popsicle. Non-existent nightlife, because it's a very small town and you hardly see anyone out after 7 pm.You don't see many young people and the average age seems to be above 40. I saw four spectacle shops on the main street that stretches for not more than 300 m, and there is just one main street. I'm not that great at making friends and like the company of only a few people. I like to stay by myself and mind my own business.Non-existent neighbors. At least they don't seem that friendly. Fortunately, I was to find a big, cozy and fully furnished room weeks before I arrived here. I had never stayed all by myself in a room of this size and so beautiful, I just fell in love with it. It had everything you can ask for to stay comfortably, here are a couple of photos:I have not yet switched on that TV, and I ain't kidding :/This is the view right through the window of my apartment:So initial few weeks I was pretty much excited to explore the town and make some new friends at my office. I did that, and then I didn't know what to do anymore. There was nothing much to look forward to during weekends. All my colleague friends (I was the only intern student at this time of the year) would go out of the city, travel during weekends. I would end up sulking in my room. Fortunately, I had many hobbies, and for the rest of the time I had to find a new routine to work with. It has turned to more like a regiment these days.   So, my advice for you is to invest time in yourself and goes like this:Live in an apartment that you feel like going back to at the end of your day. Let it be affordable, I would say somewhere around 15% of your income. Gives you enough room and doesn't make you feel claustrophobic. Make sure it's comfortable enough for you to practice your hobbies/ job.Spend time on your hobbies or whatever you are good at. However, keep it different this time. I am good at making realistic pencil drawings and have been making them for the past 3 years now (Here is my Quora answer showing my realistic drawings: Sachin R Kamath's answer to What are some examples of your own pencil drawings?). But here I tried to make it different and do something unconventional. I spend most of my time on weekends thinking of my new art work and a way to execute it flawlessly with the limited resources I have at my disposal. Here is what I sketched recently for Walt Disney's birthday:Workout. Trust me on this one, nothing feels better! It will help you keep yourself active and efficient through the day. Gets you good sleep at night. Keeps you fit. You start feeling more confident of yourself  and people will start noticing you. It makes you disciplined. There's an instant charm to your whole body and the way you live. I hit the gym thrice a week and I try to exercise in my room if I'm not able to. And you probably guessed it right, I workout alone most of the time as well. I usually arrive at the gym after 8 pm and there is hardly anyone else there at this time. So I wasn't joking when I said I have taken the art of being alone a notch higher. Learn to cook yourself a nice meal. I hate going to restaurants and paying unnecessarily when I can myself cook. This saves me a lot of money and keeps me involved during weekends. Cooking is easy and also interesting once you start experimenting according to your tastes. It also helps you in socializing. Just cook some of your traditional cuisines and invite your friends/ colleagues over. I did that in my first month here and got to know many colleagues from my office who have been the only reason I don't feel as much lonely here. They always invite me for weekend hangouts in the pub (Yes, there is just one good pub here, at least!). Here are few of my culinary skills I learnt over the past few months:I can't go about my weekend without cooking now, and I don't have to miss my home food anymore.Travel. Don't be afraid to travel solo. I always made it a point to travel at least once every month. Just a get away for the weekend, to cities nearby. Visiting some friends or making new ones. In the past 8 months of my stay in Germany, I have traveled to 7 different countries. So just get out there and plot the contours of your life on the map of the world. Cultivate a new hobby. When you got so much time at your disposal, why not learn something new? I always liked photography, and this was the right time for me to pursue it. It fit perfectly into my schedule, since I would travel often and all I had to do was grab my camera along with me. I have taken some amazing photos during my travels and it's also a good way to keep your parents happy while they are on the other side of the planet worrying about you. One of my favorite clicks is this one from Dubrovnik in Croatia, before I took a tumble into the pristine waters of the Adraitic sea myself:In fact, I'm so alone that sometimes I take pics of myself with my DSLR camera, since I hate selfies. Buy a bike. The first thing I bought after arriving in this town was a bike    ( not even groceries). It's one of the best investments to make. You save a lot of money on public transport, get to burn your calories, and also go on long bicycle rides during weekends. I travel to office to and fro on my bike everyday, a total of 11 km. I did an impromptu bike ride of 65 km once. Passing through tiny hills and bucolic pastures, and getting lost in the woods. It was very scary, 'Wrong Turn' level scary minus the hot chicks! How I managed it is an entirely different story you can read here Sachin R Kamath's answer to What is the craziest thing you have ever done? Buy a good set of speakers. If you like listening to music while you work/ cook, then you must invest in buying some good set of speakers. Music in my room is always playing and keeps me alert and ticking. The point is to stray away from the feeling of loneliness, it works. Also, some beer after a tiring day while subtly drifting away to the tune of Floyd is a feeling to have.Read. Yeah, I know. Same old. What every other Quoran so called 'avid reader' says. But I would like you to find a spot in your town where you can sit, read, and contemplate. Be it a cafe or a park. I recently found mine across a stream, facing the skyline of  15th century imperial buildings with the Rathhaus towering over them in the background. Also, lots of ducks quacking. That was the sweet part of being alone, the fancy part. The bitter part also does prevail but you live through it and move on. Because failure is not an option. Loneliness creeps through your skin, tries to get inside you and break you, but you must stay strong. Stay focused. How do you do that? You get to the sweet part mentioned above, keeping yourself busy and exploring the new. Oh, and yeah, sometimes I drink alone too. Isolation, It ain't for the faint-hearted. It's a form of art, so make it beautiful. All the best!
If someone asks me what’s the best decision I took in my life, undoubtedly I respond with“MOVING OUT TO LIVE BY MYSELF”Disclaimer: Time duration I mentioned below might be different in someone’s life who moved out to live by himself/herself. However, I hope there will be coincidence between our cases.I totally understand you might wonder what’s big deal in that ?, so let me briefly include about my life ( trust me it’s just a small paragraph hahahah)Till my grand ma died , in 2013 May and it was my 22nd year , she used to feed me while I was at home. In 2013 August, I moved to USA , and here it was my aunt. If there is anyone whom I like as much as I like my mother, she is my aunt. Till 2016 August (means my 25th year), I lived in their home and she used to cook lot of dishes , in fact most of the times she asks me whether I like the dish she is going to cook, so that I can eat it. She is such a beautiful lady. So , just assume a guy who never cooked or lived alone till first 25 years in his life and suddenly move out.Huh, Come on man, it’s not fun.This is how I felt since I moved out :Month 1: This is awesome, living by yourself, having your own privacy , doing what you want to do , this is just perfect state of life. You try to cook various dishes, fail sometimes, but you still feel good because you are learning something new.Month 2: Sometimes, things become hectic in life, you find no time to cook , so you opt to eat out. After a week or two you realize that you are way above your spending, consequently going short of money . This is where everything starts.Month 3: You feel lonely, you come home every evening /night after your work/classes, you realize you have no one to talk. You don’t know what to do. Sometimes you text to friends , who might not respond sometimes because of their own hectic schedule. Finally, you feel lonely. Right at this point, few people give up and go back to normal life by vacating the apartment/home. But, the real benefit will be seen by those who hang in there and try to get over from it.In the book David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell called these sort of difficulties as “Desirable Difficulties”During this stage, you will learn more about you and your thinking. You will come to know what plays crucial role in your life and whether you are keeping priorities in correct order. In short, you will learn about you .Month 4 and from then:You will start working on yourself,.You get habituated to new habits.You cook at home just to maintain finances.You wake up at time and get your things done, so that you have to push yourself to start your day.You keep things prioritized right from paying bills to cleaning home every two weeks.No surprise, if your pillow becomes your best friend ( if you know what I mean )You find time for yourself.You will learn how to prioritize things in your life, especially in finances.You will realize how worst you can cook and the fun part is you have to taste it because you cannot throw it out. Come on bud, it’s our hard work we cannot throw it out. hahahahahahaPersonally, after experiencing this , I believe “LIVING BY YOURSELF” at least for an year or two should be experienced by everyone in his/her own life.The seed you sow to live by yourself, will reap with great benefits for you.Good Luck-Karthik Achanta

What is it like to get married and live alone?
Getting married can be wonderful and frightening.This is especially true if your spouse is in the military. Deployment is where your spouse is sent to another duty station. You are left behind because there usually isn’t housing available for the spouse. The frightening part is if they are in a hot zone (fighting going on) and you have to rely on the members of their unit to watch their back.You will probably need to find something to do with your time. A lot of the wives/husbands find jobs or go to school or both. You can do crafts and all sorts of things.Make your home a welcoming place.

Yes, immediately the same night. I am a well educated, good looking girl from an upper middle class society in a tier 2 city who got into an arranged marriage as love did not happen till my late twenties. The grooms family were relatives of my father’s friend , so we did not get into a proper bgc. The guy was a single child of his parents, they were well educated and well off, they showed a very liberal picture and pretended to be very affectionate. Soon after the ceremony, it was the boys birthday the next day, so I had ordered a cake (worth rs 500) in the same hotel where my wedding took place, the guys family denied to taste it or pay for it as I had not taken permission from my then mother in law. My father cleared all bills of the wedding including their stay, food , even the cake.I learnt my husband gives his entire salary to his mother and even his credit card messages go to his mothers mobile. He never paid for any of my petty expenses. Since I had entered the marriage, I wanted to be positive and not mind their stingy attitude ( I had done my MBA from XLRI and was earning well before marriage, had to quit my job to relocate with my husband and in laws), I thought I will anyway join somewhere and fulfill my own needs. I never expected any financial help from him anyway.Right after marriage to my surprise I was asked to stay in a room with a single cot and cupboard which my husband was using, so I used to sleep on the floor and live out of my bag as my in laws did not have time to do up the house. Even though I had money and I really needed proper furniture, the mother in law had to find time to approve the furniture which never happened. She used to plan the days for her son, even though I had quit my job and had planned a gap before joining the next job , I could never spend a day with my husband.My mother in law was always around my husband and would never allow us personal space as she was too possessive about him. She even cut short our already short honeymoon pretending she was unwell.Thankfully I had secured a new job within the first month of marriage in the new city. Initially I faced indirect remarks regarding them having to bear my food and recidential expenses (it was their own house, not rented) , I suggested to share the expenses but they wanted my entire salary to be transferred to my mother in law. This was the first thing I objected as I had been financially independent for 7 years and this step would have made me dependent on the mother in law even for the smallest decisions just like her son was.The household help was asked to leave and I was expected to take care of all the chores as ‘I was the woman of the house’ . But I had no rights. I had not managed these things before which was clearly communicated to them prior to marriage and they were fine with it then, but post marriage, they were constantly pointing mistakes, passed sarcastic remarks, used to taunt and sometimes humiliate in front of guests for minor mistakes in cooking/serving food etc. I used to cook dinner inspite of being tired from work and all the traveling. At times they would ask me to make some desert after dinner , at times they would keep my food aside and order in even before tasting the food saying they were not fond of the dish.The guy used to regularly check my phone, I never doubted his actions and had nothing to hide, he shared my location without my knowledge with his mother and himself. They used to question even when I spoke with my own family. They asked me to cut my roots to be able to grow new roots there. Due to the constant pressure in all directions at my in laws place it was impossible for me to maintain any contact with any of my friends, I used to immediately rush home after work, even tried Mumbai local trains to reach faster, being an outsider it’s difficult.I started getting very depressed as I failed to understand why these people were so unfair to me inspite of me trying so hard to meet their expectations. The mother and son used to hold secret meetings behind locked doors , within a family, this was strange for me. Finally they put immense pressure on me to quit my job on the pretext of not managing the household work well. I resisted as that was my only respite from the suffocating environment where you need permission from the mother in law to even breathe.My husband and his mother used to do everything together, even did not allow anyone else besides each other in car or the dining table, they were codependent partners. The only person my husband cared about was his mother, not even his father who was too old and financially dependent on his wife. They just needed a puppet for a daughter in law who would be completely dependent on them for all her needs and carry out their orders. I was not taken to a doctor even one time I was running 104 fever and left to recover naturally.All this happened within 2 months of marriage. Though I had not informed any of this to my parents as even I could not understand anything clearly and they would have been tensed. But my in laws called them to Mumbai to talk to them and pressurize me to quit my job. They expected being from a small town they would agree to anything to save the marriage. My father being very progressive and supportive immediately took me out of their house and was decided on ending such a marriage as he did not trust their intentions anymore. My in laws kept all my Jewellery, clothes, cosmetics etc but that was our least concern. They used to scheme and lie at the drop of a hat. I took few months to come out of the shock and filed for a divorce, it took 1.5 years and lot of mud fight to end a 2 month long marriage. I still face the social stigma as a divorcee but at least I breathe free air, laugh , talk , travel like before. Have my family and close friends with me. I feel fortunate to have come out of that hell so fast.Now moral of the storyPlease please please try to spend enough time, judge a person, don’t ignore alarm bells before marriage, better safe then sorry. Don’t ever give in to societal pressure because of biological clock ticking, no one really cares afterwards.Know that extremely greedy and selfish people do exist , they will never treat you as a family but as a commodity. Stay away from mamas boys , read about the mama’s Boy’s syndrome, Oedipus complex . You will be reduced to a third fiddle in your own relationship.You can not build a foundation of a relationship on manipulation, mistrust, lies, scheming, torture etc. It defeats the very purpose of a love relationship which is supposed to nurture you and help you grow as a human being.If still you get caught in an abusive relationship, run fast in the opposite direction and save your life. DO NOT linger on false hopes, people don’t change much post their 30s. Don’t worry too much about society, not more than your life and freedom to breathe.EDIT : The reason I shared all these incidents in such details is even If it helps a single girl recognize such people before getting into such an arrangement or inspires anyone come out of such an abusive relationship, I will feel much better, more than taking revenge which many of you have suggested in your comments. Question that many have asked- Reason I didn’t file for a DV(though initially I had a lot of anger) is it would have further aggravated the situation, given the Indian legal system, what took me 1.5 years because the guys side agreed for mutual consent divorce during counseling itself(I had filled for an annulment) would have taken me lot many years to prove as mental harassment cases are not easy to prove. When in a family, you don’t record conversations apprehending a divorce. After consulting a good divorce lawyer, I took a guided step. My only aim was to be free of that relationship as soon as possible- legally and mentally, plus you can’t really beat shrewd people in their own game, it is more draining for you then for them.As far as their next victim is concerned, I am sure that they won’t get the guy married as their purpose was to silence the society when it asked why they were not getting the guy marriage till a late age, that is achieved. As some of you have already guessed, the mother and the son were in an unhealthy relationship, I have bumped into situations which point to that, don’t know till what extent their partnership was, I did not mention this part earlier as I did not want to take the discussion there - it’s very difficult to know unless you stay with such people, but yes I have mentioned indicators and symptoms of knowing these before getting into it now that I know. They had even preplanned my divorce if I did not agree to their terms, reason I say it is they had insisted for the ‘special marriage act’ instead of ‘Hindu marriage act’ during marriage registration even though both were hindus(The former act restricts the alimony rights of the women only to the guy’s property not his parents- we found out later). Also now they know their other intention of getting a docile maid to slog, stay in a corner and pay for their luxuries can never be fulfilled. People may be fooled once but not for a lifetime.The other query was how to recognize a Mama's boy - while I am not an expert and there are lot many articles on the internet, some sure shot cues from my experience are 1) financial dependence 2) Can’t take decisions big or small without consulting mother 3) Mention her in almost all conversations, unusually large number of times. 4) his preferences match with hers almost in everything, again that points that he doesn’t have an independent thought process and has to please his mom compulsively 5) these families remain socially isolated and are secretive in nature. 6) Mom praises him for everything big or small, right or wrong, he needs that validation, when you show him the mirror, he doesn’t like it, shows passive aggressive behavior. Further, you can talk to a psychologist or read on the internet for more behavioral symptoms.That brings me to the next one - why I did not find out in the courtship period. I did have a courtship of about 5 months, but we were in different cities. His father had just undergone a bypass surgery before we met for the first time, so he could not travel to meet me , I travelled couple of times but never met him without his family (except for a lunch). Even phone conversations were around his fathers health and wedding preparations. Lets just say we were easy believers and had never seen such people in life, and they were good actors, so it was a easy for them to fool us.And finally the last question why did I tolerate their nonsense for that long. Well, when you have entered into a relationship commitment, you need to give it a chance, benefit of doubt, reflect on your own actions, try for improving yourself and the environment, try to communicate. I did all of this for those 2 months. When I saw all this was falling into deaf ears and I was being perceived as an idiot and a push over for putting up with everything, their expectations from me kept increasing, I took an action. We should be flexible, but know our saturation level, how far we are getting stretched and act before reaching our breaking point.Hope that answers all your questions. Many thanks for extending your love, support and good wishes. Take care.

My first marriage lasted 89 days.That’s slightly longer than a Kardashian marriage, but still not terrific.Jokes aside, it’s not that I am flippant about marriage. I waited until I was almost 30, with a guy I’d known and worked with for several years. He seemed to be a kind, successful, respectable person, and public figure within our community. I felt lucky to have snagged him. I asked him all the “right” questions, trying to uncover any possible stumbling blocks: religion, children, fighting “style”, life goals, debt levels, sexuality… you name it, we covered it.I didn’t expect that everything he told me would be a lie. Damn, I still can’t get over how good he was at lying. I’ve never encountered anything like it. But there were few to no warning signs that he was a terrible person until the week of the wedding. When people and worlds start colliding at an event like a wedding, it can become difficult to suppress the truth.The wedding day was a hot mess. Everything was a sign that I needed to run, but I was bull-headed and determined to go get my way. I didn’t pay attention.For starters, I had to buy a dress on my wedding day. Not kidding. My dressmaker failed to complete the gown I’d been fitted for in the months prior. She showed up with a half-sewn, un-pressed gown the day before. My parents scrambled to find me a time for fitting at David’s the day of my wedding. I purchased the third gown I tried on, and it was actually really lovely. That’s beside the point.As we arrived at the ceremony, things felt very strange. Our families were standing on different sides of the gallery, not speaking. I went to my room to get ready. I can’t describe it as well as I want to, but something was “off.” My father, as he walked me down the aisle, gestured toward the door and said to me, “I don’t know why I’m saying this, but I need you to know that if you want to walk away from this, if something feels wrong, I have my car pulled up and I’ll deal with the fallout.” He’d never mentioned being against my ex previously. I shrugged it off, but holy shit.So we got married. And that’s when immediately, the kind, gentle, loving man I had been engaged to became a total POS.His best friend and our best man showed up—a person he previously claimed was straight, but clearly was both gay and in love with my ex. He gave a toast that made 120+ guests cringe. It was all about how in love he is with my ex, how he’ll never forget the first time they laid eyes on each other, and how he’ll be there for him when our relationship inevitably ends. (Spoiler alert! I found out later they banged before we met. Bet you didn’t see that coming!)We danced our first dance. He didn’t like the way I was dancing, so he whispered frustrated coaching remarks in my ear the entire time.His parents, people who had until this moment embraced me with love, refused to give us a toast and sent his brother instead. It’s as though they knew what I was getting into.Later that night, I walked out in my ridiculously hot new lingere. He couldn’t perform. But he was really excited to order 10,000 calories worth of room service and pass out.My mother’s pearl earrings that she let me borrow were stolen from our hotel room that night.See? Hot mess. Of course I had the thought “what have I done!?”And it only devolved further over the next 88 days. I found out he hadn’t filed taxes in 5+ years. My bank account that I put his name on started getting routinely raided for funds by the IRS. He became verbally abusive and controlling. His many other lovers (at least SIX of whom were on the guest list to our wedding) started coming out of the woodwork. And so, so so much more than I could convey in this post. It’s humiliating…still. But, the silver lining is that it’s over. I had his things removed while he was out of town and never spoke to him directly again, despite him making threats to me through our contacts and lawyers.I am remarried with kids now, and forever grateful for the life I live today.I’m anonymous because years later, in some way, I still sort of fear him and how he might retaliate if he knew I was telling people the truth.
I did, because I wasn’t a ‘virgin’.Imagine being intimate with your husband on the first night, for the first time ever. He's constantly looking down to check something rather than in your eyes. Then sighs deeply, thrusts a couple of times to finish, and immediately runs out of the room.He did return after a couple of minutes, visibly trying hard to control his anger.Him : "You're a used disgusting woman who has spoiled my life."Me : "What?"Him : "You're not a virgin. I couldn't see any blood. You're a cheat."Me : "What the fuuuuuuuu.."That was the first conversation I had as a newly wedded girl minutes after I lost my super duper precious virginity with my 'perfect' husband, handpicked by my parents.First night, and I was made to feel first like a prostitute, then like a cheat, and finally like damaged commodity. It was like his world came crashing down. I tried to actually give him basic 10th standard level sex education. That some girls don't have hymens and sometimes it just breaks from normal physical activities. But no. For him, it was like 'seal broken, product faulty'. Too bad we don't live in a tribe where a bride's virginity is a topic of open discussion the next morning. All my poor husband could do was huff and puff and act irate. The whole family was concerned how he went from being super excited to super irate in one night. They asked me, but how could I say their ideal son was only excited about uncorking his new trophy, not be wedded & start sharing a life with a girl. This went on for 2 whole months. Not even eye contact with me for compassion, but only interaction was arguments. Actually, we did have sex once during that time. I think he just couldn't control his excitement to a female body lying vulnerably on his bed. It had nothing to do with me because he didn't look at my face or talk to me before, during or after. I had gone along with it because I thought finally my efforts are paying off and he is normal now. Too bad.I had to literally have him verify the little hymen factoid with 3 gynaecologist. One of them even scolded my husband. Not only he had no trust in a girl he was already married to and it wasn’t even about a perceived ‘lie’ about my sexual history, he actually had the attitude of a cheated commodity owner. I was so disgusted. Am I no more than an iPhone that can be jailbreaked? Even if I wasn't a virgin I would have owned up to it & still not let him objectify me! After 2 months I finally lost it & yelled at him to go hire a detective to dig up my past if he doesn't trust my word. That's when he let it go. At least in front of me, I won't be surprised if he has actually hired one. But by now the damage has been done. I now know how he perceives our intimate moments. They are not 'bonding experiences' to him as they are to me but as achievements or rewards, no matter what he says now. (Which isn't much. He just chants 'I’m sorry, give me another chance' like a whiny baby.) I has been 6 months to our marriage now.There are so many other problems, like how I can't even buy a coffee mug without my father-in-law's approval. How his mother shares such a codepedent bond with her son and just won't let go. It's like we aren't a couple, but I'm the third wheel in their relationship. It is suffocating our already damaged relationship. But if my husband can't see that, even I don't have the energy & inclination. How there is no privacy and all the women are always scouting my belongings, how they have dumped all the household chore on me since the first week like I'm an unpaid maid.Honestly, if I wasn't for the 'what will people say' phenomenon, I would have filed for a divorce. My parents keep telling me to adjust because unless he's hitting me regularly, there's no reason.Either this relationship will kill me, or I will kill it. Since the latter isn't happening, the former will.
Woah! I’m not alone. I used to wonder, why me? But then I realized that shit happens.To start with, I’m a north indian guy. My parents started looking for a prospective bride three years back. I’m reasonably built, just above average looking ( a little exaggeration) guy with typical engineeering graduation. My expectations of a bride was simple and clear, just like anybody else, I wanted an urban educated (I’ll get back on this), decent/good looking girl who shares my values. Pretty simple, isn’t it? That’s what everybody wants. Well, ideally.My parents are orthodox but I have lived with them all my life, so I took this fact very lightly. As soon as the search began, my parents went to our native for an indefinite vacation. I looked after the family business and was doing reasonably well. Now, proposals started flowing in and I rejected all of them as none were suitable. In my case, the proposals were consistent at one fact- every girl I denied, the next one was getting worse. That’s primarily because all proposals were from my native place - less educated, less decent looking, let alone sharing my values. I couldn’t get a single proposal which could at the least satisfy the first two requirements. Anyhow, I never lost hope. I was waiting for the perfect match. As a typical indian guy, I confined myself to ‘arranged’ marriage because of parental and societal pressure. No matter how much you earn, how forward thinking you are, you always fall for this trap.One day, my parents sent me a proposal on WhatsApp and the moment I recieved it, I immediately turned it down-politely. I did not have the voice to sound rude to them. Now, my parents had other plans. They said that I didn’t like it because she wrapped herself up in Sari and she was not photogenic. I told them otherwise. But they didn’t budge. They told me to get down to my native a see her in person. I denied. They played tricks on me and somehow got me down to native. Now, they told me that they have other 3–4 proposals in hand and wanted me to see them in person. I visited them and couldn’t imagine my life with anyone. I rejected all of them. When I had to return back, they told me that a meeting has already been arranged to see a girl and I don’t really have to say yes. I reluctantly agreed. And, here we are, meeting the girl I denied.Now the real twist in the story starts. I did not like the girl in person as well. But my dear ones (excluding my parents), whom I trust blindly fell blind and told me to say yes. I was shocked. I shrugged and said that we take this discussion back home. We left. After reaching home, I asked a few dear ones and they told me to accept the proposal. I fell prey to the emotions and reluctantly agreed. Immediately upon my agreement, my parents started the marriage process. They informed the bride’s parents, paid customary visits, discussed other topics etc. Marriage was fixed six months from then. I was not happy at all. I came back home and strongly disagreed, but my dear ones convinced me otherwise. I did not talk to the girl and strongly advocated against it to send them a message. The bride’s parents were ignorant about it.Months were passing by, I couldn’t believe that I was getting married. I was clearly not happy about it. In fact, I was depressed but never showed it on my face hoping for the best. I hoped that I may have been making the right move. I never informed any of my friend of my marriage. No enthusiasm. None.All wedding shopping started. All relatives gathered and I’m still hoping for the best. No sign of happiness. Atlast, the D day arrived. I wasn’t happy with any of the marriage arrangements, but who cares? It was my parent’s son’s wedding that I attending, not mine. Marriage completed. The girl arrives at my home. I can subtly felt the vibes from my neighbours, family friends, relatives. They weren’t quite excited. But who gives a fcuk?First day into marriage, after we were done with post marriage rituals, I felt there was no spark of first night in me (mind you- I’m highly sexually active). Nevertheless, I thought to myself- let’s make this work. As soon as I entered in the room, I made my first move, I held her hand and sat down. I offered her to get rid of all jewels and makeup and feel at ease. She agreed. I told her that I didn’t want to rush things up and that we get to know each other before we could get intimate. She agreed. A few more formality questions and she agreed. We slept that night - strangers to each other. Now things started to prick me- the way she spoke, the way she behaved, the way she was. Nothing wrong for her and everybody around me but everything wrong for me. Next Morning, I realized that I have made a blunder, that she is not the one I can live the next 50 years of my life, that she is not the one I’m willing to see as my child’s mother.Second day into my marriage and all the negative thoughts gush into my mind and heart. I did not want to live with her. The girl had no fault. She would make a good wife of herself, but not to me. Suddenly, I didn’t want to live in my own house. I wanted to leave.There’s a saying - If you don’t like someone in the first sight, you will never like them in the eternity. This was the issue in my case. She was not to blame. It was my fault to have entered into this marriage. She was just as blind and unaware as I was. We returned back to home. I did not speak to my parents and to that girl at first. But later I cleared the air that I have made a mistake and that this girl was not suitable life partner to me. Since then, there has always been tense moments in my home.To cut long story short, she lived with us for roughly three months and has gone to her parent’s home for a vacation. Their parents have also come to know about this situation. I have not contacted her or them and have not let them contact me. My parents believe that all these are my stars’ doing and not mine and they are living in hope that things will settle in the next year.Now, I’m stuck in this marriage and waiting to end. I have decided that no matter what, I’m not going to accept that girl as my partner and I hope that the girl understands this at the earliest.Any suggestions/advices are welcome. Criticisms are also welcome as I know that I am the one to be blamed and no one else.

My mom told me she realized on the honeymoon what a disastrous mistake she had made marrying my father. Apparently after a year and a half of being charming, loving, etc, he turned into a complete douchebag. Started (continued, probably, just not in secret) smoking pot, drinking heavily, refusing to work. She was close to his family and her own were all dead or estranged, so she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt at first. Left him once after my older brother was born but he pleaded and begged and said he would change. He didn't. By the time she had decided she wanted to leave for good, she was pregnant with me.Epilogue: Because she's tough as nails and very smart, she stuck it out until I was 13 (the age at which children of divorcing parents in Georgia can choose whom to live with), then bailed. Today she has a PhD in educational leadership and heads up a string of schools in Dubai making an extremely healthy six figures. She's my hero for every reason a mother could be and I'm so proud of her I could burst.
As many others before me have said, if something niggles at you about the person, you should listen to it.I am from India and it was an arranged marriage. When my parents discussed about marriage with me, I told them that I would go by their decision as long as the guy is able to converse in English. Though my mother tongue is Kannada, I was more comfortable in English and we spoke English at home except for my mom. Everyone in my extended family spoke in English.So when this guy came, though he knew English, he was not very comfortable with it. And everyone in my family scolded me for having such a stupid criteria.In hindsight, I should have put my foot down. Anyway, my to-be-MIL wouldnt let us meet before the wedding, which we all thought was weird. She was like talk to me, but dont talk to my son. First Flag.So after our wedding, when I first went to their house after a few days (because of other ceremonies being held at the bride’s house), my husband planned the honeymoon at that time. So during the day, he made a plan to go to Ooty. He didnt even book the bus tickets. We went to the bus stand and bought tickets to the next bus going to Ooty.I had never done that. My dad was a planner and would have planned everything months in advance. So we really didnt have much to talk to each other. But our trip was ok, not luxury but comfortable. Of course, he made me spend for the entire trip.It was only after we came back, his father scolded him for letting me spend. But he didnt regret it. He is like her father gave her the money for the trip, so I asked her to spend.Silly stuff like they wanted my dad to buy a bed because they wanted to show their neighbour what my dad could provide for his daughter. The day my husband saw our daughter for the first time (No, he was not around for her birth), he said now you can not leave me. My dad touched his feet and said he was sorry though there was nothing he said or did to insult my husband and his family.His mom was crazy. After breakfast, she would clean the whole house, all windows, doors, etc, including the garage everyday. This would literally take up the whole day and it would be 5 or 6 in the evening by the time, we were done with the cleaning. In addition, I would have to make lunch and dinner. I had no idea how, so she would scream out instructions and I would make. His sisters once asked what my dad would have done if they had asked for dowry, I said he would have refused. How I wish they had asked for it, instead of asking after the marriage. Everytime, my dad visited me, he gave me some spending money. I had no money and I was not allowed to even think of working though I was an MBA.Anyway, long story short, this state of affairs continued for couple of years and then one day, I called a cab, took my 8 month old daughter and walked out of their house to never return. And before divorce proceedings could start, he passed away but not before he married again while being married to me and getting his second wife pregnant. My In-Laws kicked his second wife out of the house before my husband was even cremated.
I did…24 years ago. My husband was more a best friend than a lover, but having had my heart broken by a passionate, cheating lover the previous spring I thought, “Well, Paul will never cheat. He's a good guy, and we agree on politics, religion, money, goals, etc. This one I should marry.” It didn't occur to me that the limited nature of our physical relationship wasn't strictly as a result of his religious upbringing.Imagine my surprise when on my 4 day honeymoon, we had sex twice…That was UNTIL I allowed him to take explicit pictures of me in my lingerie. After we had them developed at a 1-hr Photomat (anyone remember those?)? In the last day on our honeymoon, we had intercourse 3 times. Each time, however? He'd take time to look at those pictures before he crawled into bed…it should have set off alarm bells, “Abort! Abort! Get an annulment!“ but it didn't. I just vaguely sensed that something was really odd…So, fast forward a couple weeks. We're moving in together and I notice 3 LARGE boxes off in the corner of what was to be our “spare" bedroom. They were FILLED with VHS tapes of every type of porn imaginable (Some things? I'd never even heard of!).I confronted him, but he refused to get rid of them. I kept on and threatened to get a lawyer (we hadn't had sex since the honeymoon). He agreed to get rid of the tapes…and did. I did, however concede to let him keep about a half dozen of his “favorites" (my mistake) that we could “watch together.”I was foolish enough to think the problem was solved. We did watch “together," but I quickly realized, he wasn't focusing on me.In short, Paul has been severely addicted to porn (using multiple times/day) and has REFUSED and/or been UNABLE to have sexual relations with me (w/o porn present) for over 20 years.My two children were both conceived through combined use of alcohol and porn. It's the only thing that worked...It aches to think about the years I’ve spent alone and lonely in my marriage. It horrifies me to realize I was willing to debase myself in bed with a man who would only have sex with me if I allowed him to view porn before (or his preference, during) intercourse. When I gave in? His eyes never once left the screen. It wasn't me he was pinning down or bending over. I was just... a convenient... prop.It also sickens me to think of all the times I chose food in the middle of the night, or laid there trying to stifle my tears so no one would hear, rather than giving vent to and dealing with my true feelings.I’ve loved him and worked hard to be "a good wife" for him. I kept upgrading my appearance (until I started using food to cope), I cooked gourmet meals on a budget, handled the books, housework and laundry. I always made sure to look good when he came home from work. He never noticed.When I look back at old pictures, I am amazed. Objectively speaking, I really was pretty. (Or attractive, shapely, cute, wild, enticing, hot, beautiful... it depends on who you asked). But whatever the adjective, I knew I was a woman men appreciated and desired.And I was naive enough to believe sex wasn't going to be THAT important once a couple got married... I married my friend because he was everything my previous boyfriend was not. And THAT was a mistake. Yet, without him? My children wouldn't be who they are, so I can't completely "wish things away."That girl was pretty, smart, funny, and sexy, but she got misplaced somewhere along the way.Parts of our marriage have been good, some even great, but this one very important area feels shattered beyond repair. While some may disagree, I consider sexual expression a need, not merely a want. Like Paul said to me, "Something's broken inside." And he's right. But the brokeness is in me every bit as much as it is in him.Paul and I are friends, we finish each other's sentences, compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses, we laugh at similar things, read some of the same books, we have great kids, and we've never differed on how to raise them. We have history. We have everything... except the one thing that makes me feel the most alive, human, and feminine.I ache to once again experience the thrill of watching a man respond and eventually lose his self control and give himself to me. That moment, watching ectasy bloom on the face of a lover is the most thrilling, evocative, beautiful, powerful rush I've ever known.This is me today:The more I think about it, the more enticing an FWB (Friend With Benefits) sounds.
Yes.Not after the ceremony but even before it. Actually things happened so fast that it was out of control even before I could gather what has hit me. It was an arranged setup and hence I gave benefit of doubt to the girl who acted like someone who understood me and what I wanted as a married person. Oh boy, can’t tell how wrong was I.Our relationship lasted for around 2 months or so and I’ve never been happier taking that final call of ending it. My analysis of the whole situation is that the girl had some psychological issues which isn’t very apparent, but when you actually live with her, you realize that something is amiss (and it was a big deal as it popped up in even very minute aspects of daily life). Very short courtship period ensured that I was fooled into the entire thing quite conveniently. Add family pressure to the situation and everything for me went for a toss.Many lessons learnt in the process.Do not haste into marriage.If you’re not sure even for that 0.1%, halt everything, stop right there and rethink the entire situation.Gut feeling is the most important feeling for any person. It never lies and is barely wrong in crucial scenarios like this.Do not believe your relatives by the word. Worst creatures on the planet. Only trying to meet their ends (evil or good)
Going anonymous as my husband is on Quora.Few years into the marriage and we are still struggling to find our spot of peace. We are on a break currently due to our differences.Background: Ours was a love marriage. We belong to different states and cultural backgrounds in India. In my part of India, women are very emancipated and treated equal as men. He comes from a place where the primary duty/talent of a woman is to be a good cook. Dowry is looked down upon at my place whereas as his it is a matter of pride to show off. In short there are a lot of cultural/social differences between our families. We were in love. Few problems I could not anticipate in that heady feeling of love, several others I was not informed about by my fiancee then.A week before the wedding I was having a very uneasy feeling about everything happening around me. I started getting bouts of dizziness. Had a low hemoglobin count and had to take medications. I could not sleep and had to coax my father to give me a sleeping pill every single night.During the wedding cermonies, I came to know that the families have had a string of fights regarding customs and arrangements. When I was at the mandap, I heard my father-in-law call my folks a bunch of tribals. My heart sunk.The evening was panning out to be a horrible precursor to what was follow. Married life was never smooth. The sister in laws always carried a vendetta against me for whatever happened that day. I was expected to be good at cooking/cleaning from the word go. There is no domestic help either and I was expected to do everything. Nobody considered the fact that I was studying and working away from home most part of my adult life and I was not a mere stay at home kind of girl. My husband sadly did not do enough for me. His silence encouraged the sils even more. Apart from that there was a constant financial expection from both of us. They even expected me to contribute my salary for their expences. They say you can conquer all differences with love but sadly the love was not enough for us.I have returned to my parents to nurse my bruised soul. I might or might not return to our home. I believe all my misgivings during my marriage was my intuition warning me of the disaster ahead.My regret is that I should have loved him enough to overcome all cultural/ideological differences. Loved so much that I would have lost my identity and beliefs. Or I should have known enough about his family to take a more informed decision about him.P.S. Relatively new to Quora. So please pardon the slights in the flow of story telling :)

1 – Figure Out What Makes You Truly HappyIf you have recently gotten out of a relationship, or are simply not currently interested in anyone, then try not to look at this stage in your life as a negative thing. Being single gives you a wonderful opportunity to figure out what truly makes you happy and gives you the perfect chance to get to know yourself better.Being single grants you the time and freedom to do whatever you want on your own schedule and allows you to put your needs, desires, and ambitions above all others.Not being in a relationship will help you realize and understand that your happiness does not have to depend on someone else’s presence. You need to be able to be happy alone first, and love yourself in order to give your love to someone else and have a successful relationship.If you don’t know what is going to make you happy, how can you expect someone else to? You need to know and experience what real love and happiness is like by yourself before you commit to loving someone else.It might be scary at first but here are some ideas that can help you to feel more positive about being alone.Get to know yourself by spending some time alone in solitude. Do something that will help you relax and focus on your mind, body and soul. Go shopping, take a bath, listen to some new music, have a glass of wine, watch a marathon of your favorite show and don’t feel guilty about treating yourself or making yourself a top priority.Habit #2 – Give Yourself a Fresh StartSometimes we get stuck in monotonous schedules and our days feel like they merge together into a week that’s exactly the same as the last. Maybe you have forgotten what it’s like to feel happy because you simply aren’t stimulated with what’s happening in your life. Perhaps it’s time to write a list of all the fun things and activities that make you smile.Write down new places you would like to explore, games you would like to learn how to play, or books you would like to read. Once you start making this list, you will look forward to trying these new things and you will start to get excited about the possibilities available to you.Sometimes all it takes to feel refreshed and happy is to change something simple out of your daily routine. Maybe it’s time to rearrange your furniture or redecorate your house.By changing something in your surroundings, it will help you start fresh and prevent you from feeling like your life is stagnant. You can also look at moving, rearranging or redecorating your house to create an instant fresh start or renewal of your current stage in life.Plan a cleaning or de-cluttering session. Get rid of things that are collecting dust or that you have been hanging on to because you’ll feel guilty if you throw them out. Remember that it’s time to start living for you and no one else. Only keep things that make you happy, are important, useful and meaningful to you.Habit #3 – Practice Self-LoveSelf-love is a state of appreciation for oneself that grows from actions that support our physical, psychological and spiritual growth. [source] When you stop thinking about how other people can make you happy and practice self-love, you will soon realize what it feels like to be happy alone and be able to learn to love and accept yourself from the inside out.Here are some ways you can practice self-love:Stop putting so much value on what others think and stop striving for perfection. Everyone has their flaws whether they tell you or not. Once you have accepted that being alone is normal and natural, you will begin to realize that it’s okay and be perfectly happy while alone.Alone time will allow you to be mindful of your thoughts and surroundings. You will be able to feel happiness and peace and know that you have absolutely everything inside of yourself that you need to be completely fulfilled. You do not need to expect anything from anyone else.A great way to practice self-love includes writing down things that you love about yourself. Focus on the positives; you are healthy, unique and have great hair, wonderful personality,nice legs, beautiful eyes, or whatever you decide.You can also practice self-love by being aware of your negative thoughts. If you are constantly thinking with a dark cloud overhead then you will never leave room to let the sunshine through. There is a positive side and a negative side to almost any situation. Train your mind to think of the positive outcome and, over time, this will start to happen naturally.Another way to get out of the negative thought clouds is to surround yourself with positive things and people. If you are at a low point, you might not even want to get off of the couch and reach for the phone but it’s important to get out of the house and be around friends and family who love you and who will help you take your mind off of whatever it is that’s bringing you down.If you tend to avoid the phone or make plans, then try committing to something up front. If you commit to something, then you will be less likely to back out when the time comes to actually do it.Here’s an example: Pre-pay for a 10-week kickboxing class or sports league. Once you have made that up front long-term commitment, it will be much harder for you to say no to these plans, even when you are having a bad day.Habit #4 – Exercise and Build a Healthy LifestyleMaybe it’s time to reconnect with yourself on a physical level. Start a new exercise program that will help you get into shape, feel good about your body, and even reap the numerous benefits of endorphins.Working out shouldn’t always seem like a chore, there are some great programs like spinning, zumba, or even Xbox games that will allow you workout with others in a fun way. If you commit to joining a class and have a friend that signs up with you, you will be less likely to quit and you will have double the fun while you workout.If you do not wish to make a big commitment, then start out small and check out some different types of workouts in free workout tutorials on YouTube to see which ones fit you best. Make these new exercises a part of your morning routine so it will keep you refreshed during the day. The best part about morning workouts is that you won’t be thinking about having to workout for the rest of the day because it’s already done!If you have a dog, you should have no problem going for a daily 20-minute walk or run. Your dog will love you for it and will help keep you committed by reminding you that it’s time for your daily walk; how can you say no to those cute little puppy eyes?What’s eating you; or more like, what are you eating? Sometimes our diet can affect our happiness and bring our mood down. Take a look at what you have been eating, and look for healthier alternatives. A great way to do this is to use an app or diary for one week and write down everything that you have consumed. You might be surprised at just how much unhealthy food you are eating and when you review your journal at the end of the week, you will be able to see where there’s room for improvement in your diet.In addition to the quality of the food we eat, the quantity of the food we eat can also effect our moods and happiness. Often people turn to food when they begin to feel sad and depressed. Eating can give some quick relief but it is always followed by self-recriminations if you eat too much. Not only that but consuming large amounts of food can lead to lethargy. Simply by controlling portion sizes of the food we eat, we not only help to keep ourselves healthier, but also happier.Sleep is also extremely important in order to keep you energized throughout the day and it even has the added benefits of helping you lose weight and keeping a healthy lifestyle, mind, and heart. [Creating good sleep habits] Go to bed early and sleep in once in a while, but make sure you find a balanced schedule. One of the best benefits of being alone is that you can take up the whole bed without getting kicked or nudged in your sleep!Habit #5 – Find Your Passion and Cultivate ItIs there something you’ve always wanted to do but keep putting it off? What’s wrong with trying it now? When you’re alone, you no longer have to consider other people’s plans. Choose to do something different that will be a challenge for you. It doesn’t matter what it is. It just needs to be something that you’re passionate about.If you love animals, why not volunteer once a week to help out your local shelter? If you’re stuck on ideas, then there are many fun websites that can help you out with this decision; local dance classes, art classes, photography classes, acting lessons, cooking classes, day trips, guitar lessons you name it, you can find it in your area.Sometimes we don’t truly find our passion in life until we have tried and experienced many different things. You should keep in mind that there is never any harm in trying something new and experiencing something new can actually be quite fun. It will get you out of the house, allow you to be around new and positive people and help you renew your confidence for learning new things.Habit #6 – Step Out of Your Comfort ZoneTry doing things that you’ve never done before. Try not to have your guard up and be open to all possibilities; you don’t know that you won’t like something until you’ve tried it.A great way to step out of your comfort zone is to go somewhere and do something new and fun each week.Another great thing about being alone is that no one is there to say no or disagree with your plans.When you start experiencing new things, places and events, you will probably be meeting new people and make some new friends. This may seem difficult at first if you are shy but putting yourself in other people’s shoes might help. Remember that it may be hard for someone else to make friends too and you could be that one person that could help someone else out.Remember to do things that benefit your inner-self and not for the purpose of finding “someone.” There shouldn’t be any pressure to look at people romantically.Stepping out of your comfort zone and trying new things can lead to new friends and amusing experiences. It all starts with you smiling and saying hello to someone else. Try saying hi with a smile when you’re at the grocery store, while you’re walking down the street, when you’re meeting someone for the first time at a party, etc.Whatever the situation is, just try to put yourself out there and you’ll gain more confidence over time, eventually this will turn into a new habit. Seeing other people smile is also contagious so if you start the smile train, others will reciprocate and you will both be in great moods.A good way to keep yourself out of your comfort zone is to try a 30 day habitevery month. Make sure to try new things, experiment and do things you might not do otherwise. You may even find some great habits you want to keep forever.Habit #7 – Use Your Alone Time WiselyMany people might think that the answer to being happy is a simple one: just do things that make you happy.However, due to psychological attachments, this is not true at all. You may enjoy chowing down on a quart of Rocky Road ice-cream. You may enjoy watching an entire season of Dexter in a single sitting. But in the long run these things will not bring you the happiness you desire and are quite likely to bring you guilt and remorse.There are many things you can do when you’re alone and watching meaningless TV shows or eating your favorite comfort food might seem like a great idea at the time, but for purposes of happiness they are often counterproductive.I am not saying to never enjoy mindless tasks or have a treat, these can be okay once in a while, but why not use this time wisely and get to know yourself better,, learn something about yourself or challenge your mind.Read a great biography, watch an inspirational documentary, start a new business or create a new website. Lose yourself in your art, music, woodworking, cooking or any other meaningful work.Need some inspiration? Spend all day at a gallery or museum and let your mind experience different reactions and emotions to these art pieces or educational experiences. Choose your time wisely and make sure that at the end of the day, you were happy and satisfied with what you accomplished.Remember, at this point in your life, you are alone so you are able to create something meaningful and spend as much time as you like doing what you love to do. When you lose yourself fully into your work, you will become proud of what you have created and this will leave you fulfilled and happy.Creating smart and realistic goals attached with a timeline will help keep you motivated. Start off small and focus on your most important tasks first. Once you get into a routine, you will not even have to think about your daily to-do schedule because you will have programmed your mind to just do it and get it done.Another great advantage of being alone is that your goals do not need to involve any outside influences. You can be, do, and have whatever you dream of. You can create an amazing future for yourself, and by yourself.Why not take this time to focus on one or two aspects of your life that you have wanted to improve. Whether this involves your health, career, spirituality or finances, don’t let these wants and aspirations continue to be pushed to the side.Think about how you would feel and why it would be beneficial to have all aspects of your life in order and under control and you will be able to envision a brighter future, which will help motivate you to pursue and stick with your goals.Habit #8 – Learn to Appreciate the PresentWe are who we become because of our life experiences from the past. Forgive yourself and acknowledge your mistakes from the past. Remember that the past does not always dictate your future. We all make mistakes and your mistakes do not define whom you are or whom you could be. Learn from mistakes, but celebrate the small wins of the present.Think of the person that you were 5, 10, or 25 years ago. There will be many challenges, situations and obstacles that will come and go our way during our lives. If you had never made any mistakes or harbored any flaws, what type of person would you be now? What types of experiences would you have had and how happy would you really be if you were striving to be perfect for your whole life?Life can be busy and hectic enough, sometimes just having the time to sit back and enjoy a nice cup of green tea could be something that can refresh and revive you. Don’t think of the things you do not have but live in the “now” and appreciate the small things in life that help you relax and enjoy what you have in life to it’s fullest.http://www.newsnytro.com/

Why it is important to learn to live alone?
How do I learn to live alone ?
You can't really learn to live alone, but you can sort of ease into it. The key is to be able to enjoy alone time. Try doing things by yourself such as going for a vacation alone or going for a movie alone or planning to go out for lunch/ dinner by yourself or even cooking for yourself. If you enjoy doing these (and other similar) things on your own, then you are already on your way to enjoying solitude. If not, then start by making these experiences enjoyable. For example, if you don't like cooking just for yourself (most people don't!), try putting on your favourite music while you're cooking. Also, plan and cook special/ new things, like you would if you had company. Do something similar for other daily activities too.Use the alone time to do things you may not have been able to do had you been cohabiting. For example, learning to play a musical instrument or a dance form. This will occupy you as well as divert your attention from being alone.Then there is the lighter side to it as well. You can find comfort in that you can take longer showers without having anyone banging on your bathroom door, you can watch ridiculous TV soaps without being judged, you can eat ice cream straight out the bucket (:P) without being told off and so on.One last piece of advice. Living alone can sometimes take a toll. You never know when you slip into being lonely. To counter that, you should ensure that you have a daily routine and stick to it. At the same time, stay open to changes like going out with friends, someone coming over for dinner etc. Be in regular touch with friends and family. Even if they can't be physically present, talking or video chatting with them will do you good.And finally, I wrote a quote on my blog post once that I would like to share here:There is a difference between being alone and being lonely: know it. Don't ever be afraid of being alone. And don't get too used to being lonely.p.s. - These thoughts are coming from someone who has never lived alone, although very much desires to. But I have managed to create my own space (physically as well as mentally) even while cohabiting, where I am able to enjoy solitude. I also travel solo, go for movies/ shopping/ coffee on my own.p.p.s. - If you don't want to live alone, get a dog. I know I will get one when I go off to live alone.Cheers,
How do we learn to live alone?
Living alone is perhaps the most arduous task given you crave attention and interaction with people. Being alone gives you power to handle and an opportunity to get head to head with situations without any help that indeed make you stronger at the end.Loving your solitude is an art not everyone is profound at. It takes suffering and a paramount patience to get to that point. I can't say I still love being alone but to some extent I have learnt to accept these emotions and entailing emptiness.So how do we learn to live alone…..When after Doing everything to please the person you like to be with you leave you empty with your own depreciating thoughts to deal with.When your love for other is deemed an annoyance ,like you are infringing upon their life.When people contact you only when they require something, and when you need help everyone gets invisible in jiffy.When your respect is marred owing to your humble and affable nature .When you are judged , ridiculed for you not-so-great look .When you are unable to convey your pain to other ,and slowly learn to deal with your own.When you try to get relief with your pain by getting into trivial relationship and ends in a thud.When no one loves to give you company and their precious time.When slowly but painfully you learn that solitude is perhaps better than someone by your side.When you learn that when alone you will not be hurt by anyone. That no one will leave you in excruciating cringe,that might take years to heal.Yes , initially it was gloomy, perhaps spooky to get through it. But yes , eventually you will realise it's ensconcing abode . Where you will get all creativity shooting forth.So it's good to be alone……..You will never learn to worship God within ,If you are craving for its embodiment outside.GS……
How do I learn to live alone ?
Well it depends on the type of goals you have in your life.Let me explain it.If you are going to be a coder, sits on a computer. Then write some blogs in your free time. By some time, you will be in your professional stage this thing will eventually compound and you will see the results later.If you are going to be a person at administration: read some newspapers.If you are going to an entrepreneur: read books.I know the above answers are bad. You read about them at some platform and constantly want new answers, facts, basically you want new, new.So what I'm trying to say thay instead of sitting still in your reckliner, find some hobby, passion, which drives you for the day.Visit library, go for a long drive, run in the morning, eat healthy, watch news, watch Netflix, see the war between world, install 9gag use Firefox, do squats, organize your room, change the sitting arrangement at your place, do painting, learn martial arts, change habits, read books.And remember change your habits it will change you, believe me.Thank you.Get a dog.

How do I prepare to live alone?
I looked at Find Your Spot | Find Your Spot to find the place I would best fit. Several places popped up.Then I did homework about the places I found at City-Data.com - Stats about all US cities - real estate, relocation info, crime, house prices, cost of living, races, home value estimator, recent sales, income, photos, schools, maps, weather, neighborhoods, and moreWhen I found the place I wanted to live, I went to several rental websites like Apartments for Rent - Rent.com® Apartment Finder and other rental websites in the new town.I found a lot of apartments but most of them were very expensive. I printed out the information sheets and map locations for about six different locations in different parts of town so I could choose the right neighborhood.Since the location was over a thousand miles from my home town I found a hotel near the airport with low weekly rates. I planned to fly there and stay a week, rent a car to drive around and look at the apartments.I did like one apartment on my list, but driving around I found another apartment building that was older, and off the radar. It was even cheaper and better than the cheapest one on my list.I had to sign a two year lease and the move-in date was a minimum of another week away so they could prepare my new apartment. I flew home again, packed up my car and drove to my new apartment.I needed money for a two-way flight and car rental, hotel, gas for the rental car, gas for my car, hotels when I drove across country, rental deposit, first month's rent, a new bed (used furniture are against the apartment's policy because of the risk of bed bugs). Luckily I didn't bring any furniture with me and I could furnish my new apartment with better fitting furniture.The whole move cost was at least $3,000 but I would plan on having more than that just in case, but do not carry large amounts of cash because it might be seized by police who suspect you of drug dealing.
What is the best advice for a person who is beginning to live alone?
There will be a time, when you close the door and sit down. Then there will be silence. And then it happens... You will know what I mean when it happens. It is a special feeling. You are alone, nobody will enter your room, you are not responsible for anyone but you. This can get a certain dynamic.In a bad way it can lead to inertness. You are missing the drive and sit around. Or it can get boredom or in worst cases even more...However, this can also be the most beautiful time. Then, when you realize that being alone with yourself is a perfect chance to experience yourself. You can treat yourself nice, you can meditate (take this advice serious), you can read... you are not responsible for anyone... and if you sit with open doors in your restroom, nobody is bothered... if you sing in your room, nobody is bothered... if you run naked through your room... etc. Enjoy this freedom. See it as most enjoyable time with someone you love (with yourself). Soon enough this might change again... And when you are married and have lots of children, you might miss that time.

How do I begin to live alone?
For the first time or is it after a death or sudden being alone?For the first time then check its viable financialy,if so then set up the money so you always have a roof over your head and food in the cupboard.A routine is good,with the cleaning and so on.Set days/times things are to be done and try and stick to it.Set aside time for yourself out of the home,additional to work,maybe a gym or golfing,book club,shooting whatever but get a hobby so you meet different people.Cook proper food for yourself,it gets you out shopping and is theraputic at night cooking a meal,also saves getting on the junk food wagon and is cheaper.I loved living alone,I read a lot,sometimes at home,the park,the pub even on a afternoon.But you need other people in your life so make sure you do something,anything to make you go out a few times a week.I suppose the same applies after a death,being totally alone all the time is never good for you so make a effort,as hard as it can be.

What is it like to be married?
Awesome!You get to wake up with the one you loveYou know that you are lovedYou feel safe in that you know what your routines areThere is a deeper more comfortable love that forms and is more powerful than the short term After 8 years I have really got to know my wife and that means we can know what she is thinking and know how to be there for herIt is a more selfless way of being You get to learn different ways of seeing things from a female perspective and she can learn a masculine perspective also.If things get hard you know that your real only option is to sort it out. Somehow this makes it easierYou don't have to worry about the crap of clubbing, drunk people, uncertainty of whether this person is interesting or whether they are interested in youIn conclusion don't marry just anyone, find someone, that you are sure you want to be with. Then you get to bet half of everything you own that you want them and only them for the rest of your life.If you get it right, then you win the lottery.

What will make a married man cheat on his wife?
This question is a big question. I take marriage as living together and sharing responsibility for a very long time (hopefully to death). The legal piece is just a piece of paper.For me, it has many emotional and material benefits. Assuming you got married to a kind and genuine person.Emotional benefits:1- You mutually decide to have a very long term relationship with someone you love. This trait is hard to find, so wonderful and easy to take for granted.2- Life is not easy. Even for us, who have good jobs and relatively good situations, sometimes life is hard and depressing. Sometimes you lose control of your emotions in the hurdle of life. Reminding each other to be grateful for what we have, in those hard times, is priceless.3- Being able to share pretty much everything, and discuss pretty much everything. Now, this is something you can’t find with many people. If you tell your friends that you are having a hard time at work, or arguing with your friend, they will potentially judge you, and you will reach no solution. The trusted spouse will listen to you, share her opinion, help with a real solution, and keep it to herself.4- You wake up at night, you feel like she is not breathing for a moment, sweat cold, then check and verify her breathing, become the happiest person again. That happiness is not comparable to anything else.Material benefits:1- You merge wallets, double the income, and share the costs with maybe 1.2x of your single expenses. This advantage helps to gain financial freedom easier. Requires everyone spending responsibly though.2- Share all the tedious housework and make it fun. She does vacuuming when you clean the patio, etc.3- A friend that comes to every vacation, every dinner you have, and that can carpool with you every single day. You never feel lonely. This benefit is both material and emotional.As you see, these all require two good people to get married. If one of them starts exploiting the other, things go downhill.I wish everyone find their favorite person and live a great life. Don’t listen to those who compare marriage to temporary stuff like housemates or paid services like housekeeping, etc. Life is never that material.Lastly. If you are getting ‘permissions’ from each other when married, something is wrong. There should be no permission. There should be respect instead.
What is like to be married?
2 marriages: 2 different experiencesmarriage 1: making the best of a marriage I was manipulated into. Threat of divorce made me take job as high school teacher instead of continuing education as desired. Had kids because my wife wanted them, then got vasectomy. Some happy times, but also struggle over whose needs would be met. Eventually she fell in love with her boss, told me she didn’t love me, and plunged me into deepest depression of my life.marriage 2: both madly in love and wanted marriage as commitment. 36 years so far of love expressed in words and deeds. Each delights in giving other the things he/she finds important. Feeling of partnership in making life happy for both. Quarrels, generally just because one is upset and never about anything basic, are quickly made up. We both sincerely believe life couldn’t be better than this for us, except for the long, hot summers where we live.

Is the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life! I get to wake up next to her and see your beautiful face in the morning sleeping! I get to spend the entire day with her doing things with her, conversing with her and just enjoying the blessings that God has given me! And then I get to go to bed with her at night! I can think of no better way to enjoy and soak in life. Just hearing her speak is thrilling to me. She is more than I could have ever dreamed of and more than I deserve.

Is living alone good or bad?
“Living alone never felt right, sometimes it feels good but it never felt right.”Every now and then you need somebody by your side to share your day’s work, your feelings with them but finding not a single person in a world of billions to talk to about your problems about yourself, not a single friend and even isolating yourself from parents because they never understand you, feels like crying continuously and let that pain out or sleeping whole day to never face reality.Yes! Happiness is alone time, just me and my bed.But sometimes that room my couch my solitude sucks!Typing ‘I am good’, ‘Life is beautiful’ ,‘I am fine.’ with tears continuously rolling down your eyes and trembling fingers hurts. It chokes!The person on the other side never know how you are feeling. Telling them also don’t work often.Because sometimes it is only you who understand YOURSELF better than anyone else.And then you want to run away for a while. Get a break from everything. So that you can build yourself strong enough again, pick up that load efficiently and so that you don’t shatter in pieces. But you can’t like just run away.Because you have to face it and Be a warrior B)Happy Life :)

Sleep and wake up any time depending on one's convenience.    The Flip side to this:it  Will be difficult  to share the room or space with another person once you are used to this kind of freedom and space.The occasional feeling of loneliness as some times it could be boring Living alone is expensive as room Sharing is more economical you might end up paying extra for lesser comforts as compared to a peer who is sharing a room with someone.
What's bad about living alone?
I worry that I'll die and no one will realize for several months and I'll finally get my 15 minutes of fame posthumously in stories about how society forgets people.Also, that it'll be by choking on my food and no one will be around to pound my back.  I've given up eating Mint Imperials for this reason.It's lonely for the first year or so.  Then I got over it and found it quite liberating.  No one else to help with the household expenses.That's about it, for me at least.  Other people wouldn't handle it so well, especially the type who need to someone to talk to every day.
LIving alone is not a good choice. But sometimes we have to face this situation. We came to this world by alone and leaving here by alone. In between our birth and death we meet many and living as a social animal. Some circumstances make us to live alone for a periods.it is not parmanant. If we alone at home for a while, no need to worry. We can make good friends in our society.

What is it like to live alone?
Yes it can be a lot more joyous than you think it can beSo during past 4 years since I started working , I have lived in almost all types of places with all types of peopleIn a PG - 3 people sharing a single roomIn a 3 bhk flat - 2 people sharing a single roomIn a 3 bhk flat - 1 person per roomNow alone in a 2bhk apartmentSo having experiene in all types of accommodation I can definitely say that living alone has been the best experience for me. Here are some advantages which I found personally:-No shifting homes : I have lived in 7 different homes in the past 4 years due to shifting of roommates, incompatible roommates, theft of personal belongings, bad food, to stay with friends, job change. Now since I am not dependent on anyone , I no longer have to shift home unless a job change, so definately a positive :)Free living: When i come from office, I like to have a self time and do whatever I want to do, play music, watch netflix , walk around or do nothing at all . You don't need to be obliged to talk to someone, or adjust as per other person will.Get rid of useless discussions : I can tell you from my experience, that living with girls you tend to get involved in useless discussions and petty issues and deal with them on a regular bases, and they could range from using kitchen stuff, to maintaining cleanliness, listening to high sound music, smoking issues, boyfriend issues to what not. Though I had some pretty good roommates but a good compatibility level between everyone is rarely possible and people always like to complain.Get more independent: When you live alone, you end up doing almost all the house work, from cooking, cleaning to maintaining the house from paying electricity bills, maid to everything, and in the process you learn a lot.Parents can visit you anytime: Earlier my mom was hesitant to visit me bcoz it could create discomfort to my roommates, but since I am living alone, whenever she gets a holiday she visits me and happily helps me in setting up my home. It is something which I wanted from the past 4 yearsYou can host parties and night stay for friends: My place has became the place for all parties which I like hosting and we always have a place to stay over with my friends, my school friends sometimes just come over for weekend stay and we could spend the weekend talking and sleepingWear anything: I can wear anything or nothing, since I am alone at home, I love being in the most comfortable clothing's that I could not wear when staying with peopleKeep my room as I like: I love decorating my room and I can keep it the way I like it , which was not possible when I was sharing my room.Setting up your home: I have seen most people don't like spending too much on how they live, they think they will buy stuff once they are married or settled. I don't get this concept as according to me why waste these years by not living the way you want to, in waiting to get settled. I have now started buying stuff for my home, and got tv, washing machine, fridge, air conditioner , bed, almira, dressing table already, will add more stuff as I need themI have seen many people are afraid to live alone or some people just can't live alone, I am not one of them as I like living alone and I don't feel scared also.Here are some pics of my home :One with the old bedMy mini craft cornerFlowers to start your day offThis cute couple I bought recentlyWihen I bought my first bed coverA colorful painitingMy new bedVideo tour of my room ( with all the lightings )0:00-0:42
This is going to be the third time I'm mentioning my house (and my third changed house) but living alone comes with its fair share of perks.I have been living in Bangalore for 2+ years, and I have changed my house four times, earlier I use to live with three working women but their kleptomaniac behaviour, sense of superiority and entitlement, because I was youngest, was taking a toll on me.Then I had to move my last two houses because of the job change, and currently, I'm living in my small paradise. I live in 1600 Sq feet house to myself in near HSR, Bangalore. It is a 2BHK on a ground floor with my little personal garden (yet to maintain)Since I'm a Work from Home consultant, I don't need to go out and work, so I invested a little into a place where I can call both office and home.- Now the joyous part of living alone varies from person to person, Being a cleanliness freak, I use to keep my place tidy but was never appreciated for it, and sometimes people would make it dirty and never bother to clean-problem gets cleared because you fix it and only you ruin it.- It is easy to host family. A lot of my friends have mentioned how their flatmates are not okay with family visiting for a more extended period as it breaches the privacy of everyone.When you live alone you can call them for as long as you want, it has just been six months, but my mother stayed for two months and brother for another, and there were 0 hassles.You can host game nights, dates, etc. at your house without uncomfortable stares.-I get to arrange furniture and place the way I want with 0 say of people on the outside and in a fixed budget — also, arguments around who will take when we move out.-I can save myself from Splitwise embarrassment over small things, also not to remind someone to pay rent, water, electricity, wifi, groceries etc.-I can roam in my underpants all day long, I decide who is coming to my house, play loud music, sleep wherever I feel like and fill up fridge the way I want.Now, to clarify living alone doesn't mean that one is lonely. I have friends over; sometimes I stay over at friends place. I have always been someone who loves her privacy, so for me, it is essential.In the past I have lived with people be it boyfriend or flatmates and experience has not been good enough, I cannot dominate people into living the way I want, but I can always make a choice of separating my lifestyle from it, and it has worked out great for me.Here are a few pictures of my house:-My Living Hall2. My Study Area3. My office4. My Master Bedroom5. My love for Pride starts from my doorsteps6. View from my window every day7. This is my unmaintained garden8. Voila! my dirty kitchenTada!
I assume you are not asking about living alone in the wilderness - I wouldn't know anything about that - but about living alone with access to human society.When you made the decision to live alone (or when the decision was made for you) how did you feel? Did any part of you get excited about the idea?Did any of the possibilities listed by Kathleen Grace run through your mind? If not, and if all you could think of was about how sad or scary it was going to be, then perhaps it's not for you.That said, sometimes, one has to experience it to understand it. I think living alone is a luxury that not many people get to experience. Some tend to confuse it with being lonely, unloved, or antisocial. On the contrary, living alone, and therefore having the mind space to truly think free of distractions, can help you reach unexplored parts of your self and make deliberate strides towards self-actualization. (Ok, that sounds a bit like woowoo, but it's not!)Last, living alone does not preclude ever living with someone. It can be a stage in your life, it can be a scheduled break from living with someone, it can be a choice that you stick to until you come across someone(s) that you want to live with, or it can be a lifestyle choice for life. Whatever it is, I hope you learn to enjoy it.

What are the benefits of living alone?
Is it wise to live alone?
What does it feel like to live completely alone?
For me, I think the best thing in Bangalore is me living alone. I used to share a room with another girl in the initial days when I moved to Bangalore. But I needed peace. So, I saved money for 2 years and finally could rent a flat on my own. (In Bangalore it's a hell of a price to get a one BHK on rent that too for a single working woman )Why I find living alone is fun? joyous?I want my place spick and span. I hate dirt, filth, mosquitoes, flies, spiders etc. I am a very hygienic person and I clean my place every day. Most of my roommates I shared the room with didn't like this habit of mine. They thought I had a weird habit(I may have) but hey! What's wrong in being clean?NO DRAMA! And NO BULL CRAP. I remember my very last roommate once got drunk and started crying over her ex-bf. She almost ruined a good mood. Some of the other girls I shared the room with were even worse. Some would put the music on at late in the night, some would keep the alarm bells ringing without getting up and switching it off themselves and the most pathetic one: They would make their bed filthy and then use my pillows/bed/blankets.I don't like going out unless it's Durga Puja or my best friend is in the town. Not that am lazy but hey I get just two days offs after working for 10 hours each on 5 working days. I like taking rest, doing my chores, cooking myself some good healthy meals, washing my clothes.I decorate my room just the way I like it. I sometimes put on some fairy lights or some butterflies stickers on the wall. I play my favourite song on the speaker, open the window and enjoy the breeze. My flat’s not just a place to live but my ‘Aashiyana'My mom and dad visit me anytime they want. Earlier I always had to book a hotel room for them. But now when they visit me they stay with me, we cook and eat together and my mom always sends me to the office with a lunch box whenever she visits me. What could be more amazing?COMFORT! I can always wear an undie or a nightgown or anything I want. I don't have anybody to poke or pass comment. Sometimes I get up early around 6, make myself some tea and go for a walk, while on other days I get up late around 11 or 12 and watch series or just lie on the bed.These are some of the reasons I could really think of now.Some of the pictures of my place.Some of the meals I made :Edit: Thank you very much for your responses. I'm glad you guys liked my answer.Also, there's another point which I missed :8. Living alone is no doubt joyous. It's a responsibility too. It made me a responsible person. I was the same person who didn't even know how to boil an egg, learned cooking. All those years when I used to stay with my parents, I never ever did anything. Here I not only just learned cooking, started to do all the household chores that all the mothers do/have been doing. It's fun to be independent and live your life just the way you want. Even though I spend more money than my colleagues on accommodation, I don’t regret it. I feel living alone made me a better, sincere, disciplined, and responsible version of my older self.
Dear,Why do things appear different? What is it to be alone? What is aloneness? Does aloneness means ignoring the world? How would this be helpful for us?  The  more distracted the mind is; the more it believes in diversity, the  more it believes in different things to be different. Taking different  things, letting your mind be subjected to differences, is what is called  as chaos. Understand this clearly. Letting your mind become a victim of  differences, is what is called as chaos. A chaotic mind sees too many things and takes all of them to be independent of each other. The  forms may be different but the source is one. When you see that the  source alone exists, even though it manifests itself in a billion forms,  this is called Aloneness. The one who can see That alone in everything  and everybody, he is alone. That alone, only That. Nothing else. He  knows then that the existence is not divided. He knows that even though  the branches may be different, the twigs may be different, the leaves  may be different but the root is one, and the root alone is expressing  itself as the huge tree. This is Aloneness; the root alone exists.  Leaves will fall; even the branches will come and go. The root alone  really exists. This is Aloneness. How do you know that you are joyful? The climate of Joy is the absence of ambition and achievement. Joy is to retain one's health even in the middle of all kinds of diseases and diseased.For more clarity watch this video:For more discussions on this or related topics:Shri Prashant- Words into SilenceShri PrashantPrashant TripathiRD
Can an alone person be happy?
Dear friend,An alone person can be happy but generally that's not the case and the reason why you asked this question.Let's find out why we cannot be happy when alone with the help of this article from Acharya Prashant's blog: Words Into Silence“Why do we always require somebody’s company?”Even when there is somebody who is lying on the side of the road, let’s say an accident victim waiting to be helped, we wonder whether we are the first one or the only one who would be getting involved. We think so many times before putting our foot forward. In such situations too, we require the company of somebody else, why?This is just one particular incident where it becomes obvious, that we are so dependent on others. Such incidents only exemplify, bring forth to light that we are very very dependent. But, such dependence is not limited to these kinds of incidents. Kindly, do not think that in other general, day to day matters of life, we act independentlyThe mind is dependent all the time. But that dependence is subtle, so it doesn’t become obvious. But it becomes very obvious in such matters – you want to really do something and yet are unable to gather courage for it because nobody else is doing it. And then it becomes obvious. You would be missing the point, if you think that these events are special. These events are not special. These events only represent, what the mind always is; not in particular instances, always.Getting it?Look at this: You enter this hall and if you find that everybody is sitting on the back benches, on the chairs at the end of the hall, the rear end. You would find it quite difficult to simply come and occupy a front seat, wont you? But if you enter an empty hall than, you won’t have problem sitting on any particular chair, right?Do you see the comparison and what it brings out? You enter this hall and you find that everybody is sitting there, at the back, you will find it very difficult to sit all by yourself in the front, right? Even if the others do not say anything to you, and if they do not pass any comments, even if they are not at all bothered about you, yet it would become very difficult for you because, we are always looking for social sanction.There is hardly anything within most of us, which is really independent. Even the slightest, smallest, most routine actions happen with an eye on what the others might be thinking or saying.Look at our choice of clothes. A very general matter but very few people buy clothes purely out of their consideration for themselves. Most of us wonder, how would I look in these clothes? Now, look to whom? Others. How would I look to others when I wear this? And it is such a stupid thing. The other who is looking at you surely knows that this is just a piece of clothing, a textile product; it’s not you. And yet you are so concerned.If you were to speak to a crowd or let’s say come to this podium, your anxiety levels would be proportional to the number of students, the strength of the audience in this hall; others. What is the weight of the others? What is the mass and measure of the others? And if by any chance, the others are not kind to you, and just before you start speaking somebody makes a rude comment, or somebody just laughs or giggles, then you know how difficult it becomes for us, right?Now, the fellow has not even heard you. You haven’t yet started speaking and he might be giggling out of his some personal occupation, may be his neighbor has just whispered a small joke to him. So, his smiles has nothing to do with you. But, the moment you see audience smiling, you start sweating. And remember you still haven’t uttered a word. So, you very well know that even if they are judging, they couldn’t be judging what you have come there to do, because you haven’t started doing that.Every breath that we take, every word that we utter, every step that we take is a step steeped in slavery. We do not do anything independently, just anything. It’s impossible for us.I was in campus, I would see one of my batch mates keenly interested in a girl, in the junior year. And all the symptoms of attraction, and occupation of mind and all that happens in those years, they were all there. And I was seeing it since a few weeks. So, one day I went to him and I said, “What’s going on? It’s all obvious now but tell to me, what’s going on?” He said, “No, nothing, nothing is going on.” I said, “Now, will you hide it from me and don’t you know that I know.”He said, “I’m not very sure. So, let me just finalize it and then I will reveal everything. Pakka nahi hai(I’m not sure).” I said, “If it is love then, how can you not be sure about it? And if you are not sure about it than, surely it is not that.”He said, “No, no. it is quite certain yet not fully certain. I’m trying to ascertain it.” I said, “I don’t know what you mean but, fine, go ahead.” He said, “Just a little bit of formalities left. Let me complete it.”So, after 2-3 weeks one day he comes rushing, overflowing with happiness, bubbling. So I ask him, “Yes?” He says, “Now, I am fully sure. No doubts at all. Complete certainty.” I said, “How did that happen? Did some messenger from the heavens descend in the morning? Or you performed some litmus test or something? From where did you suddenly get so much of clarity?” He said, “No, no. I had actually sent just a few friends to her city and they have found out her caste, her sub caste, her economic status and gently we have also probed her parents and they are okay. And in between, I have been calling my parents as well, and I have found out what kind of demands they will have, including financial demands. And the girl’s family, I see, would be prepare to meet all those demands. So, now I am fully certain that I am mad in love. Now I know very well that we are made for each other. It is love at first sight. It is love without sight. Even before seeing her I knew that my soul has been thirsty only for this kind of a woman.”They are, in your social language, happily married now and have a happy family; very very loving family. So dependent we are, we can’t even love freely. Even in love, we first have to look around to seek permission – seek permission of religion, of caste, of parents, society, the neighbor, the neighbor’s dog, everybody must agree and if they don’t agree than, we dare not go ahead. Such deep dependence.Start by looking at small matters in daily life. If you want to just have a small walk in the night, do you really require to have somebody with you? And if you cannot walk by yourself then it’s not a small matter, it’s a symptom of a deep disease.There were times when I was in college, when I would go to watch movies by myself; alone. It was no rule for me, I could go with friends as well. But if good company wasn’t available, I had no problems with simply going and watching a movie by myself. And people would wonder, “How can you do this?” Some would be actually horrified, “You watched a movie with nobody?”What? Do you go to watch the movie or do you go to watch your neighbor? What do you mean by, “You watched the movie with nobody?” What will the somebody do? What will the somebody do, both of us are supposed to watch the movie right?But how difficult it is for us, to even watch a movie by ourselves; terrifying, right? In a movie theater with nobody by your side, “Oh my God! such a loner, miserable condition; all alone.” Those who cannot do these small things, being with themselves, how will they do anything significant, meaningful by themselves? You cannot watch a movie by yourself, how will you take your life decisions by yourself? And there is work, and there is a life to be lived, and there are directions to be decided, and there is love, there is marriage; decisions upon decisions.You cannot buy a shirt without considering what aunt is going to say, how will you chose a job without considering what aunt will say? Do you see that this is a condition of great helplessness? And it’s is not because you love aunt, that you are so dependent upon her.When you are dependent upon somebody, it is violence, you could not be loving that person. There too the relationship is of hatred. No slave ever loves his master, how can you love somebody who has enslaved you? How can you love somebody who has taken away your freedom? So all around we are caught in a web of slavery. And a very peculiar aspect of this is that those from whom we seek sanction, they are not strangers — they are strangers as well — but mostly they are the people we claim to be intimate with.Continue with the example of the podium. When you come here on the podium and you start trembling, do you realize who is it that you are afraid of? These are not strangers sitting here. These are people you know, and some of you might be having their best friends in this crowd and yet you find yourself shivering; trembling. That is the nature of our relationship.The closer somebody is to me, the more dependent I’m on that person and hence, closeness is directly proportional to the violence in relationship.You don’t feel bad when a stranger on the road says something to you, you do feel bad but you can kind of tolerate it. But when people within your circle make a comment upon you than, your self-worth is destroyed.The world might be calling you a fatso, you can manage to ignore it. But your boyfriend comes and says, “You are becoming sphere like, rotund, you are gone, you collapse and you will start hating the fellow; the boyfriend is gone. From where did this hatred come? It does not come from nowhere, it was always there; it only got expressed.You were always dependent on him and when you are dependent on somebody remember, I repeat you cannot love that fellow.Love happens only in freedom. It is a very free bird, it does not like cages and freedom we know not.So many of you gave these questions yesterday upon the forum, its good I have them in front of me. I know some of you won’t be able to speak here because there are now hundreds of you here, is that not so? After every Samvaad session, we have some of you stay back and then they open up, then they speak and I ask them, what happened in those 2 hrs? Why don’t you speak then? And all they can do is drop their heads.Unnecessarily ashamed. We didn’t speak then because there were so many others present. Even in asking questions you are dependent on others. So you cannot speak because there are others and there are some who would speak precisely because there are others. If I speak right now, it’s a good opportunity to impress a large audience, so why am I speaking? Because there are others here.We won’t be, we want to clearly say ‘I’. This ‘I’ has become very clouded, in fact it is nowhere to be seen. Our ‘I’ really does not exists, instead we have a fake ‘I’ which is just a collection of images from the world. We are so full of the world, that there is no ‘I’ness left within us. The world is dominating our mind, it has totally filled us up. It’s present in our very cell – the world; the world; the world. Our very sense of existence that ‘I am’ comes from the world. And that’s why Praveen, we are so dependent and so hungry for company.We are hungry for company because we are what the world is giving to us. So, if the world becomes absent then there is a danger that we will no more be there. Who am I? Who am I? Bits and pieces collected from the world. So, take the world away and do I exist? I don’t. So, I always need company and I always need validation, sanction, approval.But the thing is that if everything is coming from the world, then you anyway don’t exist. So, it’s such a poor attempt. It’s such a defeated attempt to live with an ‘I’ upon the world; to live as a function of all the forces and the voices and the faces around you. It’s such non-living, most people are non-living creatures. They don’t have a central crystal within them. They are just a little bit of here, a little bit of there, some kind of a pot puree, khichdi.So, you interview somebody and the fellow would have written in his CV, I am proud of my leadership qualities. What’s your strength? “My leadership qualities.” And you ask him how do you know that you have leadership qualities and soon you would find him saying that, “Well my friends and everybody else has been telling me that I have good leadership qualities, that’s how I know I have leadership qualities.” Now, this is a leader, this is a leader who knows himself to be a leader because others told him that you are a leader. Now who is leading whom? Are you leading or are you being lead?L: Lead.AP: There is nothing about us that is our own. And that’s why we seek company. The man who has found even a trace of that ‘I’ness, will not be desperate for company. When he will have company, he would be alright and when he won’t have company, then too he would be alright. He won’t start feeling out of breath. Oh my god, half an hour to kill and nobody to talk to, give me my phone, where is Facebook? Or let me just call up someone and indulge in meaningless chatter. And why did I call, because I am so uncomfortable with myself.You don’t like yourself, you are uncomfortable with yourself and you expect others to like you. You do not like your own company, right? You can’t live with yourself but you expect that others will like you. What kind of expectation is this?The best relationships are not born out of loneliness. A healthy relationship is born out of a sense of completion. It is not a parasitic relationship. “I feel incomplete, you feel incomplete, so let’s come together and together we will feel complete.” As if two beggars coming together will become millionaire.Imagine two beggars are begging each other, hoping to become millionaires. That’s how our relationships are.A healthy relationship says, “I am related to you in my completeness. I am related to you precisely because there is something that I can now give, I am not begging” And then there is no violence in that relationship. And then things like possessiveness, jealousy, insecurity, they are not there. The man who longs for company would surely be possessive, jealous, insecure and the rest of it that goes along, the entire package.We have been trained in a way, which has told us only of our short comings – sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. Since birth, we have only been told what we need to acquire. That’s what our teachers have been telling us, right? Now, you must learn this, “Students tomorrow you must prepare this chapter, now you are graduating to this class, now you are moving from bachelors to master program.” So, there is more and more to acquire. And acquisition means deficiency.So in a way the system around us has been trying to help us, but in helping us it has been constantly telling us of our deficiency – “This is what you do not know? This is what you do not know? This is how you are inadequate?”Nobody has ever told us of what we know. We have been told of what we do not have, but we have never been told of that which we have. We have been told a lot of what we need to acquire, but nobody told us of that which we do not need to acquire – That which is centrally important, that which not be acquired and which cannot be taken away. So, this mind is full of thoughts of acquiring, of the world because all acquiring happens from the world, you get from the world.Mind is dominated by the world – completely full of the world, completely full of the world and completely full of a sense of short coming, “There is something missing; there is something missing; there is something missing and what is missing can be supplied by the world. So, let me have this person in my life, let me have more money in my life, let me have a few more degrees in my life, let me have a better job in my life, let me have a bigger car and a bigger house in my life, all these are companies.Praveen, when you said that we always want a company; company is not limited to human beings. We want something in life, which may be a person or a thing, any object, we want it in life. We want it in life because we have been trained about all that which is missing. This is missing, that is missing, kindly get it otherwise you will remain incomplete. You need to find out, figure out, you are intelligent beings, ‘Do you really, desperately require all that you crave so much for?’ And what does that craving give you? Do you really feel good being dependent? Do you really enjoy suffering? Is frustration so necessary? Must we live like a thirsty fish, feeling bad and sad, with occasional bursts of hope in between?And obviously,When you don’t feel good about yourself, then you have a lot of hope.Hope is an indicator that things are terribly wrong.When you see that this craze for being surrounded, this craze for company is just a heavy load on your head, then you want to give it up. Then you will say, “I don’t want any more of it, I am alright; I don’t want company.” When you look at the small things in life and you see what it has come to, then you don’t want things.I was travelling with an old acquaintance, so he tells the driver — we were in the car — so he tells the driver, “Please switch on the radio.” Now, it’s my driver, so he knows a little about things, so he asks him, “What you want to hear, which particular lecture, what kind of music?” He said, “No no, just the radio, no CD, nothing, just the radio.” Driver says, “Alright sir which channel – an AM or FM?” He says, “Anything, just the radio.”He says, “Sir, anything?” The driver had not heard anything like this from me ever. So, the man says, “Just anything, something should be on, I cannot tolerate silence, give me something, something should be on.”Such is the depth of our disease. We cannot live in silence, we require something to be there. So, some idiotic radio jockey would be just blabbering something but that is alright. “Some sound is there and that sound is giving me comfort. Oh, I am not lonely, I am not lonely, somebody is there, somebody is saying something, something is going on.” Have you noticed this?We require something to be on. And you need to be attentive to these small things. You go to houses and you finds sometimes the television is on for twenty hours a day. Now, the lady in the house is not even watching the TV, she is in the kitchen or busy with her miscellaneous chores, but the TV is?L: On.AP: On. You ask her, “What is there in the TV? Which particular channel, which program?” She won’t be able to tell. But if you switch off the TV, she will immediately say, “No, no switch it on, switch it on. Something must be going on, otherwise I feel fearful; silence kills me.”A man or a woman, who cannot live in silence, is mentally diseased.Do you understand disease? Dis Ease – a sense of dis ease, the one who is not comfortable.Become attentive to these small things and then you will see that you do not need the world to be so heavy upon you.In this realization, there is freedom from the world. Just be attentive to what you are doing twenty four hours a day; you are intelligent. The moment you are attentive, you are intelligent.And,In intelligence, lies freedom
Can an alone person be happy?
Scenario 1 -Aikant (in School) was a shy introvert guy, a loner. He had two friends though. Let's call them F1 & F2.Conversation between F1 & F2 goes like this;F1 to F2 : Why Aikant is so weird? He never calls us, not even on occasions/festivals. Is he arrogant or thinks we're unworthy to be his friends?F2 to F1 : Yes, truly said. He never ever initiates a conversation. He always keeps a grin on his face that looks so evil & fake. Let him suffer in isolation. We'd never including him in our group.Meanwhile, Aikant finished his reading and about to move forward to talk to F1 & F2. But, he saw them indulged in chit-chat and chose not to disturb them. He opened his puzzle book and started solving it. He found solving those puzzles easier than conversating with friends. He was at peace while F1 & F2 had found another topic about another person to discuss.Scenario 2 -Aikant ( in college) had grown up to become a humble guy with clear thoughts & expressions. He talked to people only when it was necessary. He scored decent GPA and enjoyed cool lifestyle at college. He met two of his friends here. Let's call them F3 & F4.F3 & F4 while talking about Aikant ;F3 to F4 : Why Aikant is so boring? He never chills out with us. Either I see him in library or in his room. Perhaps, he's really opinionated about himself and thinks world revolves around him.F4 to F3 : Exactly my point. Perhaps he thinks that he's the only smart here. Well ignore that poor guy. Let's have beer tonight and avoid calling him to sit with us. He'll make our night really boring.Meanwhile, Aikant noticing F3 & F4 around, wanted to stop & say 'Hi'. But as soon as he saw them talking, he changed his mind, thinking not to disturb them in their private conversation. He walked away peacefully smoking his cigarette.Scenario 3 -Aikant (in profession) happen to be a hard-working, unsociable and sincere guy. He had colleagues at his workplace whom he considered his friend. Let's call them C1 & C2.Conversation between C1 & C2;C1 to C2 : Aikant never mix up with us in the office. Always keep working at his desk. I guess either he shows off or he's incompetent and never finishes off his work on time. He speaks on occasions to impress the boss and get his increments regularly.C2 to C1 : Yes, indeed. He might be confidante of our boss and stays late in the office to keep his eyes upon other employees. He's a good flatterer. By the way I have invited everyone but him today, on my son's first birthday. I can't bear this sinister at such an auspicious occasion. (Both laughs)Meanwhile, Aikant leaving for home, stops and said , “ Hey C2! I've heard today is your son's first birthday. Happy birthday to him. God bless.” And he moved forward to his home happily.Could you see the pattern in all the 3 scenarios?Aikant ( all alone) was meant to be lonely. He was never afraid of it. He accepted it gracefully. While his friends/ colleagues were busy discussing him , he made peace with himself. He didn't care what people may think of him or whether they liked him or not. He simply was lonely. It was just as simple.He grew his skills day by day while making people discuss about him , thus making their life busy.Be like Aikant. Make peace with yourself. And happiness will come your way. :)
It’s definitely joyous. It was painful for me to adjust and compromise with roommates in hostels/PGs.  I chose to live alone because I wanted to do exactly what I want, like: Waking up and taking a bath whenever I want to as there is no one to share my bathroom with.Working late without any disturbances if a deadline has to be met.Roaming around in under pants if I haven’t done the laundry.Free from following the standard menu of the house which I am not fond of.Not spending those extra 4000 rupees for a hotel when my parents come over to attend a relatives wedding.Not wanting to put that fake smile on when some random guy visits my roommate.Saving the embarrassment on turning down a roommate's request to drop her at the station while working from home.Not becoming victim to a new tv series my roommates suddenly glues to.Living alone doesn’t mean that I am unfriendly, depressed, rebellious or miserable. It simply means that I respect my own and others space and freedom. It’s just that I want to avoid those irritating discussions on why the dustbin was not cleared? Whose turn is to pay for the water can? Why was the light left on? Why fish, which makes the kitchen smelly, was cooked? Why was the fridge not loaded? Etc.  While living with roommates at least 90% of the time was spent on discussions regarding fashion, celebrities, ex-boyfriends and men. I would rather catch up with my friends for a movie or at a coffee shop or a weekend getaway where we can actually spend some quality time together.It’s true that when living alone we feel lonely sometime, but there are many people who live with others and still trapped with the feeling of solitude.  Of course there are financial implications when the expenses are not shared. I have made financial sacrifices like, using public transports; packing lunch to work; only watching well-acclaimed movies instead of all friday releases; visiting home once in a month instead of every week. But the feeling of listening to 80s Ilayaraja and 90s Rahman on full volume while deep frying your favourite fish; without anyone being annoyed by the choice of music and a smelly kitchen is truly awesome. Living alone can be joyous!

What is it like to be over 7 feet tall?
I don't really know, since I missed by 4".  But the late Manute Bol, once was asked the principal advantage and disadvantage said something very much like, "The principal advantage, you can see (he was wearing an NBA uniform at the time)".  The principal disadvantage is unrealistic expectations."He was from the Sudan, and I seem to remember the Dinka tribe.  He has the questionable "distinction" of being the only NBA player ever to have killed a lion with a spear.  They did things a little differently then, and the "dowry" he paid for his wife was 80 cows. His son, named Bol Bol, is 6'10" and in the 7th grade.  He is a good shooter and ball handler, as well as being just a bit taller than his classmates. His father was a good (though not extraordinary) 3-point shooter, which for some reason surprised many people.  People have (or at least had, for a very long time), the expectation that a very tall player would not be a good shooter from longer distances.  He was a 56% free throw shooter, and was always among the leaders in blocked shots (and twice led the league) despite playing comparatively few minutes.  His minutes were limited because of his weight (I've seen it given anywhere between 175 and 225 lbs.)An interesting statistic, according to the Bureau of the Census: only 5% of U.S. men are 6'2" or taller.  Men over 6'6", statistically, virtually do not exist Page on census.gov

What is it like being 7-feet-tall?
As a 7ft Frisian Dutchman, my height is abnormal, but not too weird. A lot of people grow to be 2m tall here.I can sum it up like this: I can never choose to not stand out.And when you go out, there are a lot of Davids and Napoleons that feel like they got their duck stepped on.People hand you leadership; so you best take it, or be mocked.It's a bit of a struggle, just being a grown boy in a big body, while everybody thinks and assumes you are awesome.It's funny; everybody wants to be different, but those that stand out, get mocked.But the benefits are obvious. Being tall you stand out and are never short of conversation (o how I loathe talking about my height, but every single person you meet seems to think they are so clever for pointing out your height), easily the centre of a party and don't have to be bored.People always remember you, comes in handy with calling them up for favors/jobs.Intimidation factor: people never cut in line when I am around; one grim stare and they tuck their tail.Look amazing with a full beardAddendum: can grow a good beardIf you look good and are still nimble: all the superfluous chicas.SportsFuck any transportation though
As a 7"9 tennage hulk, I can easily answer this. It's LIT. People are always commenting on you, how strong you look. If you workout, your muscles are enormous too. Pecs big enough for a friend to sit on, abs big enough to hide stuff between them, biceps almost 3 feet thick, legs 5 times thicker than most people. So cool.

Which is better? Getting married or staying single?
Why is married life better than a single life?
Married Life is Not better than single life. It is actually the total opposite.I'll lay out the reasons and you decide for yourself which is better.Being Married:It's a partnership and a life time commitment.Everything you want to do has to be discussed and agreed upon with your spouse.You have added responsibility once a child comes along.Sex maybe consistent at first but then it starts declining.There are times he or she will drive you up the wall.Your happiness is dependent upon the other party.You give up all your freedom.You have to meet the in-laws and get to know them. Let alone, accept them and them.. You!Being SingleYou are your own boss.You get to choose what you want and when you want it.You can build yourself a really good life. Study, Travel, Build a business.Your happiness depends on you.You can travel with a group of friends and not be bombarded with questions later about what happened.. (in Vegas)Yes, sex may be random at times if you are promiscuous. As long as you get it when you want it. I rather you wait..You have only one responsibility.. You, and maybe your parents.There is no need for a second opinion.You can choose who you want in your life.You have all these people to choose from.Yes, you maybe lonely. But I am sure you'll have friends and family.You can go back to school.You can do anything.Okay, perhaps I am being biased. There are pros and cons to being married or single. The thing is, remaining single for a while is a better choice. You don't want to be married and then get divorced in the next 2 to 3 years.It's better to save yourself all that heart ache before it even begins.Just my opinion!
Do you regret your marriage, and why?
Which is better, getting married and having kids or staying single and retiring very early (50-55)?
Why do people choose to stay single?
What is it like to live a life as single forever?
Is it better to get married, stay single, or live together? Is there a need for marriage?
There is nothing better in this world. It varies from the relationship status of that person.A Married men envy on the freedom of single men. While a single men worry about not having a companion and envy on married men.Pros :Single :Less financial troublesYou are the boss of your life . No need to answer to anyone and no nagging.Less expenses, more savings , early retirementDue to no responsibilities , you can take risks in career at any timeYou can date anyone , party all night ….More social lifeWith all your time at your disposal you can focus on the career or personal development.Married :You will have a caring familyYou will lead a disciplined lifeYou don't have to live alone in your retirementWith a stable partner, you will have good sex lifeMarriage makes a man more patience and confidentSurvey reports states , married men are less prone to suicide and depressionWhen you are ill , your partner will take care of you.Cons :Single :You will be alone in your retirementMore prone to suicide and depressionWhen you are ill, there won't be anyone to take care of youYou don't lead a disciplined lifeWith no stable partner , you will resort to random hookups or sex workers which risks your lifeMarried :If your partner is not compatible, you will have a miserable life .

Savings would be less due to more expenses unless your spouse too workingTakes long time to retireWith the burden of responsibilities, can't take big risks in life.Social life would be small as you will be engaged with your family time.
Single.You don’t need another person or sex to make you happy.History is full of single celibates who have lived joyful and fulfilling lives. As far as sex goes, you can actually be far happier without having sex or any other form of intimacy. Why? Well first of all, imagine being in a state of mind when you are never happy because you’re always craving something. Second by second your mind is agitated because it’s thinking of getting something that it currently doesn’t have, and the fact that you don’t have it is driving you insane. This is what life is like when you’re so preoccupied about having sex. You just keep craving and craving after it the whole day, and throughout all the time you’re thinking about it, you’re not happy at all, in fact you’re miserable because you keep feeling the frustration of wanting something that you can’t have. When you do get it, what happens? Maybe 15 minute of enjoyment only to resume this vicious cycle of agitating desire?But then you might ask, well how can I be happy then? My answer is, there’s something even better than sex or whatever joy you would find in a relationship. You might be thinking, how is it possible that there’s something better than sex or the joys of a relationship? Well, there’s a reason celibacy and spirituality go hand in hand. When you live a spiritual life, you begin to reconnect with our original source (known as the Divine, God, Allah, Jehovah, Krishna, etc.). In reestablishing that relationship, you start to feel an intense feeling of ever-increasing bliss that makes sex seem totally insignificant and unsatisfying. Imagine being in a state of mind where you are totally happy all the time, and nothing can take you out of that because you’re getting your happiness from inside rather than anything external (money, drugs, sex, etc.). It’s incredibly satisfying and will make you far happier than making yourself frustrated thinking about sex 15 hours of the day and then only getting maybe 15–30 minutes of enjoyment out of it at the end, or constantly being in anxiety because of all the mouths you have to feed. The pursuit of this lifestyle is infinitely more rewarding than any superficial relationship you may have.Moreover, it’s just a burden to have to be accountable for the needs of other people. Being single on the other hand is incredibly liberating and allows you to live a much less stressful life. Plus, while we do have a basic need for companionship, finding a group of friends is a much better way of fulfilling that need than a relationship. With a marriage, you have to deal with another person all the time and you don’t get a chance to get any time for yourself. When you find other friends, it’s great because you get a better form of friendship without any of the hassles that accompany a relationship.Look at him, he’s a single celibate, does he look unhappy to you?So basically yes, you can live a perfectly happy life single. If you wanted to read more about finding fulfillment from within rather than from anything outside of yourself, I’d recommend reading this article or this reading list. Good luck with your search for happiness. Hare Krishna .Sources: a previous article I wrote here.
Why single life is better then married life?
I won’t say single life is better, but you will have different experiences in life. I think you can achieve happiness either you are single or married. However, you certainly have more responsibilities when you are married.Life is simpler when you only need to deal with (care of) your own family. That is, you won’t have the conflicts with in-laws.You don’t need to adjust yourself to develop a new rhythm with other person. You don’t need to compromise.If you are single, you make decision on your own. You don’t need to consult the other person. You can follow your will.Your time is only devoted to yourself. You don’t need to spare some time for your spouse, your kids or your in-laws.Financially, you spend your salary on yourself. You don’t need to save for your children.You can choose / quit your job freely.You don’t have the responsibilities for your spouse and children.You have more time, more freedom.No one complains about you.You can date whenever and whoever you want.

Thanks for A2AThis would be interesting to answer.The single life …independence , freedom, me time, dreams, passion, goals and above all not being answerable to anyone. Just too perfect!It is like sitting on a swing, gently going back and forth,at our own pace,at our own will. Want to go higher…touch the feet to the ground and push and here you are…soaring and touching the skies , feeling wind in your hair,on your face ..Want to slow down…stop pushing,just let it be. You will come to a halt.Your life, your pace, your journey ,your destination, your freedom and your responsibility too. It is the stuff dreams are made of…The Married life…independence, freedom ,passion, me time ,dreams ,goals but with limitations, with constraints , always choosing one thing over other.It is like a roller coaster ride. You buy a ticket, you sit,secure the lock and you​ go.Slowly at first,then touch the heights,higher and higher, the stomach churns, heart beats faster, you shreik,scream, you feel scared and wish you didn't sit in the first place… just when you feel you can't take it,it becomes slow again.It picks up the pace again and this time you manage, you know what is coming, you tightly hold your partner's hand and enjoy the sharp turns,twists, and the sudden drops.Then it finally stops.You feel secure,happy, breathing normally, glowing after the heady rush of adrenaline and you want to do it again.You are no longer fearful. You are ready to take many more such journeys. It's fun, it's happiness,it's sunshine,it's breeze.You just grew, you just discovered what you can endure, you just became confident after each round of hardships.At any given time,my choice would be the exciting, the scary, the spectacular, the unpredictable roller coaster ride we call marriage.With all its constraints, with all its limitations, in all its splendor.
What would you prefer, staying single or marrying someone? Why?
Living the life of a single adult orphan in India-Bhaveen Sheth-DOTSIM-Indian MGTOWOrphans have never had it easy ,especially in India.Children without parents grow up being neglected, uncared, unloved, exploited and unwanted.Some children become orphans at the time of their birth while others become during some phase of their lives.Losing your loved ones at a young age is not easy and combine that with no support from near relatives, life is indeed difficult.As a writer of this blog titled as "The diary of the single Indian male", I would like to share my own experiences living the life of an adult orphan.Now at the age of 35 , I have very much accepted my destiny. I don't know if I will ever find a soul mate.What is it be an adult orphan in India?What is to live a wretched or cursed life? In the words of the famous Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky "Hell is living a life without ever being loved or being able to love someone". This statement sums up the lives of adult orphans. Yes, we adult orphans are living a life of hell.At my age life has become a sort of routine: wake up, get dressed, go to work, come back, read books, watch movies and go to http://sleep.Am I not a human being? Don't I have any feelings?There are times when I wish that there was that special someone by my side. There is a wish to see a wonderful smile of a caring woman in the morning, but there is none. Empty rooms is something that I have always been coming back to after work.It has been so many years where I have had only loneliness to greet me.Initially it was difficult, now I have got used to loneliness.As an adult orphan in India, you are pretty much on your own.You don't find much support in the society. There is no one in whom you can confide in, no one to share your feelings.A solitary life is forced upon you.What is it that you miss as an adult orphan?You miss the human touch. Something that makes you feel http://human.It can be a hug, an embrace, a face to face interaction , anything that shows someones love towards you. You have no one to feel for you.Whatever feelings you have just get stored into you for years to come.The society deprives you of a soul mate just because you are an adult orphan.When was the last time you loved someone and she reciprocated her feelings? This is something that a majority of adult orphans are deprived of. A difficult life filled with hardships makes you pragmatic. You are not able to understand the fantasy of love that other normal people have. I guess, we adult orphans are too realistic with life. But that does not mean that we cannot love or care for someone.There are times when we want to have a meaningful relationship, there are times when we wish to be a part of a social gathering, unfortunately we have been denied This an adult orphan you have to live the hard way and accept certain bitter realities of life.Being single post 30, you are bound to face ostracism, criticism and acerbic comments. Not being married after a certain age marks you as an odd man in the society. A single man post 30 working at a good position gets noticed by people.You get commented upon for your single status, people feel that there is something wrong with you. You don't want share your personal problems with anyone and if you did, no one one will empathize with you. Social isolation is something that you have to face.No one will invite you at any social function.People tend to forget that you are human being.Marriage is an integral part of life for everyone. Everyone gets married other than orphans.For adult orphans, the doors of marriage are closed.Your education, work, designation and salary does not Matter - Magazzini automatici does not matter that you are a self made man.All that matters is that you should belong to a decent well cultured family background. Hence we, adult orphans are nowhere possible suitors for a http://marriage.No one respects us for what we are. A few months back , a woman's father spoke to me and said "You have no parents, no relatives, how can I believe that you belong to a decent family background" As simple as that.And if you get a matrimonial interest, it will surely be from the dejected and rejected category of women who otherwise have no takers. It seems that people take our orphan status for granted and try to dump their unwanted daughters and sisters on us.Not a day goes by when you think why your life turned out like this.You question your destiny and faith in god.Why is a normal life denied to you when you have worked so hard?Why are you treated so differently? There is no answer to this. Your life is empty and you feel left out.And still in all this gloom, sadness and stoicism you see a ray of hope.You realize that if you have made it here all by yourself, there is a possibility that you will go far ahead. There is a lot more that you can do and lot that you can achieve.You work on yourself everyday in order to become a better person.You work on building wealth. People who understand you become your best friends, you develop good relations in the community.You immerse yourself in creative activities.You travel solo in order to explore new places and meet new people. At the end of your life you don't want to look back and have regrets.Lastly you don't give up on hope and strongly hold on to it knowing that one day there is going to be a positive outcome.This is Bhaveen Sheth signing off for the day and promise to be back with a lot more.BHAVEEN SHETH
This has always been my topic of interest and I have always wanted to discuss this at length with people. However, people mostly decide to chicken out of such discussions because they are scared of the truth.I will answer this question to the best of my ability and try to share my experiences of looking at singlehood and marriage from a distance . To answer this, I would like to categorise humans aged between 25–32 in the following categories :-Happily single with no desire to get married- A lot many of my friends are single and never bring up the topic of marriage . Their families are liberal and don't pressurise them to get married before a certain age . They are enjoying their singlehood and are very open about their activities like dating and getting to know different people .Single but desperate to get into a relationship/get married - You will always find them frustrated and on the hunt for women. They don't care about the person, his traits, compatibility or anything. They just want to get married or get into a relationship immediately .You will find their profile on http://Shaadi.com and they will be on tinder to find a life partner . Very difficult to talk to such people as their life revolves around marriage, job package and related topics.Committed but waiting for the right time to get married - My cousin is 32, works in the Beaurea of Indian Standards ,has a girlfriend for ages now, but for some reason they aren't getting married. Such people are probably waiting to get posted in the same city before taking things forward . Good people but a breakup at this age could spell doom.The “family will decide our husband/wife” type - This is mostly prevalent among certain communities in India . They will date as much as they can before marriage because they know the final decision has to be taken by his/her parents.I clearly remember a classmate who broke up just before leaving university after being in a relationship for three years. The reason she told me was “ultimately gharwale hi thik karenge “ . Extremely obnoxious, but very much prevalent in our nation.So these are the four broad types into which I can categorise people. Now , I will give out my personal opinion on marriage and singlehood and also relationships because I genuinely feel that arrange marriages are a farce and the most hypocritical thing that Indians do. It's more of a social arrangement than anything else.Marriage according to me should be done after giving a lot of thought behind it and the consequences that might follow. I personally believe that one should get into a relationship , followed by a live in relationship to know how good their compatibility is before taking such a major decision. Unfortunately, people pay more attention to issues like caste, family background and religion which are extremely trivial in front of compatibility and the ability to look twenty years into the future with your partner.Its high time that people took marriages seriously because, often, failed marriages have a huge impact on children and the entire family is affected by it. Don't get into a relationship, or get married because you feel lonely or you feel like you need a partner now. That's never going to result into something proper. Get married when you are at your mental and physical best , when you know you are ready and can give your level best into a relationship.I hope I have been able to bring out my opinion clearly :)Affairs and related issues are on the rise today and I believe that no one deserves to be cheated. Let honesty prevail and let there be happiness in lives :)
I've read many answers, and clearly most of them are biased.People tend to link happiness to simply being single or married.Happiness is doing what makes you happy. Period.People tend to look for happiness on outside things, like clothes, shoes, cars… Some do even worse and count on people to make them happy.Of course people can do things for us that will bring us joy, but you shouldn't put the responsibility of your happiness on anyone else's shoulders.If being single - doing all those “singley” things - makes you really happy, then you should remain single. The same goes for being married.It's not “being” one thing or another that will make you happy. It's what you do.You have to choose a life that will allow you to do the things that make you feel “alive”, whether it is being single or married.If you're a “lone wolf”, and are happy being that way, then remain single. Now, if you really feel like you should be in a “pack”, then find a partner, but not any partner. Find one that accepts you for what you are, and nothing less.Having a happy marriage is a matter of finding a person who understands and accepts the things you do that make you happy, without trying to change or to “better” you.So many marriages fail because people believe that after getting married a “switch” is flipped, then the spouses suddenly stop loving the things they did when they were single, and start loving only the “spousey” things.The woman believes her future husband will stop loving to play soccer with his friends, when he has fun doing and talking about “manly” things. And the man believes his future wife will stop loving going shopping with her friends, when she has fun doing and talking about “girly” things. It doesn't work like that.The examples above may vary, but the idea is the same: you shouldn't have to stop being yourself after getting married.Another reason so many marriages fail is that people believe that everyone is fit to be a good spouse.It's nice to say that you can be anything you want, but it's not that simple. I have a friend who is just terrified of insects, especially spiders. He doesn't want to, but I find it hard to believe that he would make a good entomologist even if he wanted to.My brother has two sons (23 and 17). Now, he is an “acceptable” father, but when they were little, it was plain to see - even for a passer-by - that he shouldn't have had kids, since he had zero patience and caring for them. Even so, we always hear people saying that everyone can be a good parent.I don't think I'd be a good father. I'm kind of selfish, and not very patient with kids. And I'd hate having to plan everything putting the kids safety and well-being above everything else. I'd be being selfish if I decided to have kids and ended up treating them bad.I have a couple of friends with kids and they hardly ever do anything as adults, quite different from what it was before the kids. It's almost cost their marriage more than once, although we always thought they were really made for each other.As their friends, we try to support them, but we'd rather not have kids around when we travel or have get-togethers. Anyway, we make an effort for the sake of their sanity.Long story short: do what makes you happy. This is happiness. Whether it be by yourself or with a partner.
What is better, married or to be single?
A2AWell both has its Pros and Cons…singles believe that married life is better and married people think the other way round …If you are a person who gets gets irritated even over little things, if ur damn selfish and always believe in self love-self gains and requires too much of personal space better be singleLets make a check listIf you can eat burned rotti and salty curry once in a while with a smileIf you have the heart to share the chores and play with the kids for sometimeIf you can be committed to ur girl and to ur childrenIf you can consider her problem yours and ur kids problems as ur own and can be there whenever they need youMy dear you as a married person can be happy- it’s always the little things that keeps a family moving forward- there can be exceptions as wellNow on the other sideIf you are a perfectionist and want all things to go as perfect as you areYou plan to marry bcos its time or that’s how it is or say bcos society will question you… pls dontIf you are a very busy person and ur carrier and self growth is alone important, multitasking say family and job can’t go hand in handIf you think kids can be annoying, hard to change diapers; u hate ur house being messy then pls don’t even think about…they love messy things - even a neatly combed hair is seen as challenge to be taken up.If you think sorry and compromises are words not necessary and needs to be only used by ur spouseMy dear pls don’t get married bcos married life includes lots of sacrifices- sharing and caring from both the partnersFinal NoteYou might be a wonderful person, love kids, eat burned foods and extremely caring and sweet person but that again doesn’t mean you have to get married. After all marriage is a label. Are all married couples following their vows and are all singles really being single???If you feel the need- if you feel so-if you think you as a married person is more of complete person and being single makes you feel like u miss something…then its time to seek someoneSometimes one decides to stay single forever but again one fine day you could also wake up missing your heart…chase after the person who stole your heart…and your story and path just changes….Let things happen on its own… :-)

What are some tips for people wanting to get married?
Don’t Get MarriedIf you’re not ready to delay gratification when your are angry. To hold your tongue, lower your voice and sometimes wait till the appropriate time, day or even month before you can deal with an issue thoroughly…. don’t get married. Immaturity is the inability to delay gratification. Marriage is for the mature.If you’re not ready to leave center stage and allow someone else to become your focus, your study, your muses… don’t get married. Selfish people make very bad spouses. In marriage you don’t lose yourself but your heart has to be big enough to gain someone else. And soon, with God’s blessing: little, crying, diaper soiling, demanding little ones are coming!If you are not ready, to stand up and calmly deal with meddling in-laws as a united front: The opinionated sister, the insensitive uncle, the domineering father, the manner less brother, the nosy aunt….. don’t get married. Boundaries do not exist automatically, they must be created. A good spouse is committed to respectfully stand up for and protect their marriage from meddling relatives. Don’t abandon your spouse to your relatives. It’s betrayal.If you are not ready to pay bills…. don’t get married. Love does not pay bills. PHCN will not give a waiver because your love is Oh so strong and your gazes at each other, Oh so romantic.If you are not ready to let go of your opposite sex “best friends” and invest that into your spouse. To like, to laugh, to play, to be silly and to enjoy life with them, above anyone else… don’t get married. Affairs happen because people did not marry their best friends. Someone else holds their heart. Someone else 'gets' them better. Someone else inspires them more. Marry your best friend and cultivate your friendship so that you remain best friends.If you are not ready to stop competing with the Joneses…. don’t get married. Let the Joneses buy their yatch when you are still walking, and enjoy the walk. Your journeys are different. They may have to cross the oceans but you may be going through the road route. A boat might not do you any good on your journey. You must be ready to pace yourselves: stop competing, stop spending your future before you get there, stop the debt, stop trying to impress people. You must be able to be content. To enjoy your journey without deciding your happiness simply by measuring your progress against other people.If you are not ready to be an open book. To tell the whole story of your past, deal with the memories, expose the failures and risk rejection…. don’t get married. It is fraud to have someone sign off their life to you without the full details. The past is a touchy and demanding friend. It always shows up in the marriage. It doesn’t enjoy being ignored and the more you snob, the bolder it becomes and the more tantrums it throws. It will mess up the “neat” and “all together lovely” image that you are struggling to maintain.If you are not ready to let go of your philandering and wild oats farming…. don’t get married. Don’t take somebody’s son or daughter and subject them to your germs, your indiscretions and your 'chips fungaz'. It never ends well. It’s romanticized in the movies, it’s being fronted as the only “realistic” way to stay married and keep the fire burning. But truth be told, the only thing that the fire will burn will be you, your spouse and your children. That family will burn for generations in bitterness, disease, fear, failure, hatred, broken hearts, broken dreams and conniving.Finally, if you are not ready to let go of the adrenalin rush of a risque life and to settle down…. don’t get married. The great Colombus [who we were told "discovered" America, Have you ever wondered if the Native Indians who were in it, knew that it existed ] had a diary that was long sought for. People wanted to read about the wild journeys, the sea tempest, the reckless pirates they fought, the death and the danger they must have encountered. When it was found, there was great disappointment. Majority of the pages simply had 5 words: “This day, we sailed on.”.Marriage, like life in general, has many “we sail on” days. You have to learn to find the thrill in the normal 'everydayness' of it.If you depend on wild romance, all night sex [ha], romantic cruises, wild parties, compulsive moves across continents, tempestuous fights and make up sessions to be happy, you may be disappointed. You have to learn to thrill in gentle smiles, loving hugs, knowing looks, cozy moments, shared chores, cute babies, everyday work, dreaming together, praying together and simply living together. If these things are not thrilling, exciting and satisfying, you will look for a way out. The “boom twaff” moments are still there, but they are normally punctuations to the 'usualness' of living. They cannot be your reason for getting married. They are unsustainable on an everyday basis. The one you choose must be thrilling to you even in the most mundane of moments.I pray this helps someone. Remember singles, YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOICE. Never let anyone pressure you into marriage. You are either ready or you’re not: You decide!. But please don’t marry somebody and then punish them to live with your childish ways for the rest of their lives . A childish baby is cute but a childish adult is extremely frustrating.Marriage is for the mature and in many ways, the married are still being confronted with the demand to grow up day by day. If you are not ready for that demand, don’t get married!!!!

My therapist told me this. Always put the feelings of your spouse before anyone else’s.Never argue till yr anger is gone.When angry go mow grass or walk. Even if yr spouse pushed,a button, never displace anger onto him or her.Spouses before children. Dont let the kids ‘divide and conquer.’Pray together and even if you have to stay up all night DO NOT GO TO BED ANGRY AT EACH OTHER. it lets resentments build.Remember always how precious and cherished your spouse is by you. Never never take them for granted.If you hate fishing and your spouse loves it, go fishing. Watch his face light up when he catches a fish. You being there will make his day. Learn how to clear down the bloodline,etc chop off the head etccooking together is fun.Make,sure the kids stick to their bedtimes so you guys can have quiet time.Compromise and dont always be the taker go back and forth with giving.Ladies go with your man’s sexual fantasies. Guys, you too.please never say, “If you don’t lije it you can leave.” Do not talk that way to your beloved.Never use sarcasm.Fight clean: no name calling no bringing up old stuff, always use “I” statements (“you” is being aggressive; “I” is assertiveRemember to fix the problem not the blame.If you want to take 2 classes per semester and your husband wants to be able to see you more, only take 1 class per semester.PUT YOUR MARRIAGE FIRST. There are 3 entiries in the marriage: you, your spouse, and your marriage.PUT YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOUR AND HIS PARENTS. YOU GOTTA.Date night. Notes in lunch. Little bring home gifts red rose now and then keep your romance. Remember this is your beloved.Remember when you argue? YOU ARE BOTH ON THE SAME,SIDE!!!!!!!!!!!°°Always,always say i love you before you leave the house. Stay current. (No lingering disagreements.) Remember how long it took you to find each other. And, you never know,when God,will call you home.
What are some tips for young people wanting to get married?
I agree with all of Marcus Geduld's tips here. I wish I could print them out and put them on the wall about the desk of the 20-something man I once was. Would have saved some heartache. I'll take a slightly different angle here but I wanted to honor his advice first. Marriage is an incredibly complex and even paradoxical thing. On the one hand, in our current Western culture, at least in the US, we marry for love. We marry the person we are "in love with" at the point when we think we are ready to be married, or feel the need to be married, or whatever it is that causes someone to make the leap of faith of commiting one's whole life to a partnership with another person. Marriage is also a social compact, a merging of families and finances, an agreement to leave one's own home and family and start a new home and family.  Getting married to someone you are head over heels in love with is pretty easy. Making a marriage work for the length of the vow one takes--until death do us part--is hard work, at least for most of us.  So, one thing to consider is that the state of being "in love" is rooted in our lizard brain--it is all feeling, emotion, perception, scent, need, hunger, etc. The first flush of it can be so intense it is almost like a disease--all that desire and hunger, the constant wanting of contact, the sex, the sense that the other person is perfect and can do no wrong, etc. It may be possible to create a great marriage without ever having fallen into this state, but in general, that is rare. Most marriages begin in a sense that the other person is the center of the universe. And this doesn't last, at least for most people--not because of some flaw in them, but because of the biology and neuroscience of it. And this is why so many marriages end, just as most relationships end.  My personal sense--my advice--would start by saying that you should make sure you are really, really "in love" with the person you marry. Even though the intensity of those feelings will diminish over time, they will also, in the most important way imaginable, always be a reference point. Being in love at the first instance is like a huge fire, and it will die down. Work comes, bills come, children come, parents die, etc., and the fire will dwindle in these winds. But if it was truly there to start, those embers are always present, and can always be rekindled, if only in smaller and briefer ways. But being in love with someone is not a good reason to marry them. There has to be a second condition, and this one is more rarely thought of. Marriage is a contract you enter into with a partner, a contract with broad and steep requirements, the hardest of which is that you stay true to your vows. To accomplish this means that you must also genuinely like, trust, respect, admire, and honor the person with whom you are in love. You need to be certain that you will always have their back, and that they will always have yours. You need to be willing to fight, to give in, to compromise, to disagree, to do hard work when you don't feel like it, to put someone else ahead of yourself even as you are willing to demand that someone else put you ahead of themself. And that both of you are willing to put the union, the marriage--the business, the enterprise--ahead of one's own selfish desires. I don't know whether it is possible to really have a sense of what someone will be like at forty, after a couple of kids, when you are dazzling her with your wit and charm at 26. I think it has to be an intuitive thing. But my one piece of deepest advice would be to ask yourself, not "am I in love with this person?"--that should be a given--but "would I trust him, or her, with my life, my child, my money, etc." And also, "do I like her?"  Somewhere the state of being in love and the state of liking someone meet, amidst the difficulty of what it is to be an adult in this world--and the state that results is love.
I went to a friend’s wedding and the minister said something I never forgot:“A good marriage is many things over time. It’s sex, it’s quiet love, it’s joy, it’s anger, it’s suffering, it’s bliss, it’s sadness, it’s fighting and making up and sleeping alone or together but the one thing it always comes down to is a decision - the decision to stay together in the faith that what was once good can be good again.”Another thing of many I learned:My missus and I went through a rough patch years ago and we went to marriage counseling. I was skeptical but watching her shake and cry and reveal things I never knew changed my opinion of her from some monster specifically designed to make my life a living hell to simply another human being struggling with her own demons.“Everyone you meet is fighting battles you know nothing about.” Even those closest to you.Don’t keep those battles to yourself, no matter how embarrassing. Humbling yourself, sharing your fear, your past, the person you are inside - strengthens a marriage. Don’t have a spouse personality and a YOU personality. Be yourself, warts and all. If you pretend to be someone you aren’t and are loved for it, what have you won?Accept change.When I came home from the key counseling session where my wife shook and cried after revealing something I didn’t know, something so traumatic for her that she can’t even remember that counseling session happened, it changed everything.I went to my bookshelf, to my favorite picture of her, and I took it down. The person in the picture no longer existed. I kissed the picture, then I tore it up. I decided I’d better let that person go and get busy learning how to get along with the person I was living with NOW.Don’t get complacent. Take a break now and then and just enjoy the peaceful stretches, but then get back to it. Marriage is work and it’s worth it.

What are some tips for young people wanting to get married?
There's a lot of good advice here. Some I agree with, some I don't. What Marcus Geduld mentioned about being intellectually, morally, financially aligned makes a lot of sense. I can't agree about living together or trying sex before marriage. There's a lot of merit to keeping it celibate before marriage, and not cohabiting. Rutgers' Institute for Families Research has some pretty interesting studies that talk about this. 1. People who cohabit have a higher divorce rate and report lower levels of marital satisfaction. This research has been criticized because cohabitation has traditionally not been an option, but up to now there is no solid research that I know of disputing it. 2. A level of maturity, education, and financial stability will help with your marriage, but marrying too old can actually hurt you. The State of Our Unions 2011  This study also points out that religious affiliation lowers your likelihood of divorce, but some will argue that this is because some religions shame couples into staying married. In the end, my wife and I pretty much ignored every aspect of conventional wisdom for a good marriage. We were very young (19 and 21), very poor, uneducated (though we did finish college), and we waited until marriage to have sex. Here we are, 10 years later, still married. I don't say this to be arrogant, but to point out that advice is just that - advice. You'll have to figure out what works for you. What has worked for us (so far): improving our communication skills - I can't over-emphasize this enough. We worked really, really hard at this. Weekly one-on-one time. Whether its dates, doing chores together, or just talking, this has been a way for us to connect during our busy lives. Sunday afternoons are absolutely sacrosanct. Becoming financially secure.
What are some tips for young people wanting to get married?
Okay: everyone's different so my tips aren't universally good advice. Slip them on over your personality and see if they fit.1. If you're desperately lonely, as I was when I was younger, here's what you don't know and may refuse to believe: being in a bad relationship is worse than being horribly lonely. So my number-one tip is don't settle! If warning bells are ringing, don't throw a sheet over them, push them into a corner, and try to ignore them. Go on being lonely a bit longer. Trust me, it's better than the alternative. (Don't settle means don't marry someone who, in some important way, makes you unhappy now -- hoping or trusting that will change. Assume the problem that exists now will always exist. I'm not talking about petty annoyances. It's okay to settle for someone who leaves the toilet seat up, unless that fills you with unbridled rage.)2. Before you marry someone, make sure he or she is your friend. Don't get married first and hope friendship will come later.3. Finances, children, family, friends, drugs/alcohol, gambling (and other addictions), politics, and religion can be contentious issues. Have you and your intended talked about them? Are you comfortable with a joint bank account? Separate bank accounts? Do you both want kids? Do you both want to stay childless? Is your mom important to you but loathed by your intended? What if your mom gets sick and has to move in with you? Does your intended hate your best friend? Etc. If you have major conflicts in these areas, don't just expect them to get better.4. Is there something sexual you're afraid talking about? Do you have secret S&M fantasies? Talk about it now. If you don't, it will either come out way later in your marriage and your partner will be blindsided by it or you'll live in the closet, which will suck for you and for your spouse. He or she may never know, but your tension will mount, and that will be obvious. Whatever you do, don't say, "I'll just keep it to myself for the rest of my life." You won't -- or you will and you'll be a mess.5. Make sure you spend time living together before you agree to marry. Some people work as housemates; others don't -- even if they love each other.6. Get to know each other sexually before marriage. Are you compatible? 7. Picture this: your intended gets into a terrible accident and becomes paralyzed. He or she can no longer have sex with you, and you'll have to take care of him or her for the rest of your life. Are you up for that?8. Spend a year or two communicating about everything. Everything. Set up a pattern of doing this. There should never be a time, later, when you "grow apart" or one of you says, "He's changed" or "I don't know her any more." If you communicate every day, for the rest of your lives, that can't possibly happen. Neither of you is ever allowed to blindside the other, no matter how hard something is to talk about.9. Pledge to each other that you'll get help if you need it. Don't be those stupid people who could have saved their marriage with the help of a therapist but didn't. 10. Work on a huge, multi-month long project together -- something really difficult for both of you that required teamwork. Can you be good partners under pressure?11. Make sure you fight well. You will get into fights. Can you recover from them? Do you fight dirty? Does your intended fight dirty? Is either of you passive-aggressive? Does either of you sulk for days afterwards.12. How compatible are you in terms of clinginess? Do you both require the same level of affection? Or is one of you more independent than the other? How will you cope with that? 13. If there's something that annoys you about your intended, do not go into a marriage thinking he or she will change. Assume no change will ever happen and this is the way it will be for the rest of your life.14. Are both of you committed to this for life? You never know what will happen, but are you committed, or is this a "let's try it and see what happens" proposition? That might be okay, but only if you both feel that way. Don't hope to win someone over after marriage. What are your expectations about marriage? Did your parents stay together? Did your intended's stay together. Do both of you strongly believe in marriage?
What are some tips for young people wanting to get married?
Expect love. Do not decide in advance what love should look like, or you will be filled with resentment when you guess wrong. You will be surprised by the ways your spouse shows it. If you pay your attention to the negative surprises (like ending up with more than 50% of the chores or having less sex than you want or not agreeing on furniture choices), there will be fewer positive surprises (like getting the encouragement you need to climb to the top of your profession or getting to be the father you wished yours was or living with a lot more laughter in your life).Contrary to some of the other posters' advice, statistically your odds of a long or happy marriage are not improved by a pre-marriage trial living together. Instead, develop some skill at finding Third Alternatives to your disagreements. Working on those around living arrangements is great practice for the bigger things that come up later in marriage, so don't choose a spouse for your roommate compatibility. And don't assume what you want in the way of sex now is what you will always want, either. I agree with the others that you should not marry anyone you hope to change. Choose someone with the sort of character strengths you will admire for a lifetime and encourage them to grow stronger in these strengths, not develop different ones.
10 Tips for people wanting to get marriedIt does not matter if you have been dreaming concerning the large day for ages, or solely recently started amusive the concept of obtaining hitched — their square measure positively some things to stay in mind before getting married. Attributable to all the selections in life, promising to pay it with another person is just about as huge because it gets.Of course, the choice to induce married suggests that various things to entirely different folks, therefore the beginning in puzzling over the complete method is deciding what it all suggests that to you. If you are presently single or dating, then congrats! You've got loads of time to pause for to a small degree reflection.But once you catch up with to the significant day, it's clearly about to be necessary to incorporate your partner within the convo, as well. "Ask your partner what their desires and expectations are when your square measure married [and] verbalize your desires and expectations for when you're married," says accredited psychotherapist Kim Chronister, PsyD, in Associate in the Nursing email to Bustle.You guys ought to feel comfy talking concerning everything and something. And once you're, it {is a} mighty sensible sign that moving forward is a reasonable plan. However till that day, here square measure some tips to stay in mind, must you see yourself eventually fastening the knot.1. Don't SettleIt may desire the proper factor to try and do, particularly if you are falling victim to social pressures to marry by an exact age. However no matter you are doing, do not settle. It means higher to be alone, or lonely, than it's to be with somebody United Nations agency is not an honest work, causes you issues, or does not share your beliefs. As Marcus Geduld same on HuffPost - Breaking News, U.S. and World News, "... don’t marry somebody United Nations agency, in some vital means, causes you to sad currently — hoping or trusting that my amendment. Assume the matter that exists now can continually exist." And if it's an.2. Make Sure You Feel Complete On Your OwnGoing off that initial tip, certify you're feeling OK being on your own before you burst seeking company. Speaking regarding somebody World Health Organization is prepared to induce married, Chronister says, "They feel secure with themselves, have a full life, and feel targeted even once their partner is away." just the once you've got that down, must you think about obtaining hitched.3. Give Living Together A TryIf you can, strive cohabitation before walking down the aisle. It's excellent thanks to taking a look at your compatibility, and see one another in your grossest (read: trust) forms. It is also true thanks to taking a look at your relationship, particularly if it does not go well. As Geduld aforesaid, "Some individuals work as housemates; others don’t — albeit they love one another." the selection to maneuver forward is up to you. However, shared room woes are positively one thing you wish to figure on sooner, instead of later.4. Consider Your SO's FamilyWhen you hook up with, you are not just obtaining a replacement husband or woman, however complete relations. And, of course, everything that comes with them. "You're inheritable the obligations, stresses, and, yes, benefits, of a full new family," same Melanie Pinola on Lifehacker - Tips, tricks and downloads for getting things done. confirm you are pleased with adopting these new folks into your life, as a result of you are going to be seeing plenty of them.5. Think About Their Future PersonalityPeople get set in their ways in which as they age (think regarding your oldsters real quick). Therefore use your imagination and movie what your partner may be like in 10, 20, or thirty years. "If your partner is somewhat of an old person currently, he or she's going to become crankier most likely solely and a lot of stubborn because the years elapse," Pinola above. "Conversely, the simplest stuff you love a few person might hold you steady through the inevitable powerful times."6. Figure Out How You Both Deal With StressLike some, you are going to travel through plenty of stress along —deaths, births, job changes, moves. That is why it's unbelievably necessary to visualize however your partner handles pressure, also as however, you guys take care of it together; do they use exercise as a variety of stress relief? Prayer? One thing else entirely? As Chronister says, "... it's imperative to understand however somebody reacts to fret before you step into a wedding. Stress from work or loss will produce disturbance on a relationship if a partner is unwilling to utilize acceptable cope mechanisms."7. Be Ready To ChangeYou shouldn't marry somebody expecting them to alter, and you should not let anyone change your values or opinions. However being a part of a semipermanent couple suggests that being willing to bend to a small degree. "The two biggest things square measure learning the way to fight a lot of fruitfully and the way to speak in ways in which may not be natural to you, however, build a lot of sense to the opposite person," Pinola same. In different words, be able to adapt, for the sake of your relationship.8. Get Ready To Get GrossYou shouldn't marry someone expecting them to change, and you must not let anyone amendment your values or opinions. But being a section of a long couple suggests that being willing to bend to the alittle degree. "The two biggest things unit of measurement learning the thanks to fighting lots of profitably and also the thanks to speaking in ways that during which might not be natural to you, however, build lots of sense to the alternative person," Pinola same. in several words, be ready to adapt, for the sake of your relationship.9. Figure Out If You Like Sharing EverythingI'm certain there area unit couples WHO have agreements concerning time apart, or separate living arrangements. However typically, obtaining married means that sharing everything, as a result of it is a partnership. Speaking concerning healthy couples, Chronister says, "They feel comfy revealing a good deal of private data to their partner and feel supported as a result." make certain whoever you finish up with is down for all of the higher than.10. Decide Now If You'd Like KidsAgain, each couple is completely different. Therefore it isn't invariably necessary to work everything out before a wedding. However huge things — like whether or not or to not have youngsters — ought to in all probability be mentioned. Not everybody needs to create babies, therefore if you finish up with somebody WHO urgently does not need to multiply, then you may have a retardant on your hands. Therefore figure this out for yourself beforehand, and apprehend whether or not or not your partner has done identically.
What are some tips for young people wanting to get married?
Some of what I'm going to say I've already mentioned in the habits that happy couples have.You need to be on the same page about several things:MoneyIt doesn't matter how you decide to handle it, joint accounts, separate accounts, or what I did, but both of you have to agree. Money causes arguments, about how to spend it, on what to spend it, who gets to spend it and it can all be avoided by sitting down and talking about it and coming to an agreement.The agreement solved our problem. When I was working I had two sources of income; my money and his money. This wasn't working for him. This is how we solved it.He turned all the finances over to me and I'm responsible for them. It's not as much fun as it sounds ladies. SpaceI know that it seems like you can't bear to be apart for one minute but that will change, trust me. When it does, you'd better have some rules in place so that if he wants to go out to play poker with the boys and you want a spa weekend with the girls, no one feels left out, angry or jealous.Steve has a home office and he remotes into his real office. There have been times that he's been swamped and I barely see him. When I had my business I worked crazy hours every day. We were in the same house and barely saw each other.We made it into a study date. He'd walk by and make sure that I was still alive and we'd make time for dinner. He would ask me if I was tired of studying and I knew that he had to "cram" for his final exam, which was whatever case he was working on, so I said that I had more studying to do - it was a compact that we made and it worked for us.Find out what works for you, space-wise, so that no one feels left out.Sex (Oh God, we knew the old lady would get to it sooner or later.)It won't always be the way it is today. I don't care if today is when you're dating, the first 6 months you're married or looking at 42 years of being married, nothing stays the same, sex-wise.I don't care how many leg lifts you do or crunches, or donkey kicks, always a personal favorite of mine, this is what I know for sure:You cannot Pilates, treadmill, marathon, triathlon, aerobic class, yoga class, Bikram or otherwise, swim, bike, hike, box, or eschew lox - you are not going to look like you do now. Deal with it. Whether from gravity or depravity the result is the same, nature is not kind to us.You'd better have a partner that loves you for who you are and not what you look like. You'd better feel the same way about your partner.You'd better feel that way about yourself. Those perky breasts will not be perky for long after several children and yes, they can be lifted and separated but I'll let you in on a little secret, when you get to be my age, ancient, and that's all that's perky, it looks really strange. I don't know because I never had any to perk so it wasn't an issue, but my friend, sad. Knees on the shins, tummy on the thighs and breasts pointing towards heaven supporting her chin. Oh my.A final word...If you'll let me copy and paste and update a little, I like what I said on my other post:Be kind to each other. Be respectful. Be playful, be nice, be all the things you want the other person to be and guess what, 41 years go by and you'll still be laughing. One more thing, be grateful everyday for the other person and let them know that. That's all! Right, that's all.

It happens all the time when the wife or girlfriend doesn’t know how to cuddle or show loving affection to her man. The man cries out for some love and affection but the wife/girlfriend doesn’t reciprocate. The man can’t always initiate love/sexual thoughts to his woman because it might characterize him as horn dog.
Never alone, but rather unfulfilled. Being with wring person who doesnt share the same values and is at diffrent intelligence level can be very tiring.

Can living alone be depressing?
Loneliness isn’t for all, I mean, not everyone enjoys it.Yes, at times it get depressing, because, in some cases your inner chat goes to a point where it seeks companion to share your feelings or to get moral support from. And if you don’t have one, that particular one or a group, it’ll hit you like a train! That’s the worst feeling, irrespective of how confident and self-reliant you are, you cannot handle it. You’ll break down.I am not talking about Narcissism, that’s a different thing and I have no idea on their world.In my case I’ve been alone for so long that I understood the nature of depression, especially about myself and when I might fall into it, I closely watch for the early signs and stop it before it hits me. Mostly I’ll divert my mind by doing something that keeps me engaged until I get rid of that feeling.-So why a person has to do all this? Why one has to live alone? What’s the point in it when you can mingle with everyone, be social and live with friends?-For some people, it’s not as easy as it sounds, because they love quality in life, not quantity, they cherish meaningful things, valuable relationships and importantly, people with values. These things are very particular to us just like how particular we want our lives to be.We live by values and seek the same, when we don’t find it outside, we isolate ourselves in our worlds.Depression hits when you realize your world has no one in it but you. You kept listening to your voice all the time and all you could hear now are your echos, and you want your world to breakdown, not because it isn’t beautiful, but it is the same and you seek something new.For some, living alone is natural because they are very content with themselves, for some it starts with a traumatic experience in the past, for some it starts with lacking quality in life so create they own world for themselves.-Yes, it gets depressing and when you know how to overcome it you’ll only get more stronger, mentally.

Why does living alone lead to depression?
Living alone can be a double edged sword. On one side, it will give you that satisfaction that you are alone and you do things at your will and it gives you that feeling of being independent. On the other side, you might start feeling lonely(especially if you are alone for a longer time) and that feeling may begin to get to you and trigger depression.As the people who answered before me have pointed out, it is all about the person. A person who really enjoys being alone may consider his loneliness to be solitude. But, lets say someone who is very outgoing and wants to be always with company may feel the loneliness get to him and this may trigger unwanted episodes. However, if there has been a previous experience of depression(before you decide to live alone), then living alone can most certainly trigger something again.Disclaimer: I am not a Psychiatrist. The views and opinions presented above are mine and from my personal experiencesThanks for the A2A.
It's probably better to just dive in and do it. You might be surprised by how your life changes once you're in it instead of imagining it. I'll say that for myself, living alone is wonderful. I am an extremely empathetic person by nature, so anytime I am around other people (even animals), I become hyperaware and tune into their well being. I am also overly analytical and observant, so other people become a stimulant for me, if not always on a conscious level, then most certainly subconsciously. There is nothing like going home to a still and quiet house. My mind is free to be itself, off galavanting and exploring in its own magical world, while my body is free to roam about as I wish. Living alone, in fact, helps prevent me from becoming depressed. It is in a way liberating. But it all comes down to perspective. This is my reality, it may not be yours.

I come from a large family, despite of needing space every now and then I was very used to being around my family. When I moved out for the first time at 18, it was a disaster. I was already depressed and it didn't help. my room mate had very active social life while I preferred being at home. I remember her being away for the whole weekend every week and loneliness drove me up the walls. Over time, I learned more about myself and what works for me. So when I moved again, it was amazing, well, also because I was about 7 years older and a lot more comfortable with myself. I learnt that while I wanted my days to be filled with buzz of busy and active social life, I need my evenings and nights to be quiet. I really enjoyed living alone because I knew I wasn't really lonely, merely in my comfort zone.

Is it depressing to live alone, how do you deal with it?
It can be depressing depending on your personality. Some people need a lot of alone time and enjoy being by themselves. Others need to be around people or they start to experience a lack of energy. Social isolation has been linked to depression, but living in social isolation doesn't necessarily mean you'll become depressed. There are a lot of other things that factor into if someone will get depression.
In and of itself, living alone is neutral with the general population. If you have experienced depression in the past there is higher risk, not that the situation will necessarily cause depression but that you will not have anyone to help you if something triggers that downward spiral again. People can find that the reduction in stress from not having to give up control of part of their personal space is enough to avoid depression. I agree with the answer that it depends on the individual. You may do fine, just recognize the risk and seek help earlier than you may have before.  
Can it be?Yes.Ex:I had to babysit my little brother for a week one time while our parents had to go off somewhere. He's severely mentally handicapped, so while he is definitely a human and capable of speech beyond a doubt, I had never felt so lonely before. I ate lunch at a bakery while he was in school. By myself.I just wanted to bawl.Thankfully, that only lasted a week.The upside is, it doesn't have to be a bad thing. I know of a lot people that live by themselves and are completely content and happy with it.

Can I be happy if I never get married?
Of course you can. Here's a little story - When she was little, my aunt was a very bright child. Always bagging the top scores at school, doing well in all subjects. She graduated with distinction in computer science, academics was her talent. But she wasn't very good at socialising. An introvert girl, she had just a couple of friends throughout her school and college life. She worked hard and applied for a job to the United States. She was now of age for marriage, friends and family began to pester her parents to get her engaged. Proposals started to flood through, but none seemed to work for her. People around her would judge her, talk ill about the decisions she made. Everyone told her parents that a woman cannot live without a companion, women are dependent on men. She will regret that she's letting go of all the good proposals, and will feel lonely as she gets older. Nobody will marry her once she's beyond 30. She stood her ground. Ignored all the taunting, while her parents supported her will to not get married. She had ambitions she wanted to pursue, she saw no reason to get married. She wasn't against the concept of marriage, it just wasn't the best for her! She moved to the USA, got promoted to better companies and earned well, sending the money to her parents so their healthcare would never be compromised. She bought her own house, a plush car, and she went shopping on weekends. She is now an independent woman of 50, and a life of independence is what defines normalcy and happiness for her! She has her circle of friends, and is always utmost excited when family visits. From her I learned to never live by stereotypes, everyone has the right to follow what their heart wants! Happiness is not a destination, it's a journey. Follow your heart and intuitions, dont set rules for yourself. Marriage comes with highs and lows, the single life accompanies pros and cons too. It's your perception and choices that matter.

Can I live without getting married?
The question says "Can I live without getting married".Whether you can live without getting married is up to you. It depends on how badly you need it or don't need it. We will not be able to tell whether you will survive well without marriage or not. That only you can decide and experience. Don't relate your situations with anyone else. Don't change your mind because someone else has done it. If you don't want to get married you will have to convey your decision to people who are concerned about you and see you getting married anytime in future. They can be your parents/relatives/gf/bf anyone. I am a married person and I can tell for sure (and only for myself) that there is nothing which I could have not done without getting married. I care for a person as if I would have done for myself. I think about a person whether she had food on time or not, whether she is getting proper rests or not, whether she is emotionally/mentally/physically happy with me or not, There are N number of things which I do just for one person and that's my wife. The point is that I could have done all these without getting married too but Indian society needs acceptance of a relationship in form of a marriage.You have not mentioned, what do you think about marriage and why did this question pop in your mind? Remember, marriage is not only about sharing the same bed. Its sharing your life with ups and downs. Sharing your happiness and sharing the other persons sadness. You should become the sole shoulder when they are sad and want to cry. You should be the sole listener when no one hears whats running in their mind. You should feel incomplete without the other person. I am not sure whether I answered your question or not, but for sure no one can tell you whether you will be able to live your life till the end without marriage. I assume everyone needs a person with whom they can open up their heart and mind without being judged. If you have that person and will stay till your last breath, then life is good with you. At some point, you might see your friends/colleagues/cousins/neighbours getting married and having kids etc. You might feel that you are missing on something. It can be true only if you allow it to. Marraige comes with lots of trust and courage. Trust to build a strong base and courage to continue the relation in whatever situation life throws at you.If you don't want to get married, don't. But sometimes, some decisions cannot be reversed. Time does not allow it. All the best for your life.A2A.Answered for "Can I live without getting married?"
Yes it is possible. Infact like everything in life all marriage has its ups and downs. Many people would like to live alone to keep their life hasslefree . They can have live-in freinds who are as independent as them but they will satisfy each others needs, physical or distantly emotional too. for a fixed period of time. OR one can live alone without any emotional dependence and keep his physical needs satisfied through some other natural ways.If you wants to marry you are buying lot of color in life which will fade sooner than you think. Marriage is the most misused institution in the world. If male you will be the first priority of your partner till you have children, suddenly after the first child you will fall into the last priority. You will have children whom you love, this is a compensation of the institution, but remember your children as they get independant will start to be individuals too and you will have lot of friction with them. One of the good thing about marriage is that you will support each other in old age. BUt remember one of you both may die earlier than another and again your problems will crop up you will be left alone or have to work hard to find a partner.This is the truth of relationships in a nutshell, many areas have not been touched here at all. But it is a succinct explanation of what happens in the world and mostly I am only referring to India.
Can I live without getting married?
You need to find that answer on your own.I’ll tell you how I found out that I didn’t like living alone. For a period of about 3 years I lived and worked in the USA. I lived in 3 states and shifted apartments 4 times. The experience was an eye-opener, to say the least.All 3 years, I loved my work, had great roommates and made amazing friends.Every month or alternate month we were travelling to new places.New Hampshire, Las vegas, LA, Disneyland, Orlando, Grand Canyon, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Tampa, Key West - We visited them all.Jet-skiing, para sailing, helicopter rides, camping, snorkelling, watching the fall colours, Segway city tours, seeing the New Years Ball drop - We did them all.I had the BEST time of my life. But, I always felt something was missing.The friends with whom I watched the fall colours in New Hampshire were not with me for New Year’s Ball drop. Those who wished me Happy New Year, were not there to see the fireworks at Disneyland. I felt that my amazing memories and life experiences were scattered with different people.Let me repeat, I liked all my trip-mates/room-mates. Till date, my best friends are those I met there and I still talk to them every week.But, I felt we were all moving in our respective trajectories, briefly meeting and having fun while our paths crossed. I missed having someone with whom I could share ALL my life experiences with, both mundane things like doing laundry and high adrenaline stuff like para gliding. I felt the lack of stability, and wanted to come home to the same person instead of a different roommate every year. I slowly liked the idea of a partner. That’s when I decided to get married.So go ahead, try doing everything you ever wanted to do (as long as safety and law permits of course) and see if you are satisfied. Somewhere along the way, you’ll realise if you need someone else in your life to enjoy it better or not.Good luck!

Can we live a happy life without marriage?
Definitely Yes. Happiness doesn't reside in marriage. And marriage is not the ultimate aim of life. We do get married with different reasons and some of us just like a machine with the flow of time and society with no reason.I wanted to get married as I had a great wish to celebrate the Big Day with all ornaments and beauty. It was a quite immatured wish but even I didn't get it fulfilled though I got married.Anyway I am Happy. Because it is my very nature I can't remain unhappy or sad for long. It is also the nature of all human beings. But we don't realise the truth. We don't become happy consciously.Another very reason behind the wish for marriage. Getting a good life partner , exactly the perfect. But does all get the required?Third and the long lasting traditional wish to be served by their children in the last stage of life when everyone is dependent on others. But does this really happen? We all know it better.In this busy world and busy life none sees the tomorrow. And there are so many things that can boost your happiness.“SERVING AMD HELPING OTHERS, PARTICULARLY THE NEEDY. “ The Best of all Happiness.My answer doesn't suit to all but hopefully the persons who think of being happy without marriage.And perfectly there are many personalities we know they lived happily without marriage.Dr. A.P. J. Abdul Kalam, Swami Vivekananda, Paramahansa Yogananda, Swami Rama and many more we know. They were much more happy and satisfied in their lives.
What is a happy life? Is it possible without marriage?
“The grass is always greener on the other side.”This goes very well with married as well as unmarried people.For eg; just visualise the scenario of the life of two best friends where one is married and the other is unmarried.Whenever something goes wrong in their lives, the thought will cross their mind that the other friend of theirs is so lucky..the unmarried friend would think the other person is so lucky. He would wish..hope he was married..whereas the married friend would think hope he was unmarried and free like his friend.Though an unmarried person may have an awesome social circle, according to me getting married and having one's own family is one of the most sensible thing a person does for a content life.Having your own family makes you feel complete.
Can we live a happy life without marriage?
Do you mean a happy life without marriage or a happy life without a long-term companion?Various studies in the Western world show that men fare better when they are partnered. They live longer, their quality of life is better, and they are happier than their single, unpartnered male peers. The reverse is true for females. Single, unpartnered females fare much better than partnered heterosexual females _and_ both partnered and unpartnered males. The consensus is that this has to do with gendered work in relationships—females end up taking on most of the effort of running the home and family as well as working outside the home. The reasons why women fought for property rights, the right to earn their own money, have their own bank accounts, etc outside of marriage were because for women, marriage was drudgery — and in many ways it still is. So, depending on your gender and orientation, marriage/domestic partnership may be less optimal for you.Life as a single person can be considerably less complicated than it is for those who are partnered. Much of what one wants to do, or avoid doing, is a matter of negotiation and compromise and scheduling when partnered. If simplicity is important to your happiness, you'll probably be happier single.But for most people, the desire for intimacy and connection is why we partner up. The joy of waking up to your skin sliding against another's, the comfort of going to sleep with someone in your arms, the knowledge that someone has your back emotionally as well as physically, having someone to talk to about your experiences, fears, and dreams — being able to be your true self with someone: open, vulnerable, maskless — is a gift to yourself and them. Being single, forgoing the kind of partnership that fulfills skin hunger and the spiritual desire for oneness — can be very lonely.We are social animals. While some people are hermits by nature, even hermits have companionship in the form of pets/livestock. We really aren't wired to be _alone_. But, provided one has a good support system, friends and family that meet our emotional needs and our needs for touch and connection, and interests to pursue, an unpartnered life can be a happy one.
Can I live without getting married?
This is a very vague question. Do you mean if you can live without officiating the relationship? Yes, but do you want to? Officialising things means both persons make a commitment toward each other in front of other people. Do you mean staying alone? Yes this is possible too, although especially harder for women. I know I will get a lot a flaming for this but once a woman passes a certain age between 30-40 (varies from person to person) the need for someone (and especially a child with that someone) becomes extreme and I have seen many women crack and go mental as a result. That is not to say it is not hard for guys too but in a different way. A man is truly powerful when he has something to fight for, something to protect. He may find this in other things too. A woman's strength is in being a wife and mother and this is why i is harder. We were taught a culture of hedonism, but usually after you pass a certain age you realize this is just a illusion and as someone said once you just want someone to be there when you are all old and tired and wrinkled.If we read the Genesis God says: "It is not good for man to be alone. Let's make a companion matched for him!" No matter what feminists try to tell you they are lies. Is very hard for a woman to find fullfilment if she is not a mother. Also you cannot have both a carrier and a family because time is limited. I am not saying marry the first person you run into. Far from it. You should try to determine if it is a person that will truly commit for this step.Hope my answer helps you!
In my book actually a marriage probably cause my unhappiness, first of all I'd always prefer to own the space in my bed and second of all, I would rather mind my time for my own business. I might get lonely but I always know many places to go away, I never feel scared to be alone.Having others problem makes me anxious and marriage always mean to share my time of the day. I am a good listener but I am not a good problem solver for issue that got nothing to do with me. I am a direct person so my approach could hurt others who are touchy feely.One day while I was in the car driving, another car cut my lane then rolled down the window and called me a B. I simply look at the driver and sure looks like someone from low uneducated class and I simply ignore like he's a fly I don't need to bother at all. That a marriage like for me. A few people don't have a high need to be social. But I would go over the ocean and mountain for my own folks. Marriage will have to feel like that to produce a real contentment, not just a ring, a wedding, sharing a companion. People seem to abuse a great deal of purpose to be married, it's just for their convenience. Hell, not for me.

Why do people get married? Why is marriage important?
While growing up, I’ve always wondered what marriage meant. I would ask every older person around about it and they would come up with the variety of explanations. Some of them would intrigue me, some would bewilder me. After having gathered a lot of theories, what hit upon me was one fact, “the beautiful coming together of two unfamiliar souls”.Really, it was one line of reasoning that was a common factor in all the theories.Now that I’ve grown up and read a lot, I’ve discovered that marriage is so much broader than this. It is an institution where two people come together, form and extend a family. It may not always be a fairytale, but the couple must make things work with love and effort. The whole thing is about commitment. How the two want to stay with each other, even when things are tough. It’s not easy and takes up all the patience but it’s worth putting all the effort.Now you might wonder why people want to get married. Well here you’d find your reasons.Companionship:One big reason why people get married is because they seek somebody to spend their life with. When one spends their life with someone, then the relationship may get emotional and a loving one. When life gets tough and things aren’t going well, people generally look for partners who can support them. Marriage offers that kind of facility to stick with one another and share the lifeAlthough it is advised to make a careful decision when choosing a partner as the partners tend to influence each other.Financial Reason:With the rising economy and expenditures, couples who stay together, find it relatively easier to carry the finances out. Financial security, helping each other out with medical bills along with other insurance makes marriage a good decision. Also, there are inheritances and retirement benefits that couple may enjoy in the later years.Legal Reasons:As we all know, the society sees marriage as something divine and legal; as a result, married couples receive numerous benefits. In our society, it’s a lot easier for couples who are married to get an apartment or get parental rights. So of course, marriage does have benefits for the couples.Better Parenting:Married couples find it easier to raise a child. When a baby is born, from the first day it becomes a huge responsibility for any couple to pay attention to the baby. Tending the kid does not stop at the infant stage. It goes on at the schooling, college, basically every stage. So, when this massive chore is divided between the couples, kids are systematically raised.Live With Love:As the elders say, “love never fails”. When a married couple chooses to live together, they vow to protect, love and stand by each other’s rough moments together. This one big reason tells us why is marriage important for mankind. Life can be much better enjoyed with love over anything else.Grow Together:When a couple spends a long time together, they mature and grow together. Marriage is an institution where people come together and experience a union where they love, laugh, and live together. Somewhere in between this process, individuals mature and explore themselves. Marriage keeps both the parties together.Stable Homes:Marriage, as it keeps two people together, it also makes a house a home. The couples not only carry out everyday chores, they also stand by each other at hard times and become each other’s emotional support. That makes a home a happy place and marriage makes that happen.Learning From Each Other:Since marriages keep two people together, it facilitates two people to learn from each other. Every individual is different and they all have something to offer. When two people spend time with each other, they are bound to pick something from one another. Marriage brings out the hidden potential in each person.Taking The Generation Forward:When a couple gets married, they contemplate bearing children. If and when they do bring a child into the world, it’s a way of taking the generation forward. As the child grows up and gets married, the generation continues onward. Therefore, marriage helps make this possible.So marriage is something that may not always be romantic, but with the effort, love, and respect for each other, it’s a beautiful thing to experience.

Why do people get married? Is there any 'story' behind the marriage?
People get married for many reasons.  For love, for money, for convenience, for safety, for residency in a county.In most Western societies, people get married for Love and the desire to build a life together.  What is marriage?  It is a commitment that you want to be with the other person for the rest of your life.  It would be pretty surprising if anyone in Western societies was unaware of the divorce rate at the moment.  They still get married.I've been married 24 years.  I remember being that young girl that was so in love and delighted to be asked to get married.  I remember the engagement and the ceremony.  I remember the picture of my dad jumping up and clicking his heels that the photographer caught when someone asked how he felt.We married because we were in love.  My husband's parents were divorced when he was young.  My parents were still together.  Other people didn't matter to us.  We did.  Together, we could rule the world.  He was, and is my best friend.  He makes me laugh and we can talk about anything.  To stay together, we had to make choices.  We were at a point in our lives where one or both of us was going to have to move.  We wanted to stay together.  We wanted children together.  We want the legal protection and ease that comes from not trying to spend your life together financially and with children that is much more difficult without being married.  We combined our lives in every possible way.Yes, relationships are hard at times.  I do not know one long term married couple that hasn't had trouble, and most committed to counseling at least for awhile.  We did for a year.  Everything changes and some problems become harder to solve.What is life like without a partner?  Even if you are together, but not married it would be harder.  What happens when one of you grow older or get sick?  Will you still be there, or when times get a bit hard will you separate?  There are always times when something happens to one person that are easier to support by a married partner.  My appendix ruptured at a time when I was unemployed, but his health insurance that covered me was superior.  He lost a job when I had one.Together (and married) we are happy, committed to each other, solving problems and willing to continue to face whatever the world can throw at us.  To me, I wonder why people don't get married.
Why do people bother getting married?
Thanks for the A2A.In America the divorce rates have reached nearly 50%,(Divorce in the United States). So your questions is pretty good, why do people bother getting married if there is a near 1 in 2 chance of splitting up? Isn't it costly and emotionally draining?Unfortunately divorce is just the result, and not the reason why people get married. There are many reason to get married: the most obvious one is romantic love. Other reasons range from: money, financial stability, arranged marriages, contractual marriages, power elevation, status/social  elevation, loneliness, societal pressure etcThose are the reasons, and in essence why people decide to get married. Some people want a partner to adventure together, some people want to  have a lot of money, some people want someone to love or complete them, and some are forced into marriages because their parents made them. So whether or not the attrition rate makes sense to get married, people get married because of the end goal or desire they want. And they believe that getting married can help them attain that goal.

Why is marriage is so essential in life, it is just part of life but it is not everything in life?
Originally marriage was a protection of property rights, so that a bastard could not sue for inheritance. Only legitimate children could inherit. Adultery laws made sure that the wife would not cuckold the husband by bearing another man's children. There were severe punishments for adultery.Remember, there was no birth control back then.More recently, the justification for marriage was that it is the most stable arrangement for raising children. Also, that it establishes protection for single parents and children in case of divorce. Still more recently, it has come to be used as a way of expressing love and devotion between two adults. The gay community had seized on this. But I find this justification for marriage completely bogus and absurd. There are lots of ways to express love and devotion without making a legal compact with the state. In my perhaps jaundiced opinion,  if you are going to have children,  marriage helps protect their futures. If you're not going to have children,  there is absolutely no need for it.

I'm among one of many people, I don't know about others but I can say why I will marry. I'm writing this because many answers lacks  basic things such as:To fit in When you see your siblings, cousins, best friends and coworkers  getting married and you they started getting busy in their lives, it is pretty lonely. Attending parties/occasions with couples is way too different. Priorities are different. Even topic of discussion will be different. Feeling of left out is  pretty boring.Romance and Sex.We all have physical needs and desires. What the point of not enjoy simple pleasures of life. We seek novelty and wanted to try new things with someone we fancy.  Pass on to children  I'll not surly earn if I have to live life of a bachelor. I will be become a monk or something like that in exotic place. I always wonder why in movies people when getting killed by a goon say" please leave me I children and wife to take care of". Their life become important because of other people lives dependent on them.What the point of earning so much or having a house when you no one to take care for.People work really hard to keep up with their socio-economic status. Of course a bachelor would not give a darn about it. Society and government treat   married people nicely unlike unmarried. Network Earlier marriage used to be more of a financial arrangements rather than romantic. Where one king married to a women from another aristocratic family or another kings daughter to have stronger political and financial benefits. Now days also families see marriage as a tie between two families rather than two individuals thats why people tend to marry in their same socio-economic status to get social security. Families help each other in adverse times and celebrate happiness together.
Please read with utmost care. Piles of emotions are involved.Aunt and Uncle were having a rough time.He was into betting and lost bigtime. Business was shut. Jewellery was mortgaged to pay his debts. He was a homie now.She was devastated, angry, and furious. Her parents wanted to take her away but she denied. She worked part-time.I am close to her. I heard all her rants. Once, in between, I asked, “You feel suffocated and unhappy. Why don’t you leave him?”She said, “You know Vasu, I got married at young-age to him. In early days of our marriage, I wasn’t able to settle in his family. I was disturbed and emotionally stressed. I doubted my decision of getting married. One of these days, I left home in the morning and travelled to a different city. Nobody knew where I was. In that span of six hours, he called me over hundred times and turned all stones to find me. When I picked up his call, the first thing I asked, Why don’t you leave me? I know I don’t keep you happy.”I’ll answer you the same that she answered me. “He said, When we got married, in between those 7 vows, I took a vow to be with you no matter what life brings in. This one-line was enough to get it all sorted. He never told anyone about this.”The moment I heard her, it all felt different, while I always believed relationships are all about love, it wasn’t, there was much more to it. Lows, frustrations, adversity, diversity, fights, these all are a part of it. While love connected them, marriage held them intact in thinnest times of their relation.It’s been over a year we had that conversation. While marriage helped them through the thinnest, it has all vanished, like it never happened. Everything seems so sorted. They are happy.I cannot do justice with the importance of marriage in mere five hundred words but yes, it gives courage to sail relationships through thinnests to thickest, turn blacks and whites to colourful, bloom a dull and dark soul and make people stick to brittle love residing in the hues of ductilility in relationships, and maybe some extra passes to re-understand what fights are worth fighting for. (Read bold again. Slowly)At times, we give up on relationships at a premature phase owing to the differences, marriage resists it.
Why do people get married?
Here is the Politically Correct answer and the Cynical (but true) Answer.The Politically Correct Answer: The answer to your very important question depends on many factors, not the least of which is whether you are a man or a woman and what marital traditions are dictated by your culture or ethnic background.In some countries, such as India, Pakistan and Japan arranged marriages are still practiced, though many young people are opting for freedom of choice, even if it means disappointing their parents.In the “Western World”, such as Europe and the United States, parental and societal expectation still play a major role in why people marry. Families with many extended relatives place a high value on children and bringing new life into the world.The Cynical (and true) AnswerBeyond societal pressures and expectations, each gender has their own “hardwired” reasoning for why marriage might be a good idea.Men -“I really enjoyed when my mother cooked for me and now that I’m on my own, I’m eating lots of T.V. dinners and spending way too much money on going out. It might be nice to have a woman around to cook and clean, so I don’t have to”.“Dating is time consuming and expensive and then getting the women to put out after I’ve bought dinner is like pulling teeth. I’m tired of trying to get my sexual needs met through SnapChat, Match and Facebook, I need to find a wife who enjoys pleasing me and desires to be pleased in return”.Women -“I don’t want to be slaving away at some low paying job the rest of my life. I need to find a man with a six figure income so I can travel, buy jewelry, get mani / pedi every week, fill my closet with cute clothes and build my shoe and purse collection”.“Ever since I was a little girl I’ve wanted a baby. I have it all planned out, I want at least one boy and one girl and not more than 2 years apart. I would just love to give them a bath, dress them up in cute outfits and go to Mommy camps. That would be so much fun! But I need a man to make a baby with and to bring in enough money so I can hang out with my kids and watch them grow”Yes, this is a bit of a cynical look at people’s motivations to tie the knot, but from my experience, not too far off the mark.Men want someone to take care of their creature comforts and women want to raise a family and be provided for.I was certainly a stereotypical man when I first got married. I had no idea how much different marriage would be from dating. I just imagined getting sex all the time, eating home cooked food and having a great life.But what I got was many nights sleeping in the “dog house”, cold left overs and person who went from loving me to hating me in less than a year and I don’t even know what I did wrong.You would think I would have had enough by then, but within a year after my divorce, I was getting married again. This time for very different reasons. I was diagnosed with a life threatening illness and thought I wouldn’t last the year. I met a lovely woman who had two kids. They were struggling to make ends meet and I decided before I died, maybe I could at least experience being a daddy.I soon found out that being a daddy and being a step-dad are not the same thing.The kids don’t see you as their father, they don’t respect you and they don’t listen to you. Basically, they hate you for trying to replace their daddy and driving a wedge between them and their mother. As it turned out, I survived the health crisis, the little family experiment failed miserably and we eventually went our separate ways.The 3rd and final marriage was one of those “midlife crisis” things. To sum it up, she was 16 years younger than me and before long, she left me for the gardner. Go figure!Now, I have a wonderful lady in my life. She is everything I have come to appreciate in a woman and a person. She’s beautiful, loves to cook for me and treats me like a king.I’ll be damned if I’m going to f*** it up by getting married!-ShaneThe Happiness Tree
Why do people want a marriage?
I have always wanted to get married because I crave the total security and trust of a marriage. Of course, that approach includes a good dose of idealism, but I'd rather be idealistic than assume I'll get divorced or cheated on.For the purposes of this answer I'll consider marriage a permanent arrangement (aka the possibility of divorce does not factor into my answers)Other than that, there are a lot of things about marriage that are attractive:1) Financially, it makes more sense to pool your income and share expenses with another person. You can do this with a partner that you aren't married to, but it gets messy to separate your finances when the relationship is over.2) It's good to have someone else that you can always depend on for support in both daily life and in the bigger picture. We all need help in life, and a spouse is the only person who you can not only depend on, but is also supposed to be working towards the same goals as you are.3) Raising children alone is difficult and proven not to be very healthy for the children. I want to have children, so I want to get married so that I can give my children every advantage possible. I also know that it's not good for them to be parented by just me. I'm a very detail-oriented, responsible person, so I know I'm going to be a good mom, but I also know that I'm not the type to run around and play or rough-house with children. I look forward to raising children with my current bf because I know he will fill in the areas of parenting that I'm not as good at.4) I would be incredibly lonely if I didn't get married. Maybe other people are fine with going home to an empty house or just getting their social support from friends and family, but that's just not me. I need to have a best friend who's there for me every single day. I need someone that I trust and like to do things with. I enjoy so many things much more when my bf does them with me.5) Personal growth: marriage is the closest relationship you can have with another human being. It's a safe place to make mistakes and learn how you can become a better person. It's difficult to live with another person day in and day out for decades, and learning to compromise and love them despite their flaws is an opportunity for you to grow into a better person. When you get divorced or when you move from one monogamous relationship to another, you don't get these same benefits, because you are essentially giving up when compromising and dealing with each other's faults gets too difficult.6) Planning for retirement: not financially, but emotionally. When I'm old and senile and ugly, I want to be with someone who has loved me since I was young and beautiful and coherent.

What is it like to live alone?
Living alone can be hell or heaven depending on your personality type. For me, it was a step ahead of heaven.Last year, I lived alone for 3 months and this was in a foreign country in a 5 bedroom house. I locked up all rooms except mine. All I used was my room, a bathroom and a kitchen.Why it was easy:I could cook whatever I wanted, well not whatever but however I wanted it. I like the extra spice and extra detailing to the cooking. Weekends were dedicated to cooking and groceries.I bought a bike and it served me well for the grocery shopping. When I went grocery shopping alone for the first time in my life, I picked just processed, preserved, unhealthy stuff. My mom almost had a panic attack when she saw a picture of my glorious shopping. I gradually moved to the fruits, vegetables and natural foods section and I eradicated the possibility of unconsciously killing myself.Also, with the bike, I explored a minimum of five temples, two buddhist monasteries and two libraries. Only with a bike and a bus pass! It’s so easy to go wherever you want when no one is rolling their eyes every time you want to go to the temple or the library.Not caring a damn about what I’m wearing. I could wear an ancient yet favorite T-shirt from the days of the Indus valley civilization or I could wear a snug, personally faded, torn jeans pant and nobody would bat an eye.Talking of clothes, I never retrieved clothes from the dryer to fold them and put them into the closet, I never even used the laundry basket to put used clothes. This is how it was for three months - put in dirty clothes into the washer, wait till it is filled with dirty clothes, wash, transfer all clothes to dryer, pick one cloth everyday from the dryer and wear it. Once all clothes in the dryer are finished, repeat. Ah! sweet life.Sing. You have no idea how nice it is to sing for yourself. Any song…any damn song and anywhere in the house. I sang in the shower, I sang while I cooked, I sang while I got ready…you name it. I belted innumerable songs! I shuffled, mixed and remixed better than most music players ;)Bye bye headphones. When you’re the only person in the house, why use the headphones? I played songs, audio books and movies in full volume…nobody to complain.What was tough at first but then became easy:Cooking was definitely tough at first but then it soon became an art and I enjoyed doing it.There is a glass door to one of the rooms. Every time I walked by it, my reflection moved along with me and for 3.635 milli seconds, before I knew that it’s my own reflection, I freaked out; I froze the first time! This happened for almost a week and then my system learnt that it’s alright.Horror movies were a complete no no during the first two-three weeks. They were totally fine after some time. I watched Conjuring, Black Water and Paranormal activity at night and slept like a baby.My schedule:Wake up at 5:30 AM. Take a bath and play Vishnu Sahasranama (Sanskrit Shloka) and other daily shlokas and mantras right after getting out of the bathroom.Eat a fruit/vegetable and make some easy breakfast and pack light snacks.Leave home at 6:30 AM to attend a 7:30 AM class. Bike till the bus stop and get into the bus.12:30 PM the class done. Get into a bus back home.There was an Indian restaurant near the place where I locked my bike. I used to buy some sambar/rasam/dal if I didn’t feel like cooking that day.Bike back home and eat lunch.Rest/write/watch a movie/read a book/solve a jigsaw puzzle till 3:00 PM.Study till 6:00 PM.Head to the park for a jog/bike/do yoga till 7:30 PM.Make dinner or just finish up what was done for lunch. Eat at 8:00 PMRead something while dozing off by 10:00–10:30 PM.Repeat.Like I said, special dishes, special destinations and special activities like meditation classes and retreats were dedicated to weekends.My accomplishments in three months of peaceful solitude:Read 11 books - reread Krishna: The Man and His Philosophy, A Scientist’s Search for Truth, reread Angels and Demons, reread Lost Symbol, reread Deception Point, Eat Pray Love, Briefer History of Time, The Hidden Reality, Take it Easy, Anatomy and Physiology for Nurses and 3 mistakes of my life. I still regret reading the last one.Practised music - my mom loves me a bit more for this one :DLearnt cooking while learning the difference between two types of yellow grams - toor dal and chana dal. Don’t judge me. See it for yourself, it is tough to differentiate!Understood that I consume normal amounts of salt and cooking oil. Since I lived alone, I knew exactly how much salt and cooking oil I consumed in a day. Mom and dad were happy about my diet. Mind you, my dad is a Yoga professor, it is tough to satisfy him!Solved a 2000 piece (first pic) and a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle.Cinque Terre, Italy painting - Buffalo Games:Starry Night, Vincent Van Gogh - EuroGraphics:Would I do this being-alone thing again? Hell yeah, without a doubt!I loved my company. I was alone but I wasn’t lonely even for a single moment. There was not one moment of boredom, remorse or conflict. I was in love and I did not need anyone to love. It’s ok if you don’t get it now. You’ll get it when you have my mental maturity ;)Remember, if you cannot live with yourself, you cannot live with anyone else. The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it is not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of the other person—without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other.- Osho
What does it feel like to live completely alone?
What is it like to live alone for the first time in your life?
Can living alone ever be joyous?
Is it wise to live alone?
Do you prefer to live alone? Why or why not?
I have been living alone since 2006. It’s a long period. Although, there were times when for few weeks, I was with others and then again alone and it continued. But at the most, I have been alone. Made all decisions alone. Gone through everything alone.Therefore, I can give an insight to how is it like to live alone.I will share my current routine and then give my conclusions to which many of you may disagree.Here we go,I get up at 5 or 6 depending on either it’s summer or winter time.I do worship to Almighty. (For some of you maybe it’s surprising but Yes, I really do)I go for a short morning walk.I prepare my breakfast at 8 or maybe even late.My office is 300m away from my home. I, don’t go to office everyday. My employees are working there according to their timetables. There are cameras installed everywhere and I can view almost every activity on my laptop or mobile. If I have to attend important meeting or discuss some issues with employees, I do visit my office for few hours. But most of the time, I monitor them from home. This gives me more time alone.I cook my lunch at 13–00 or maybe at 14–00. Since, I live alone, I am free to choose whatever I like.If I need to go for some shopping or groceries, I usually do it after lunch.I go to gym in the evening, sometimes I don’t go to gym. I may also go for swimming. Sometimes I go for a walk. The park is 100m away from home. No big deal.After workout, I prepare my dinner. Sometimes, I invite my friends over and gossip in the weekend. Sometimes, I go out with them.Sometimes I watch movie alone. If its a good comedy e-g: Ruby and Quentin, I do laugh a lot. I like it.What else? If I feel sleepy, I go to bed early. If not, I stay online and do my stuff.Sometimes, I even don’t speak to anybody for the whole day. (But recently, I got into a relationship and I’m losing my privacy and free time. Let’s see, how it goes this time.)Below is the graphic version of how I live alone:I can cook whatever I like and I can wear whatever I want.That’s now, I’m writing my answer on Quora:You have now enough idea, how it is like to live alone for some people.I would now like to mention the advantages of living alone (or loneliness), which I personally observed.I think each of us sometimes just need to be alone.1- Loneliness purifies our consciousness. During the day, we receive a lot of different information from the media, friends, colleagues and loved ones. We don’t notice how it starts to negatively affect our life. Therefore, sometimes you just need to think about everything in a quiet and peaceful place, where no one will disturb you.2. Creativity also needs silence and tranquility. When we are alone and do not specifically think about anything, our imagination gets freedom and this moment is capable of giving birth to truly beautiful ideas.3. Loneliness helps to strengthen confidence in something. We listen to our inner voice, we weigh the pros and cons on the basis of our own experience, and this is much more important than the opinions of others.4. We become more independent. When we are left alone, we can dream and create goals based on our dreams, which allow us to develop and grow independently.5. Loneliness aggravates perception. Away from the emotions and experiences of the outside world, it is much easier to draw the right conclusions or to take another look at the problem.6. It is necessary to be a little alone to reduce stress and anxiety. This helps to bring thoughts back to normal after a busy day.7. The best way to get to know yourself is to take a short break from communication with others. It will help to find what is really important to us, and set priorities.8. The best way to increase productivity is to be alone to clarify your thoughts, to put your dreams in order and put everything in order. Make strategies to achieve your targets.9- . Loneliness strengthens relationships. Believe it or not, our close people do not need our constant attention. When we have time to understand and appreciate ourselves, we are able to better understand and appreciate others.The list goes on… But I would better stop here.All the best.Edit:Inbox and comment section is so curious of who clicked these pics.- I have mentioned that recently I got into a relationship … Her classes were off yesterday and she came here to have a lunch together. So, she clicked these pictures.

8 months ago, I hit rock bottom. Life seemed unfair. I battled sadness and depression for 4 months. And I reached the ‘Fuck-this!-I’m-out’ moment and chose isolation.I quit my job. I came back home. I changed my phone number. And I cut off every possible acquaintance of mine. In few weeks, I moved out of my home and started living alone.Alone in its truest sense. No friends. No connections. No social media. As a matter of fact, most of my friends have no idea what happened to me.I was on Instagram. I was addicted to endless stalking of what my friends did over the weekend.One day, I had realisations[1]. I quit Instagram. I deactivated it. I haven’t gone back until now. I didn’t use WhatsApp too. I was hurt. And I wanted to deal with it alone.But boredom was my biggest enemy. I had to find alternatives to kill my spare time. I remembered Quora. I started writing.One of my anonymous answers went insanely viral. And suddenly people were appreciating my writing skills. Strangers over the internet were kind enough to spare their time to listen to what I had to say.That was kinder than most of the people in my life. I was and still am thankful for their generosity. I have been writing ever since. Writing is my escape now.Outcome 1: Started writing consistently. Developed hobby #1.I never even learnt to make coffee because I was scared my mom would make me prepare coffee every time for her.Now when I started to live alone, I started cooking. The first day, I called up my mom and she told me the recipe over the phone. I cooked. It was the most delicious sambar I ever had.I haven’t stopped cooking until now. I am passionate about it now.Outcome 2: Found out cooking can be fun. Developed hobby #2.Quora was not the only platform that I use to kill my boredom. I started using Reddit, Tumblr, Medium, Pinterest, Duolingo, Curiosity, The Guardian, Quizup, TED talks and I started reading articles over Pocket.As you notice, all of these platforms aren’t the primary choices of my friends. So, no one will find me here.If I am wasting my time endlessly scrolling through my phone screen then why not gain some knowledge and be productive, right?Every app that I said above builds my character and my personality.I don’t have to look at the food my friends ate last night or the pubs they danced this evening.Outcome 3: I am spending time productively by reading. Developed hobby #3.I started doing Yoga. My mind was a mess. And Yoga saved me. I got addicted to it because the peacefulness that I experience after doing it was priceless.Pro tip: If someone is going through depression, please start doing Yoga. Take a class in Udemy and just start it right away. You will find peace.Outcome 4: I do Yoga. Developed hobby #4. (Hobby because I do it for the joy of doing it and I can kill two hours every day.)After I isolated myself I have met strangers over the internet (Quora). Some have inspired me in the ways even they couldn't even imagine. I’m ever thankful to them.There is joy when you know a stranger gives you time, reads your content and appreciates you. I don’t know any of these strangers completely. In fact, I don’t know them at all. I don’t wanna know either.Strangers with good intentions feel a lot closer than friends who treat you like shit. This has been my motto. And hence the isolation.I am a Ghost now. Not many know what happened to me. I just hope everybody stays ignorant of Quora and never find me here.I talked about the positive side of my isolation. There is a dark side too.Sometimes I feel lonely. I feel like talking to someone about it. And I realise there’s none. At that moment, the feeling is the worst. Those nights, I have cried. I have had sleepless nights, not understanding why me? There is a war going on in my mind about my personality. It might end up affecting me psychologically.I’m doing better now. I am getting used to being alone because I chose this isolation. I have explored myself and my life is better than before. But there is a void. The void created by the people I cared a lot.If you are taking someone for granted in life, then don’t! Karma is a bitch and it will come right back at you.If you are being taken for granted then don’t be in that toxic relationship. Leave. You will suffer. You will be depressed. But the other person doesn’t deserve the time and effort you put into sustaining that relationship.Never leave your self-respect.–HXFootnotes[1] The worth by Raghavendra V on The Hunting Story!
I got married in December 2016 and moved to states with my husband. I was in US for 1.5 years and life was going pretty well until one fine day I realised that I can’t let my career suffer for the sake of living in America. I was on H4 visa (dependent) in which spouse is not allowed to work.So, the career oriented and independent woman soul in me woke up one day & took the charge. After having my husband’s consent I decided to move back to India alone for a while till we get a clear picture about trump moods and green card of course.My sleepless nights started with searching job on linked in & Naukri, because of huge time difference I had to stay up till late night to attend VC interviews. I didn’t want to miss any opportunity as I had a career gap of 1.5 years.By God's grace I got myself a job within 15 days of my stay in India (excluding my late night VC interviews in US). Now the real challenge was waiting ahead, of setting everything from scratch all over again.Earlier my husband was a helping hand in US. But here I was all alone managing everything from searching a house for rent, find a domestic help, buying household stuff, furniture, I had to do all alone.I had moved to Bangalore and rented a flat in BTM, where you only get independent buildings with no lift. My flat is on 4th floor and you can imagine how would it be without lift. I have to climb the stairs 3–4 times a day sometimes, because from throwing trash, buying grocery & going for work all requires me to step out of my house.Few months went by until I got settled, another trauma was waiting for me. After few months I caught my maid stealing money from my wallet so my last resort of some help in household work is also gone. Now like a wonder woman I am working, cleaning dishes, mopping the floor and cook for my self. Yes I know I don’t need gym after that.Life is tough sometimes once you start living alone especially after marriage but living alone independently has its own perks.I have decorated my house as per my whims & fancies with lots of pictures of our memories together.I have the whole bed to myself.I get lot of gifts from my husband time to time just to bring smile on my face after so much hard work I do.I can call my friends anytime for night out.I can wear anything I want, there is no one to judge me. I get enough ME time to do some self introspection.I can cook any random dishes.I had almost forgotten how its like to live alone. I have become more independent. I have started saving money again and done some investments. Living alone has given me a different perspective of life. I have become more cautious and mature.And most importantly, I know his importance in my life now. Its been more than a year we are living away carrying on with our jobs in different countries and hoping to live together again very soon.

I lived alone for 1 year in a studio flat at Koramangala, Bangalore. It was on the fourth floor. With no lift.I used to live in so much peace. I had lived in a hostel before that with 2 roommates and a shared toilet. I have lived through “Hair clogging the drain", “thats my table, dont keep your books on mine", or “I can't sleep without the fan sound, even if it is freezing cold" situations. So it was a big relief for me.But I was 22 at the time I took that decision. The flat was affordable, just 6.5K a month. Thats the price of a 3-sharing PG. So I moved in the flat. Even though I had to climb till the fourth floor, I did.It was very peaceful. A dream house I must say. I had all the time in the world to stay quiet and stare into the sky. The roof was right outside my door, a pretty chilled place to hangout. I could keep the room tidy my way. I could mess it up my way.I bought an induction cooker for preparing food. The water was free. I applied for TV cable. The landlords had given me a TV, an RO filter and a bed with it. Nice people.…Cut to 6 months. I was severely ill.I was staying alone. My parents, friends, well wishers kept calling me and telling me to visit a doctor. I wasn't strong enough to get out of bed. And when I did, I imagined going down the four floors, visiting the doctor who is just by the block, and then return, just to climb the four floors again!I fell back on the bed.My landlady, thankfully, paid a friendly visit. She saw my situations and brought me food and medicines immediately.…Eight months.Company wasn’t paying me enough to manage my expenses. Nor was I getting time to cook food at night. All my money goes in restaurants. I stop paying the TV bills.…10 months.I am unable to take care of the room alone. I can't afford a maid servant who could clean the room. And my health detoriates due to job pressure. I soon begin to regret my decision of staying alone.…12 months.My room looks nasty. I look like a mental patient. I decide to clean the room, and spend three days washing and dusting. I fall sick again. No one to take me to the hospital.My landlords have a relative come from Delhi for higher studies. They politely ask me to move out.I happily move out, find a PG where there's wi-fi, TV, electricity, food etc bills covered in the same 6.5K rent. Only compromise: back to the “drain's clogged”, “my bed”, “don't switch off the fan” drama.But, the same roommates took me to the hospital when I caught Dengue. They even paid my first hospital bill without letting me know. They would visit me twice a day and bring me fruits and juices and soups.At times you need people. You can live alone, yes. But only to an extent. In the longer run its someone you need to look after your little needs. Someone who could bring you a glass of water when you are ill. Someone who could take care of the house once in a while. Someone who could laugh at your jokes, or give you a shoulder to cry. Someone who could share your dinner table and discuss the fun things they did.Yes. We all need someone sometimes.And whats the price?To let go of those little annoying things that bother you. Of course that doesn't apply to totally uncompromising narcissistic bigots, but most people you meet in life will be nice.
What it is like to live alone?
Answering to my own question.What it is like to live alone?Almost one year back in November. I shifted to Gurgaon and as I always enjoyed my own company.I thought of living alone.Flashback:I had pretty cool life in Mumbai. Amazing roommates and those same guys as colleagues.God was making up for my dull and introvert college life.We, being roommates enjoyed a lot. I know it’s fad to call brothers to your friends but we were brothers.I had some amazing colleagues besides these two stupidos (roommates). I loved being there. Loved my work and my after-work-life.Although I always wanted to live alone and walk naked sipping coffee. I wanted to do this but leaving this amazing thing going on wasn’t easy and couldn’t have done it if I wasn’t shifting to whole new city. I made it solid for myself that I need to do this.A decision:So when in Nov’15 when I came here I started living alone.Even after living a week I wasn’t sure about this decision.I didn’t find any sense in walking naked in the room. Days were like doubled their times.I started getting confused about my decision so I put this question on Quora and within 2–3 days I got some really amazing answers.Few of them are,Charu Pathni's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Charu PathniJason T Widjaja's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Jason T WidjajaQuora User's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Quora UserDushka Zapata's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Dushka Zapata (Btw I love your answers)Sachin R Kamath's answer to What is it like to live alone? by Sachin R KamathSo after these and few more answers I started loving the idea of living alone.Thank you guys :)Here are few things I tried out:Walking Naked: Definitely walking naked in the room tops the list. It’s the sign of liberty and Hell I loved it.Dancing: Ohh dancing! I tried it I danced like crazy I know no-one is watching me. What a booster.Cleanliness: I have cleaned whenever I wanted and other days I was sleeping with lunch boxes from restaurants.Listening music: I love listening to music and and type of music totally depends on the moment I’m in. Hell! I never experienced so soothing music before. Volume up and stand in the balcony and let the lyrics pour in your mind with the wind.Silence is deep: I started enjoying silence. It is addictive. It is amazing.Never misplace anything: Ohh ohh! You will find everything wherever you you’ll leave it. Nothing ever will loose anything (mostly).I read: I have Kindle now and I read more than ever. This helped me.Everything you purchase will be used and ruined by only you, no one else.Honeymoon for your tongue: I bring the food I love. I order whenever I feel like hungry. Discussing what to order is not an over-head anymore.Unlimited sleep hours without disturbance: You sleep anywhere you want. You can sleep on floor or on the bed or even in the balcony and nobody will interrupt for anything. On weekends I sleep for hours in days and night. I read when I wake up and then sleep again.Living alone and lonely is totally different.I can study more than I used to. Nobody ever makes fun of that. Nobody calls you geeky or less cooler because of it.Cooking: I tried Cooking, it didn’t work out but I can whenever I want and I’m not afraid of that. Except roti, I couldn’t do it yet.Overthinking: It is not a problem anymore because I’m friend with it. It doesn’t bother me anymore. I’ve learned to let go thoughts.You need nobody: In the end of the day, you don’t need anyone to complete your day.You can bring anybody home: Yes, and no-one will know. Ever! No-one will gossip about it.F.R.I.E.N.D.S: Watch friends on speaker all the time and nobody looses their mind about it.Whole bed is yours you can sleep either side of it. You own whole bed :DTalk to myself: This might seem filmy but I do this and it is one thing that everyone should do. Try to say what you are thinking. Give words to your thoughts and they will be stronger than ever.Love for family: I have started loving my family more than ever. I don’t know how!In short, I’m king of my own little planet whose anthem music is:Cons to living alone: But very few:I surely miss being with Mumbai friends. But I’m sure I would have missed them anyway.I don’t wanna live with anyone anymore. I’m even afraid to get married. I’m afraid how I’ll adjust with her.I want to run back to my little planet if I’m with people for long.But you can see pros outcast cons.One should definitely try once in the lifetime. But beware it is addictive.Thank you for putting the idea of writing an answer to my own question Anangsha Alammyan (Quite tough name to pronounce though). Loved it. Thank you :)
It’s magic!I stay alone for the past 3.5 years. With utmost certainty I can tell you that living on your own is magic. It teaches you responsibility, discipline, importance of freedom and sooo many other things! Sounds like I’m faffing? Let me break it down for you.Independence- You’re on your own. There is no one to do chorus, buy that grocery, get the faulty tube light fixed, cook dinner. I have not kept any help nor do I have any friends or family staying close to my place. I am on my own. And there is no one else to depend upon except myself. There, that is what is true independence, freedom from any external outside support.Freedom- You are you without anyone’s permission. No questions asked, none answered. You don’t have the drain and pressure of having constant, tedious duties to fulfill, and you never have to walk on eggshells around other people. Nobody around needs to be taken into account, you are all you have.Long lost hobbies- You have plenty of time when you stay alone. No amount of binge watching Netflix or sleeping can keep you preoccupied always. Lesser minds would deduce that’s why staying alone is meant to be boring. NO. You re-learn. Things you had discarded earlier comes back. For instance, I had always enjoyed mithila painting. The gruelling 5 year law course and an equally hectic professional life, made me forget how much I enjoyed doing it. These 3 years have brought it all back. True it took my months to turn the painting contemplation into an actual painting! But I did finally. Look at this:I wouldn't have ever reverted to painting unless I had the experience of living alone and thinking about what I wanted to do truly.New things- Re-learning suppressed hobbies aside, you actually put thought in new things. Why can’t this happen when NOT living alone you ask? Of course it can, but on your own, you constantly try to do things. Why? To do different things, try your hand at stuff you haven’t done before. For me, I learnt cooking! I knew how to cook a normal daal-chawal and survive on myself. But I actually wanted to cook good new food. Sample one of my finest white mushroom pasta.Not bad, eh!? Truth be told, even Quora happened to me coz I wanted to try a new forum for writing.Money management- This is the real deal. You might have heard staying alone is way more expensive than sharing accommodations. I was told that many times by my parents when I was moving into my flat. Stay with someone, your rent will be divided. Ghar ka saaman bi baant k lana hoga. This may or may not be true but I do know for a fact your money management skills will improve by leaps and bounds when you stay alone. Accountability for your own hard earned money comes naturally, you see.Travel- I had always loved travel. I was lazy and always broke so never went. Until recently. My New Year resolution since two years is to at least go to TWO new places every year. Trust me, travelling changes you. It’s not just cliche, travel works.There are so many more things I can add to this list, but it’s gonna be just too long. You learn patience, appreciate people more, build confidence internally, learn to be self-sufficient.But you know, at the end of the day everything eventually boils down to how are you as a person.When you come back home to pin drop silence, everyone gets to decide for themselves if that’s akin to loneliness or freedom.
What it is like to live alone?
Staying alone is a form of art, I try to make it beautiful each day. I think I have taken the concept of  living alone to the next level. It has been a bittersweet feeling until now. My case is similar to yours, however, I stay in not a city. I recently moved to a small town called Crailsheim, in the state of Baden Württemberg, Germany. Here is a photo of a stream running through the town:Isn't it just a pretty little town? I arrived here for my internship at P&G and had already been here once before for the same interview. I had seen this place back then, and was sure I was going to have  to put up with the feeling of being lonely. I am introverted to some extent and didn't really think it was much big a deal. So, why is it so extreme for me you ask? Several reasons:I hardly know the language to start a conversation, and not many here speak English.Winter was coming, and so you better stay the fuck indoors for most of your time unless you want to turn into a Popsicle. Non-existent nightlife, because it's a very small town and you hardly see anyone out after 7 pm.You don't see many young people and the average age seems to be above 40. I saw four spectacle shops on the main street that stretches for not more than 300 m, and there is just one main street. I'm not that great at making friends and like the company of only a few people. I like to stay by myself and mind my own business.Non-existent neighbors. At least they don't seem that friendly. Fortunately, I was to find a big, cozy and fully furnished room weeks before I arrived here. I had never stayed all by myself in a room of this size and so beautiful, I just fell in love with it. It had everything you can ask for to stay comfortably, here are a couple of photos:I have not yet switched on that TV, and I ain't kidding :/This is the view right through the window of my apartment:So initial few weeks I was pretty much excited to explore the town and make some new friends at my office. I did that, and then I didn't know what to do anymore. There was nothing much to look forward to during weekends. All my colleague friends (I was the only intern student at this time of the year) would go out of the city, travel during weekends. I would end up sulking in my room. Fortunately, I had many hobbies, and for the rest of the time I had to find a new routine to work with. It has turned to more like a regiment these days.   So, my advice for you is to invest time in yourself and goes like this:Live in an apartment that you feel like going back to at the end of your day. Let it be affordable, I would say somewhere around 15% of your income. Gives you enough room and doesn't make you feel claustrophobic. Make sure it's comfortable enough for you to practice your hobbies/ job.Spend time on your hobbies or whatever you are good at. However, keep it different this time. I am good at making realistic pencil drawings and have been making them for the past 3 years now (Here is my Quora answer showing my realistic drawings: Sachin R Kamath's answer to What are some examples of your own pencil drawings?). But here I tried to make it different and do something unconventional. I spend most of my time on weekends thinking of my new art work and a way to execute it flawlessly with the limited resources I have at my disposal. Here is what I sketched recently for Walt Disney's birthday:Workout. Trust me on this one, nothing feels better! It will help you keep yourself active and efficient through the day. Gets you good sleep at night. Keeps you fit. You start feeling more confident of yourself  and people will start noticing you. It makes you disciplined. There's an instant charm to your whole body and the way you live. I hit the gym thrice a week and I try to exercise in my room if I'm not able to. And you probably guessed it right, I workout alone most of the time as well. I usually arrive at the gym after 8 pm and there is hardly anyone else there at this time. So I wasn't joking when I said I have taken the art of being alone a notch higher. Learn to cook yourself a nice meal. I hate going to restaurants and paying unnecessarily when I can myself cook. This saves me a lot of money and keeps me involved during weekends. Cooking is easy and also interesting once you start experimenting according to your tastes. It also helps you in socializing. Just cook some of your traditional cuisines and invite your friends/ colleagues over. I did that in my first month here and got to know many colleagues from my office who have been the only reason I don't feel as much lonely here. They always invite me for weekend hangouts in the pub (Yes, there is just one good pub here, at least!). Here are few of my culinary skills I learnt over the past few months:I can't go about my weekend without cooking now, and I don't have to miss my home food anymore.Travel. Don't be afraid to travel solo. I always made it a point to travel at least once every month. Just a get away for the weekend, to cities nearby. Visiting some friends or making new ones. In the past 8 months of my stay in Germany, I have traveled to 7 different countries. So just get out there and plot the contours of your life on the map of the world. Cultivate a new hobby. When you got so much time at your disposal, why not learn something new? I always liked photography, and this was the right time for me to pursue it. It fit perfectly into my schedule, since I would travel often and all I had to do was grab my camera along with me. I have taken some amazing photos during my travels and it's also a good way to keep your parents happy while they are on the other side of the planet worrying about you. One of my favorite clicks is this one from Dubrovnik in Croatia, before I took a tumble into the pristine waters of the Adraitic sea myself:In fact, I'm so alone that sometimes I take pics of myself with my DSLR camera, since I hate selfies. Buy a bike. The first thing I bought after arriving in this town was a bike    ( not even groceries). It's one of the best investments to make. You save a lot of money on public transport, get to burn your calories, and also go on long bicycle rides during weekends. I travel to office to and fro on my bike everyday, a total of 11 km. I did an impromptu bike ride of 65 km once. Passing through tiny hills and bucolic pastures, and getting lost in the woods. It was very scary, 'Wrong Turn' level scary minus the hot chicks! How I managed it is an entirely different story you can read here Sachin R Kamath's answer to What is the craziest thing you have ever done? Buy a good set of speakers. If you like listening to music while you work/ cook, then you must invest in buying some good set of speakers. Music in my room is always playing and keeps me alert and ticking. The point is to stray away from the feeling of loneliness, it works. Also, some beer after a tiring day while subtly drifting away to the tune of Floyd is a feeling to have.Read. Yeah, I know. Same old. What every other Quoran so called 'avid reader' says. But I would like you to find a spot in your town where you can sit, read, and contemplate. Be it a cafe or a park. I recently found mine across a stream, facing the skyline of  15th century imperial buildings with the Rathhaus towering over them in the background. Also, lots of ducks quacking. That was the sweet part of being alone, the fancy part. The bitter part also does prevail but you live through it and move on. Because failure is not an option. Loneliness creeps through your skin, tries to get inside you and break you, but you must stay strong. Stay focused. How do you do that? You get to the sweet part mentioned above, keeping yourself busy and exploring the new. Oh, and yeah, sometimes I drink alone too. Isolation, It ain't for the faint-hearted. It's a form of art, so make it beautiful. All the best!
If someone asks me what’s the best decision I took in my life, undoubtedly I respond with“MOVING OUT TO LIVE BY MYSELF”Disclaimer: Time duration I mentioned below might be different in someone’s life who moved out to live by himself/herself. However, I hope there will be coincidence between our cases.I totally understand you might wonder what’s big deal in that ?, so let me briefly include about my life ( trust me it’s just a small paragraph hahahah)Till my grand ma died , in 2013 May and it was my 22nd year , she used to feed me while I was at home. In 2013 August, I moved to USA , and here it was my aunt. If there is anyone whom I like as much as I like my mother, she is my aunt. Till 2016 August (means my 25th year), I lived in their home and she used to cook lot of dishes , in fact most of the times she asks me whether I like the dish she is going to cook, so that I can eat it. She is such a beautiful lady. So , just assume a guy who never cooked or lived alone till first 25 years in his life and suddenly move out.Huh, Come on man, it’s not fun.This is how I felt since I moved out :Month 1: This is awesome, living by yourself, having your own privacy , doing what you want to do , this is just perfect state of life. You try to cook various dishes, fail sometimes, but you still feel good because you are learning something new.Month 2: Sometimes, things become hectic in life, you find no time to cook , so you opt to eat out. After a week or two you realize that you are way above your spending, consequently going short of money . This is where everything starts.Month 3: You feel lonely, you come home every evening /night after your work/classes, you realize you have no one to talk. You don’t know what to do. Sometimes you text to friends , who might not respond sometimes because of their own hectic schedule. Finally, you feel lonely. Right at this point, few people give up and go back to normal life by vacating the apartment/home. But, the real benefit will be seen by those who hang in there and try to get over from it.In the book David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell called these sort of difficulties as “Desirable Difficulties”During this stage, you will learn more about you and your thinking. You will come to know what plays crucial role in your life and whether you are keeping priorities in correct order. In short, you will learn about you .Month 4 and from then:You will start working on yourself,.You get habituated to new habits.You cook at home just to maintain finances.You wake up at time and get your things done, so that you have to push yourself to start your day.You keep things prioritized right from paying bills to cleaning home every two weeks.No surprise, if your pillow becomes your best friend ( if you know what I mean )You find time for yourself.You will learn how to prioritize things in your life, especially in finances.You will realize how worst you can cook and the fun part is you have to taste it because you cannot throw it out. Come on bud, it’s our hard work we cannot throw it out. hahahahahahaPersonally, after experiencing this , I believe “LIVING BY YOURSELF” at least for an year or two should be experienced by everyone in his/her own life.The seed you sow to live by yourself, will reap with great benefits for you.Good Luck-Karthik Achanta

What is it like to get married and live alone?
Getting married can be wonderful and frightening.This is especially true if your spouse is in the military. Deployment is where your spouse is sent to another duty station. You are left behind because there usually isn’t housing available for the spouse. The frightening part is if they are in a hot zone (fighting going on) and you have to rely on the members of their unit to watch their back.You will probably need to find something to do with your time. A lot of the wives/husbands find jobs or go to school or both. You can do crafts and all sorts of things.Make your home a welcoming place.

Yes, immediately the same night. I am a well educated, good looking girl from an upper middle class society in a tier 2 city who got into an arranged marriage as love did not happen till my late twenties. The grooms family were relatives of my father’s friend , so we did not get into a proper bgc. The guy was a single child of his parents, they were well educated and well off, they showed a very liberal picture and pretended to be very affectionate. Soon after the ceremony, it was the boys birthday the next day, so I had ordered a cake (worth rs 500) in the same hotel where my wedding took place, the guys family denied to taste it or pay for it as I had not taken permission from my then mother in law. My father cleared all bills of the wedding including their stay, food , even the cake.I learnt my husband gives his entire salary to his mother and even his credit card messages go to his mothers mobile. He never paid for any of my petty expenses. Since I had entered the marriage, I wanted to be positive and not mind their stingy attitude ( I had done my MBA from XLRI and was earning well before marriage, had to quit my job to relocate with my husband and in laws), I thought I will anyway join somewhere and fulfill my own needs. I never expected any financial help from him anyway.Right after marriage to my surprise I was asked to stay in a room with a single cot and cupboard which my husband was using, so I used to sleep on the floor and live out of my bag as my in laws did not have time to do up the house. Even though I had money and I really needed proper furniture, the mother in law had to find time to approve the furniture which never happened. She used to plan the days for her son, even though I had quit my job and had planned a gap before joining the next job , I could never spend a day with my husband.My mother in law was always around my husband and would never allow us personal space as she was too possessive about him. She even cut short our already short honeymoon pretending she was unwell.Thankfully I had secured a new job within the first month of marriage in the new city. Initially I faced indirect remarks regarding them having to bear my food and recidential expenses (it was their own house, not rented) , I suggested to share the expenses but they wanted my entire salary to be transferred to my mother in law. This was the first thing I objected as I had been financially independent for 7 years and this step would have made me dependent on the mother in law even for the smallest decisions just like her son was.The household help was asked to leave and I was expected to take care of all the chores as ‘I was the woman of the house’ . But I had no rights. I had not managed these things before which was clearly communicated to them prior to marriage and they were fine with it then, but post marriage, they were constantly pointing mistakes, passed sarcastic remarks, used to taunt and sometimes humiliate in front of guests for minor mistakes in cooking/serving food etc. I used to cook dinner inspite of being tired from work and all the traveling. At times they would ask me to make some desert after dinner , at times they would keep my food aside and order in even before tasting the food saying they were not fond of the dish.The guy used to regularly check my phone, I never doubted his actions and had nothing to hide, he shared my location without my knowledge with his mother and himself. They used to question even when I spoke with my own family. They asked me to cut my roots to be able to grow new roots there. Due to the constant pressure in all directions at my in laws place it was impossible for me to maintain any contact with any of my friends, I used to immediately rush home after work, even tried Mumbai local trains to reach faster, being an outsider it’s difficult.I started getting very depressed as I failed to understand why these people were so unfair to me inspite of me trying so hard to meet their expectations. The mother and son used to hold secret meetings behind locked doors , within a family, this was strange for me. Finally they put immense pressure on me to quit my job on the pretext of not managing the household work well. I resisted as that was my only respite from the suffocating environment where you need permission from the mother in law to even breathe.My husband and his mother used to do everything together, even did not allow anyone else besides each other in car or the dining table, they were codependent partners. The only person my husband cared about was his mother, not even his father who was too old and financially dependent on his wife. They just needed a puppet for a daughter in law who would be completely dependent on them for all her needs and carry out their orders. I was not taken to a doctor even one time I was running 104 fever and left to recover naturally.All this happened within 2 months of marriage. Though I had not informed any of this to my parents as even I could not understand anything clearly and they would have been tensed. But my in laws called them to Mumbai to talk to them and pressurize me to quit my job. They expected being from a small town they would agree to anything to save the marriage. My father being very progressive and supportive immediately took me out of their house and was decided on ending such a marriage as he did not trust their intentions anymore. My in laws kept all my Jewellery, clothes, cosmetics etc but that was our least concern. They used to scheme and lie at the drop of a hat. I took few months to come out of the shock and filed for a divorce, it took 1.5 years and lot of mud fight to end a 2 month long marriage. I still face the social stigma as a divorcee but at least I breathe free air, laugh , talk , travel like before. Have my family and close friends with me. I feel fortunate to have come out of that hell so fast.Now moral of the storyPlease please please try to spend enough time, judge a person, don’t ignore alarm bells before marriage, better safe then sorry. Don’t ever give in to societal pressure because of biological clock ticking, no one really cares afterwards.Know that extremely greedy and selfish people do exist , they will never treat you as a family but as a commodity. Stay away from mamas boys , read about the mama’s Boy’s syndrome, Oedipus complex . You will be reduced to a third fiddle in your own relationship.You can not build a foundation of a relationship on manipulation, mistrust, lies, scheming, torture etc. It defeats the very purpose of a love relationship which is supposed to nurture you and help you grow as a human being.If still you get caught in an abusive relationship, run fast in the opposite direction and save your life. DO NOT linger on false hopes, people don’t change much post their 30s. Don’t worry too much about society, not more than your life and freedom to breathe.EDIT : The reason I shared all these incidents in such details is even If it helps a single girl recognize such people before getting into such an arrangement or inspires anyone come out of such an abusive relationship, I will feel much better, more than taking revenge which many of you have suggested in your comments. Question that many have asked- Reason I didn’t file for a DV(though initially I had a lot of anger) is it would have further aggravated the situation, given the Indian legal system, what took me 1.5 years because the guys side agreed for mutual consent divorce during counseling itself(I had filled for an annulment) would have taken me lot many years to prove as mental harassment cases are not easy to prove. When in a family, you don’t record conversations apprehending a divorce. After consulting a good divorce lawyer, I took a guided step. My only aim was to be free of that relationship as soon as possible- legally and mentally, plus you can’t really beat shrewd people in their own game, it is more draining for you then for them.As far as their next victim is concerned, I am sure that they won’t get the guy married as their purpose was to silence the society when it asked why they were not getting the guy marriage till a late age, that is achieved. As some of you have already guessed, the mother and the son were in an unhealthy relationship, I have bumped into situations which point to that, don’t know till what extent their partnership was, I did not mention this part earlier as I did not want to take the discussion there - it’s very difficult to know unless you stay with such people, but yes I have mentioned indicators and symptoms of knowing these before getting into it now that I know. They had even preplanned my divorce if I did not agree to their terms, reason I say it is they had insisted for the ‘special marriage act’ instead of ‘Hindu marriage act’ during marriage registration even though both were hindus(The former act restricts the alimony rights of the women only to the guy’s property not his parents- we found out later). Also now they know their other intention of getting a docile maid to slog, stay in a corner and pay for their luxuries can never be fulfilled. People may be fooled once but not for a lifetime.The other query was how to recognize a Mama's boy - while I am not an expert and there are lot many articles on the internet, some sure shot cues from my experience are 1) financial dependence 2) Can’t take decisions big or small without consulting mother 3) Mention her in almost all conversations, unusually large number of times. 4) his preferences match with hers almost in everything, again that points that he doesn’t have an independent thought process and has to please his mom compulsively 5) these families remain socially isolated and are secretive in nature. 6) Mom praises him for everything big or small, right or wrong, he needs that validation, when you show him the mirror, he doesn’t like it, shows passive aggressive behavior. Further, you can talk to a psychologist or read on the internet for more behavioral symptoms.That brings me to the next one - why I did not find out in the courtship period. I did have a courtship of about 5 months, but we were in different cities. His father had just undergone a bypass surgery before we met for the first time, so he could not travel to meet me , I travelled couple of times but never met him without his family (except for a lunch). Even phone conversations were around his fathers health and wedding preparations. Lets just say we were easy believers and had never seen such people in life, and they were good actors, so it was a easy for them to fool us.And finally the last question why did I tolerate their nonsense for that long. Well, when you have entered into a relationship commitment, you need to give it a chance, benefit of doubt, reflect on your own actions, try for improving yourself and the environment, try to communicate. I did all of this for those 2 months. When I saw all this was falling into deaf ears and I was being perceived as an idiot and a push over for putting up with everything, their expectations from me kept increasing, I took an action. We should be flexible, but know our saturation level, how far we are getting stretched and act before reaching our breaking point.Hope that answers all your questions. Many thanks for extending your love, support and good wishes. Take care.

My first marriage lasted 89 days.That’s slightly longer than a Kardashian marriage, but still not terrific.Jokes aside, it’s not that I am flippant about marriage. I waited until I was almost 30, with a guy I’d known and worked with for several years. He seemed to be a kind, successful, respectable person, and public figure within our community. I felt lucky to have snagged him. I asked him all the “right” questions, trying to uncover any possible stumbling blocks: religion, children, fighting “style”, life goals, debt levels, sexuality… you name it, we covered it.I didn’t expect that everything he told me would be a lie. Damn, I still can’t get over how good he was at lying. I’ve never encountered anything like it. But there were few to no warning signs that he was a terrible person until the week of the wedding. When people and worlds start colliding at an event like a wedding, it can become difficult to suppress the truth.The wedding day was a hot mess. Everything was a sign that I needed to run, but I was bull-headed and determined to go get my way. I didn’t pay attention.For starters, I had to buy a dress on my wedding day. Not kidding. My dressmaker failed to complete the gown I’d been fitted for in the months prior. She showed up with a half-sewn, un-pressed gown the day before. My parents scrambled to find me a time for fitting at David’s the day of my wedding. I purchased the third gown I tried on, and it was actually really lovely. That’s beside the point.As we arrived at the ceremony, things felt very strange. Our families were standing on different sides of the gallery, not speaking. I went to my room to get ready. I can’t describe it as well as I want to, but something was “off.” My father, as he walked me down the aisle, gestured toward the door and said to me, “I don’t know why I’m saying this, but I need you to know that if you want to walk away from this, if something feels wrong, I have my car pulled up and I’ll deal with the fallout.” He’d never mentioned being against my ex previously. I shrugged it off, but holy shit.So we got married. And that’s when immediately, the kind, gentle, loving man I had been engaged to became a total POS.His best friend and our best man showed up—a person he previously claimed was straight, but clearly was both gay and in love with my ex. He gave a toast that made 120+ guests cringe. It was all about how in love he is with my ex, how he’ll never forget the first time they laid eyes on each other, and how he’ll be there for him when our relationship inevitably ends. (Spoiler alert! I found out later they banged before we met. Bet you didn’t see that coming!)We danced our first dance. He didn’t like the way I was dancing, so he whispered frustrated coaching remarks in my ear the entire time.His parents, people who had until this moment embraced me with love, refused to give us a toast and sent his brother instead. It’s as though they knew what I was getting into.Later that night, I walked out in my ridiculously hot new lingere. He couldn’t perform. But he was really excited to order 10,000 calories worth of room service and pass out.My mother’s pearl earrings that she let me borrow were stolen from our hotel room that night.See? Hot mess. Of course I had the thought “what have I done!?”And it only devolved further over the next 88 days. I found out he hadn’t filed taxes in 5+ years. My bank account that I put his name on started getting routinely raided for funds by the IRS. He became verbally abusive and controlling. His many other lovers (at least SIX of whom were on the guest list to our wedding) started coming out of the woodwork. And so, so so much more than I could convey in this post. It’s humiliating…still. But, the silver lining is that it’s over. I had his things removed while he was out of town and never spoke to him directly again, despite him making threats to me through our contacts and lawyers.I am remarried with kids now, and forever grateful for the life I live today.I’m anonymous because years later, in some way, I still sort of fear him and how he might retaliate if he knew I was telling people the truth.
I did, because I wasn’t a ‘virgin’.Imagine being intimate with your husband on the first night, for the first time ever. He's constantly looking down to check something rather than in your eyes. Then sighs deeply, thrusts a couple of times to finish, and immediately runs out of the room.He did return after a couple of minutes, visibly trying hard to control his anger.Him : "You're a used disgusting woman who has spoiled my life."Me : "What?"Him : "You're not a virgin. I couldn't see any blood. You're a cheat."Me : "What the fuuuuuuuu.."That was the first conversation I had as a newly wedded girl minutes after I lost my super duper precious virginity with my 'perfect' husband, handpicked by my parents.First night, and I was made to feel first like a prostitute, then like a cheat, and finally like damaged commodity. It was like his world came crashing down. I tried to actually give him basic 10th standard level sex education. That some girls don't have hymens and sometimes it just breaks from normal physical activities. But no. For him, it was like 'seal broken, product faulty'. Too bad we don't live in a tribe where a bride's virginity is a topic of open discussion the next morning. All my poor husband could do was huff and puff and act irate. The whole family was concerned how he went from being super excited to super irate in one night. They asked me, but how could I say their ideal son was only excited about uncorking his new trophy, not be wedded & start sharing a life with a girl. This went on for 2 whole months. Not even eye contact with me for compassion, but only interaction was arguments. Actually, we did have sex once during that time. I think he just couldn't control his excitement to a female body lying vulnerably on his bed. It had nothing to do with me because he didn't look at my face or talk to me before, during or after. I had gone along with it because I thought finally my efforts are paying off and he is normal now. Too bad.I had to literally have him verify the little hymen factoid with 3 gynaecologist. One of them even scolded my husband. Not only he had no trust in a girl he was already married to and it wasn’t even about a perceived ‘lie’ about my sexual history, he actually had the attitude of a cheated commodity owner. I was so disgusted. Am I no more than an iPhone that can be jailbreaked? Even if I wasn't a virgin I would have owned up to it & still not let him objectify me! After 2 months I finally lost it & yelled at him to go hire a detective to dig up my past if he doesn't trust my word. That's when he let it go. At least in front of me, I won't be surprised if he has actually hired one. But by now the damage has been done. I now know how he perceives our intimate moments. They are not 'bonding experiences' to him as they are to me but as achievements or rewards, no matter what he says now. (Which isn't much. He just chants 'I’m sorry, give me another chance' like a whiny baby.) I has been 6 months to our marriage now.There are so many other problems, like how I can't even buy a coffee mug without my father-in-law's approval. How his mother shares such a codepedent bond with her son and just won't let go. It's like we aren't a couple, but I'm the third wheel in their relationship. It is suffocating our already damaged relationship. But if my husband can't see that, even I don't have the energy & inclination. How there is no privacy and all the women are always scouting my belongings, how they have dumped all the household chore on me since the first week like I'm an unpaid maid.Honestly, if I wasn't for the 'what will people say' phenomenon, I would have filed for a divorce. My parents keep telling me to adjust because unless he's hitting me regularly, there's no reason.Either this relationship will kill me, or I will kill it. Since the latter isn't happening, the former will.
Woah! I’m not alone. I used to wonder, why me? But then I realized that shit happens.To start with, I’m a north indian guy. My parents started looking for a prospective bride three years back. I’m reasonably built, just above average looking ( a little exaggeration) guy with typical engineeering graduation. My expectations of a bride was simple and clear, just like anybody else, I wanted an urban educated (I’ll get back on this), decent/good looking girl who shares my values. Pretty simple, isn’t it? That’s what everybody wants. Well, ideally.My parents are orthodox but I have lived with them all my life, so I took this fact very lightly. As soon as the search began, my parents went to our native for an indefinite vacation. I looked after the family business and was doing reasonably well. Now, proposals started flowing in and I rejected all of them as none were suitable. In my case, the proposals were consistent at one fact- every girl I denied, the next one was getting worse. That’s primarily because all proposals were from my native place - less educated, less decent looking, let alone sharing my values. I couldn’t get a single proposal which could at the least satisfy the first two requirements. Anyhow, I never lost hope. I was waiting for the perfect match. As a typical indian guy, I confined myself to ‘arranged’ marriage because of parental and societal pressure. No matter how much you earn, how forward thinking you are, you always fall for this trap.One day, my parents sent me a proposal on WhatsApp and the moment I recieved it, I immediately turned it down-politely. I did not have the voice to sound rude to them. Now, my parents had other plans. They said that I didn’t like it because she wrapped herself up in Sari and she was not photogenic. I told them otherwise. But they didn’t budge. They told me to get down to my native a see her in person. I denied. They played tricks on me and somehow got me down to native. Now, they told me that they have other 3–4 proposals in hand and wanted me to see them in person. I visited them and couldn’t imagine my life with anyone. I rejected all of them. When I had to return back, they told me that a meeting has already been arranged to see a girl and I don’t really have to say yes. I reluctantly agreed. And, here we are, meeting the girl I denied.Now the real twist in the story starts. I did not like the girl in person as well. But my dear ones (excluding my parents), whom I trust blindly fell blind and told me to say yes. I was shocked. I shrugged and said that we take this discussion back home. We left. After reaching home, I asked a few dear ones and they told me to accept the proposal. I fell prey to the emotions and reluctantly agreed. Immediately upon my agreement, my parents started the marriage process. They informed the bride’s parents, paid customary visits, discussed other topics etc. Marriage was fixed six months from then. I was not happy at all. I came back home and strongly disagreed, but my dear ones convinced me otherwise. I did not talk to the girl and strongly advocated against it to send them a message. The bride’s parents were ignorant about it.Months were passing by, I couldn’t believe that I was getting married. I was clearly not happy about it. In fact, I was depressed but never showed it on my face hoping for the best. I hoped that I may have been making the right move. I never informed any of my friend of my marriage. No enthusiasm. None.All wedding shopping started. All relatives gathered and I’m still hoping for the best. No sign of happiness. Atlast, the D day arrived. I wasn’t happy with any of the marriage arrangements, but who cares? It was my parent’s son’s wedding that I attending, not mine. Marriage completed. The girl arrives at my home. I can subtly felt the vibes from my neighbours, family friends, relatives. They weren’t quite excited. But who gives a fcuk?First day into marriage, after we were done with post marriage rituals, I felt there was no spark of first night in me (mind you- I’m highly sexually active). Nevertheless, I thought to myself- let’s make this work. As soon as I entered in the room, I made my first move, I held her hand and sat down. I offered her to get rid of all jewels and makeup and feel at ease. She agreed. I told her that I didn’t want to rush things up and that we get to know each other before we could get intimate. She agreed. A few more formality questions and she agreed. We slept that night - strangers to each other. Now things started to prick me- the way she spoke, the way she behaved, the way she was. Nothing wrong for her and everybody around me but everything wrong for me. Next Morning, I realized that I have made a blunder, that she is not the one I can live the next 50 years of my life, that she is not the one I’m willing to see as my child’s mother.Second day into my marriage and all the negative thoughts gush into my mind and heart. I did not want to live with her. The girl had no fault. She would make a good wife of herself, but not to me. Suddenly, I didn’t want to live in my own house. I wanted to leave.There’s a saying - If you don’t like someone in the first sight, you will never like them in the eternity. This was the issue in my case. She was not to blame. It was my fault to have entered into this marriage. She was just as blind and unaware as I was. We returned back to home. I did not speak to my parents and to that girl at first. But later I cleared the air that I have made a mistake and that this girl was not suitable life partner to me. Since then, there has always been tense moments in my home.To cut long story short, she lived with us for roughly three months and has gone to her parent’s home for a vacation. Their parents have also come to know about this situation. I have not contacted her or them and have not let them contact me. My parents believe that all these are my stars’ doing and not mine and they are living in hope that things will settle in the next year.Now, I’m stuck in this marriage and waiting to end. I have decided that no matter what, I’m not going to accept that girl as my partner and I hope that the girl understands this at the earliest.Any suggestions/advices are welcome. Criticisms are also welcome as I know that I am the one to be blamed and no one else.

My mom told me she realized on the honeymoon what a disastrous mistake she had made marrying my father. Apparently after a year and a half of being charming, loving, etc, he turned into a complete douchebag. Started (continued, probably, just not in secret) smoking pot, drinking heavily, refusing to work. She was close to his family and her own were all dead or estranged, so she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt at first. Left him once after my older brother was born but he pleaded and begged and said he would change. He didn't. By the time she had decided she wanted to leave for good, she was pregnant with me.Epilogue: Because she's tough as nails and very smart, she stuck it out until I was 13 (the age at which children of divorcing parents in Georgia can choose whom to live with), then bailed. Today she has a PhD in educational leadership and heads up a string of schools in Dubai making an extremely healthy six figures. She's my hero for every reason a mother could be and I'm so proud of her I could burst.
As many others before me have said, if something niggles at you about the person, you should listen to it.I am from India and it was an arranged marriage. When my parents discussed about marriage with me, I told them that I would go by their decision as long as the guy is able to converse in English. Though my mother tongue is Kannada, I was more comfortable in English and we spoke English at home except for my mom. Everyone in my extended family spoke in English.So when this guy came, though he knew English, he was not very comfortable with it. And everyone in my family scolded me for having such a stupid criteria.In hindsight, I should have put my foot down. Anyway, my to-be-MIL wouldnt let us meet before the wedding, which we all thought was weird. She was like talk to me, but dont talk to my son. First Flag.So after our wedding, when I first went to their house after a few days (because of other ceremonies being held at the bride’s house), my husband planned the honeymoon at that time. So during the day, he made a plan to go to Ooty. He didnt even book the bus tickets. We went to the bus stand and bought tickets to the next bus going to Ooty.I had never done that. My dad was a planner and would have planned everything months in advance. So we really didnt have much to talk to each other. But our trip was ok, not luxury but comfortable. Of course, he made me spend for the entire trip.It was only after we came back, his father scolded him for letting me spend. But he didnt regret it. He is like her father gave her the money for the trip, so I asked her to spend.Silly stuff like they wanted my dad to buy a bed because they wanted to show their neighbour what my dad could provide for his daughter. The day my husband saw our daughter for the first time (No, he was not around for her birth), he said now you can not leave me. My dad touched his feet and said he was sorry though there was nothing he said or did to insult my husband and his family.His mom was crazy. After breakfast, she would clean the whole house, all windows, doors, etc, including the garage everyday. This would literally take up the whole day and it would be 5 or 6 in the evening by the time, we were done with the cleaning. In addition, I would have to make lunch and dinner. I had no idea how, so she would scream out instructions and I would make. His sisters once asked what my dad would have done if they had asked for dowry, I said he would have refused. How I wish they had asked for it, instead of asking after the marriage. Everytime, my dad visited me, he gave me some spending money. I had no money and I was not allowed to even think of working though I was an MBA.Anyway, long story short, this state of affairs continued for couple of years and then one day, I called a cab, took my 8 month old daughter and walked out of their house to never return. And before divorce proceedings could start, he passed away but not before he married again while being married to me and getting his second wife pregnant. My In-Laws kicked his second wife out of the house before my husband was even cremated.
I did…24 years ago. My husband was more a best friend than a lover, but having had my heart broken by a passionate, cheating lover the previous spring I thought, “Well, Paul will never cheat. He's a good guy, and we agree on politics, religion, money, goals, etc. This one I should marry.” It didn't occur to me that the limited nature of our physical relationship wasn't strictly as a result of his religious upbringing.Imagine my surprise when on my 4 day honeymoon, we had sex twice…That was UNTIL I allowed him to take explicit pictures of me in my lingerie. After we had them developed at a 1-hr Photomat (anyone remember those?)? In the last day on our honeymoon, we had intercourse 3 times. Each time, however? He'd take time to look at those pictures before he crawled into bed…it should have set off alarm bells, “Abort! Abort! Get an annulment!“ but it didn't. I just vaguely sensed that something was really odd…So, fast forward a couple weeks. We're moving in together and I notice 3 LARGE boxes off in the corner of what was to be our “spare" bedroom. They were FILLED with VHS tapes of every type of porn imaginable (Some things? I'd never even heard of!).I confronted him, but he refused to get rid of them. I kept on and threatened to get a lawyer (we hadn't had sex since the honeymoon). He agreed to get rid of the tapes…and did. I did, however concede to let him keep about a half dozen of his “favorites" (my mistake) that we could “watch together.”I was foolish enough to think the problem was solved. We did watch “together," but I quickly realized, he wasn't focusing on me.In short, Paul has been severely addicted to porn (using multiple times/day) and has REFUSED and/or been UNABLE to have sexual relations with me (w/o porn present) for over 20 years.My two children were both conceived through combined use of alcohol and porn. It's the only thing that worked...It aches to think about the years I’ve spent alone and lonely in my marriage. It horrifies me to realize I was willing to debase myself in bed with a man who would only have sex with me if I allowed him to view porn before (or his preference, during) intercourse. When I gave in? His eyes never once left the screen. It wasn't me he was pinning down or bending over. I was just... a convenient... prop.It also sickens me to think of all the times I chose food in the middle of the night, or laid there trying to stifle my tears so no one would hear, rather than giving vent to and dealing with my true feelings.I’ve loved him and worked hard to be "a good wife" for him. I kept upgrading my appearance (until I started using food to cope), I cooked gourmet meals on a budget, handled the books, housework and laundry. I always made sure to look good when he came home from work. He never noticed.When I look back at old pictures, I am amazed. Objectively speaking, I really was pretty. (Or attractive, shapely, cute, wild, enticing, hot, beautiful... it depends on who you asked). But whatever the adjective, I knew I was a woman men appreciated and desired.And I was naive enough to believe sex wasn't going to be THAT important once a couple got married... I married my friend because he was everything my previous boyfriend was not. And THAT was a mistake. Yet, without him? My children wouldn't be who they are, so I can't completely "wish things away."That girl was pretty, smart, funny, and sexy, but she got misplaced somewhere along the way.Parts of our marriage have been good, some even great, but this one very important area feels shattered beyond repair. While some may disagree, I consider sexual expression a need, not merely a want. Like Paul said to me, "Something's broken inside." And he's right. But the brokeness is in me every bit as much as it is in him.Paul and I are friends, we finish each other's sentences, compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses, we laugh at similar things, read some of the same books, we have great kids, and we've never differed on how to raise them. We have history. We have everything... except the one thing that makes me feel the most alive, human, and feminine.I ache to once again experience the thrill of watching a man respond and eventually lose his self control and give himself to me. That moment, watching ectasy bloom on the face of a lover is the most thrilling, evocative, beautiful, powerful rush I've ever known.This is me today:The more I think about it, the more enticing an FWB (Friend With Benefits) sounds.
Yes.Not after the ceremony but even before it. Actually things happened so fast that it was out of control even before I could gather what has hit me. It was an arranged setup and hence I gave benefit of doubt to the girl who acted like someone who understood me and what I wanted as a married person. Oh boy, can’t tell how wrong was I.Our relationship lasted for around 2 months or so and I’ve never been happier taking that final call of ending it. My analysis of the whole situation is that the girl had some psychological issues which isn’t very apparent, but when you actually live with her, you realize that something is amiss (and it was a big deal as it popped up in even very minute aspects of daily life). Very short courtship period ensured that I was fooled into the entire thing quite conveniently. Add family pressure to the situation and everything for me went for a toss.Many lessons learnt in the process.Do not haste into marriage.If you’re not sure even for that 0.1%, halt everything, stop right there and rethink the entire situation.Gut feeling is the most important feeling for any person. It never lies and is barely wrong in crucial scenarios like this.Do not believe your relatives by the word. Worst creatures on the planet. Only trying to meet their ends (evil or good)
Going anonymous as my husband is on Quora.Few years into the marriage and we are still struggling to find our spot of peace. We are on a break currently due to our differences.Background: Ours was a love marriage. We belong to different states and cultural backgrounds in India. In my part of India, women are very emancipated and treated equal as men. He comes from a place where the primary duty/talent of a woman is to be a good cook. Dowry is looked down upon at my place whereas as his it is a matter of pride to show off. In short there are a lot of cultural/social differences between our families. We were in love. Few problems I could not anticipate in that heady feeling of love, several others I was not informed about by my fiancee then.A week before the wedding I was having a very uneasy feeling about everything happening around me. I started getting bouts of dizziness. Had a low hemoglobin count and had to take medications. I could not sleep and had to coax my father to give me a sleeping pill every single night.During the wedding cermonies, I came to know that the families have had a string of fights regarding customs and arrangements. When I was at the mandap, I heard my father-in-law call my folks a bunch of tribals. My heart sunk.The evening was panning out to be a horrible precursor to what was follow. Married life was never smooth. The sister in laws always carried a vendetta against me for whatever happened that day. I was expected to be good at cooking/cleaning from the word go. There is no domestic help either and I was expected to do everything. Nobody considered the fact that I was studying and working away from home most part of my adult life and I was not a mere stay at home kind of girl. My husband sadly did not do enough for me. His silence encouraged the sils even more. Apart from that there was a constant financial expection from both of us. They even expected me to contribute my salary for their expences. They say you can conquer all differences with love but sadly the love was not enough for us.I have returned to my parents to nurse my bruised soul. I might or might not return to our home. I believe all my misgivings during my marriage was my intuition warning me of the disaster ahead.My regret is that I should have loved him enough to overcome all cultural/ideological differences. Loved so much that I would have lost my identity and beliefs. Or I should have known enough about his family to take a more informed decision about him.P.S. Relatively new to Quora. So please pardon the slights in the flow of story telling :)

1 – Figure Out What Makes You Truly HappyIf you have recently gotten out of a relationship, or are simply not currently interested in anyone, then try not to look at this stage in your life as a negative thing. Being single gives you a wonderful opportunity to figure out what truly makes you happy and gives you the perfect chance to get to know yourself better.Being single grants you the time and freedom to do whatever you want on your own schedule and allows you to put your needs, desires, and ambitions above all others.Not being in a relationship will help you realize and understand that your happiness does not have to depend on someone else’s presence. You need to be able to be happy alone first, and love yourself in order to give your love to someone else and have a successful relationship.If you don’t know what is going to make you happy, how can you expect someone else to? You need to know and experience what real love and happiness is like by yourself before you commit to loving someone else.It might be scary at first but here are some ideas that can help you to feel more positive about being alone.Get to know yourself by spending some time alone in solitude. Do something that will help you relax and focus on your mind, body and soul. Go shopping, take a bath, listen to some new music, have a glass of wine, watch a marathon of your favorite show and don’t feel guilty about treating yourself or making yourself a top priority.Habit #2 – Give Yourself a Fresh StartSometimes we get stuck in monotonous schedules and our days feel like they merge together into a week that’s exactly the same as the last. Maybe you have forgotten what it’s like to feel happy because you simply aren’t stimulated with what’s happening in your life. Perhaps it’s time to write a list of all the fun things and activities that make you smile.Write down new places you would like to explore, games you would like to learn how to play, or books you would like to read. Once you start making this list, you will look forward to trying these new things and you will start to get excited about the possibilities available to you.Sometimes all it takes to feel refreshed and happy is to change something simple out of your daily routine. Maybe it’s time to rearrange your furniture or redecorate your house.By changing something in your surroundings, it will help you start fresh and prevent you from feeling like your life is stagnant. You can also look at moving, rearranging or redecorating your house to create an instant fresh start or renewal of your current stage in life.Plan a cleaning or de-cluttering session. Get rid of things that are collecting dust or that you have been hanging on to because you’ll feel guilty if you throw them out. Remember that it’s time to start living for you and no one else. Only keep things that make you happy, are important, useful and meaningful to you.Habit #3 – Practice Self-LoveSelf-love is a state of appreciation for oneself that grows from actions that support our physical, psychological and spiritual growth. [source] When you stop thinking about how other people can make you happy and practice self-love, you will soon realize what it feels like to be happy alone and be able to learn to love and accept yourself from the inside out.Here are some ways you can practice self-love:Stop putting so much value on what others think and stop striving for perfection. Everyone has their flaws whether they tell you or not. Once you have accepted that being alone is normal and natural, you will begin to realize that it’s okay and be perfectly happy while alone.Alone time will allow you to be mindful of your thoughts and surroundings. You will be able to feel happiness and peace and know that you have absolutely everything inside of yourself that you need to be completely fulfilled. You do not need to expect anything from anyone else.A great way to practice self-love includes writing down things that you love about yourself. Focus on the positives; you are healthy, unique and have great hair, wonderful personality,nice legs, beautiful eyes, or whatever you decide.You can also practice self-love by being aware of your negative thoughts. If you are constantly thinking with a dark cloud overhead then you will never leave room to let the sunshine through. There is a positive side and a negative side to almost any situation. Train your mind to think of the positive outcome and, over time, this will start to happen naturally.Another way to get out of the negative thought clouds is to surround yourself with positive things and people. If you are at a low point, you might not even want to get off of the couch and reach for the phone but it’s important to get out of the house and be around friends and family who love you and who will help you take your mind off of whatever it is that’s bringing you down.If you tend to avoid the phone or make plans, then try committing to something up front. If you commit to something, then you will be less likely to back out when the time comes to actually do it.Here’s an example: Pre-pay for a 10-week kickboxing class or sports league. Once you have made that up front long-term commitment, it will be much harder for you to say no to these plans, even when you are having a bad day.Habit #4 – Exercise and Build a Healthy LifestyleMaybe it’s time to reconnect with yourself on a physical level. Start a new exercise program that will help you get into shape, feel good about your body, and even reap the numerous benefits of endorphins.Working out shouldn’t always seem like a chore, there are some great programs like spinning, zumba, or even Xbox games that will allow you workout with others in a fun way. If you commit to joining a class and have a friend that signs up with you, you will be less likely to quit and you will have double the fun while you workout.If you do not wish to make a big commitment, then start out small and check out some different types of workouts in free workout tutorials on YouTube to see which ones fit you best. Make these new exercises a part of your morning routine so it will keep you refreshed during the day. The best part about morning workouts is that you won’t be thinking about having to workout for the rest of the day because it’s already done!If you have a dog, you should have no problem going for a daily 20-minute walk or run. Your dog will love you for it and will help keep you committed by reminding you that it’s time for your daily walk; how can you say no to those cute little puppy eyes?What’s eating you; or more like, what are you eating? Sometimes our diet can affect our happiness and bring our mood down. Take a look at what you have been eating, and look for healthier alternatives. A great way to do this is to use an app or diary for one week and write down everything that you have consumed. You might be surprised at just how much unhealthy food you are eating and when you review your journal at the end of the week, you will be able to see where there’s room for improvement in your diet.In addition to the quality of the food we eat, the quantity of the food we eat can also effect our moods and happiness. Often people turn to food when they begin to feel sad and depressed. Eating can give some quick relief but it is always followed by self-recriminations if you eat too much. Not only that but consuming large amounts of food can lead to lethargy. Simply by controlling portion sizes of the food we eat, we not only help to keep ourselves healthier, but also happier.Sleep is also extremely important in order to keep you energized throughout the day and it even has the added benefits of helping you lose weight and keeping a healthy lifestyle, mind, and heart. [Creating good sleep habits] Go to bed early and sleep in once in a while, but make sure you find a balanced schedule. One of the best benefits of being alone is that you can take up the whole bed without getting kicked or nudged in your sleep!Habit #5 – Find Your Passion and Cultivate ItIs there something you’ve always wanted to do but keep putting it off? What’s wrong with trying it now? When you’re alone, you no longer have to consider other people’s plans. Choose to do something different that will be a challenge for you. It doesn’t matter what it is. It just needs to be something that you’re passionate about.If you love animals, why not volunteer once a week to help out your local shelter? If you’re stuck on ideas, then there are many fun websites that can help you out with this decision; local dance classes, art classes, photography classes, acting lessons, cooking classes, day trips, guitar lessons you name it, you can find it in your area.Sometimes we don’t truly find our passion in life until we have tried and experienced many different things. You should keep in mind that there is never any harm in trying something new and experiencing something new can actually be quite fun. It will get you out of the house, allow you to be around new and positive people and help you renew your confidence for learning new things.Habit #6 – Step Out of Your Comfort ZoneTry doing things that you’ve never done before. Try not to have your guard up and be open to all possibilities; you don’t know that you won’t like something until you’ve tried it.A great way to step out of your comfort zone is to go somewhere and do something new and fun each week.Another great thing about being alone is that no one is there to say no or disagree with your plans.When you start experiencing new things, places and events, you will probably be meeting new people and make some new friends. This may seem difficult at first if you are shy but putting yourself in other people’s shoes might help. Remember that it may be hard for someone else to make friends too and you could be that one person that could help someone else out.Remember to do things that benefit your inner-self and not for the purpose of finding “someone.” There shouldn’t be any pressure to look at people romantically.Stepping out of your comfort zone and trying new things can lead to new friends and amusing experiences. It all starts with you smiling and saying hello to someone else. Try saying hi with a smile when you’re at the grocery store, while you’re walking down the street, when you’re meeting someone for the first time at a party, etc.Whatever the situation is, just try to put yourself out there and you’ll gain more confidence over time, eventually this will turn into a new habit. Seeing other people smile is also contagious so if you start the smile train, others will reciprocate and you will both be in great moods.A good way to keep yourself out of your comfort zone is to try a 30 day habitevery month. Make sure to try new things, experiment and do things you might not do otherwise. You may even find some great habits you want to keep forever.Habit #7 – Use Your Alone Time WiselyMany people might think that the answer to being happy is a simple one: just do things that make you happy.However, due to psychological attachments, this is not true at all. You may enjoy chowing down on a quart of Rocky Road ice-cream. You may enjoy watching an entire season of Dexter in a single sitting. But in the long run these things will not bring you the happiness you desire and are quite likely to bring you guilt and remorse.There are many things you can do when you’re alone and watching meaningless TV shows or eating your favorite comfort food might seem like a great idea at the time, but for purposes of happiness they are often counterproductive.I am not saying to never enjoy mindless tasks or have a treat, these can be okay once in a while, but why not use this time wisely and get to know yourself better,, learn something about yourself or challenge your mind.Read a great biography, watch an inspirational documentary, start a new business or create a new website. Lose yourself in your art, music, woodworking, cooking or any other meaningful work.Need some inspiration? Spend all day at a gallery or museum and let your mind experience different reactions and emotions to these art pieces or educational experiences. Choose your time wisely and make sure that at the end of the day, you were happy and satisfied with what you accomplished.Remember, at this point in your life, you are alone so you are able to create something meaningful and spend as much time as you like doing what you love to do. When you lose yourself fully into your work, you will become proud of what you have created and this will leave you fulfilled and happy.Creating smart and realistic goals attached with a timeline will help keep you motivated. Start off small and focus on your most important tasks first. Once you get into a routine, you will not even have to think about your daily to-do schedule because you will have programmed your mind to just do it and get it done.Another great advantage of being alone is that your goals do not need to involve any outside influences. You can be, do, and have whatever you dream of. You can create an amazing future for yourself, and by yourself.Why not take this time to focus on one or two aspects of your life that you have wanted to improve. Whether this involves your health, career, spirituality or finances, don’t let these wants and aspirations continue to be pushed to the side.Think about how you would feel and why it would be beneficial to have all aspects of your life in order and under control and you will be able to envision a brighter future, which will help motivate you to pursue and stick with your goals.Habit #8 – Learn to Appreciate the PresentWe are who we become because of our life experiences from the past. Forgive yourself and acknowledge your mistakes from the past. Remember that the past does not always dictate your future. We all make mistakes and your mistakes do not define whom you are or whom you could be. Learn from mistakes, but celebrate the small wins of the present.Think of the person that you were 5, 10, or 25 years ago. There will be many challenges, situations and obstacles that will come and go our way during our lives. If you had never made any mistakes or harbored any flaws, what type of person would you be now? What types of experiences would you have had and how happy would you really be if you were striving to be perfect for your whole life?Life can be busy and hectic enough, sometimes just having the time to sit back and enjoy a nice cup of green tea could be something that can refresh and revive you. Don’t think of the things you do not have but live in the “now” and appreciate the small things in life that help you relax and enjoy what you have in life to it’s fullest.http://www.newsnytro.com/

Why it is important to learn to live alone?
How do I learn to live alone ?
You can't really learn to live alone, but you can sort of ease into it. The key is to be able to enjoy alone time. Try doing things by yourself such as going for a vacation alone or going for a movie alone or planning to go out for lunch/ dinner by yourself or even cooking for yourself. If you enjoy doing these (and other similar) things on your own, then you are already on your way to enjoying solitude. If not, then start by making these experiences enjoyable. For example, if you don't like cooking just for yourself (most people don't!), try putting on your favourite music while you're cooking. Also, plan and cook special/ new things, like you would if you had company. Do something similar for other daily activities too.Use the alone time to do things you may not have been able to do had you been cohabiting. For example, learning to play a musical instrument or a dance form. This will occupy you as well as divert your attention from being alone.Then there is the lighter side to it as well. You can find comfort in that you can take longer showers without having anyone banging on your bathroom door, you can watch ridiculous TV soaps without being judged, you can eat ice cream straight out the bucket (:P) without being told off and so on.One last piece of advice. Living alone can sometimes take a toll. You never know when you slip into being lonely. To counter that, you should ensure that you have a daily routine and stick to it. At the same time, stay open to changes like going out with friends, someone coming over for dinner etc. Be in regular touch with friends and family. Even if they can't be physically present, talking or video chatting with them will do you good.And finally, I wrote a quote on my blog post once that I would like to share here:There is a difference between being alone and being lonely: know it. Don't ever be afraid of being alone. And don't get too used to being lonely.p.s. - These thoughts are coming from someone who has never lived alone, although very much desires to. But I have managed to create my own space (physically as well as mentally) even while cohabiting, where I am able to enjoy solitude. I also travel solo, go for movies/ shopping/ coffee on my own.p.p.s. - If you don't want to live alone, get a dog. I know I will get one when I go off to live alone.Cheers,
How do we learn to live alone?
Living alone is perhaps the most arduous task given you crave attention and interaction with people. Being alone gives you power to handle and an opportunity to get head to head with situations without any help that indeed make you stronger at the end.Loving your solitude is an art not everyone is profound at. It takes suffering and a paramount patience to get to that point. I can't say I still love being alone but to some extent I have learnt to accept these emotions and entailing emptiness.So how do we learn to live alone…..When after Doing everything to please the person you like to be with you leave you empty with your own depreciating thoughts to deal with.When your love for other is deemed an annoyance ,like you are infringing upon their life.When people contact you only when they require something, and when you need help everyone gets invisible in jiffy.When your respect is marred owing to your humble and affable nature .When you are judged , ridiculed for you not-so-great look .When you are unable to convey your pain to other ,and slowly learn to deal with your own.When you try to get relief with your pain by getting into trivial relationship and ends in a thud.When no one loves to give you company and their precious time.When slowly but painfully you learn that solitude is perhaps better than someone by your side.When you learn that when alone you will not be hurt by anyone. That no one will leave you in excruciating cringe,that might take years to heal.Yes , initially it was gloomy, perhaps spooky to get through it. But yes , eventually you will realise it's ensconcing abode . Where you will get all creativity shooting forth.So it's good to be alone……..You will never learn to worship God within ,If you are craving for its embodiment outside.GS……
How do I learn to live alone ?
Well it depends on the type of goals you have in your life.Let me explain it.If you are going to be a coder, sits on a computer. Then write some blogs in your free time. By some time, you will be in your professional stage this thing will eventually compound and you will see the results later.If you are going to be a person at administration: read some newspapers.If you are going to an entrepreneur: read books.I know the above answers are bad. You read about them at some platform and constantly want new answers, facts, basically you want new, new.So what I'm trying to say thay instead of sitting still in your reckliner, find some hobby, passion, which drives you for the day.Visit library, go for a long drive, run in the morning, eat healthy, watch news, watch Netflix, see the war between world, install 9gag use Firefox, do squats, organize your room, change the sitting arrangement at your place, do painting, learn martial arts, change habits, read books.And remember change your habits it will change you, believe me.Thank you.Get a dog.

How do I prepare to live alone?
I looked at Find Your Spot | Find Your Spot to find the place I would best fit. Several places popped up.Then I did homework about the places I found at City-Data.com - Stats about all US cities - real estate, relocation info, crime, house prices, cost of living, races, home value estimator, recent sales, income, photos, schools, maps, weather, neighborhoods, and moreWhen I found the place I wanted to live, I went to several rental websites like Apartments for Rent - Rent.com® Apartment Finder and other rental websites in the new town.I found a lot of apartments but most of them were very expensive. I printed out the information sheets and map locations for about six different locations in different parts of town so I could choose the right neighborhood.Since the location was over a thousand miles from my home town I found a hotel near the airport with low weekly rates. I planned to fly there and stay a week, rent a car to drive around and look at the apartments.I did like one apartment on my list, but driving around I found another apartment building that was older, and off the radar. It was even cheaper and better than the cheapest one on my list.I had to sign a two year lease and the move-in date was a minimum of another week away so they could prepare my new apartment. I flew home again, packed up my car and drove to my new apartment.I needed money for a two-way flight and car rental, hotel, gas for the rental car, gas for my car, hotels when I drove across country, rental deposit, first month's rent, a new bed (used furniture are against the apartment's policy because of the risk of bed bugs). Luckily I didn't bring any furniture with me and I could furnish my new apartment with better fitting furniture.The whole move cost was at least $3,000 but I would plan on having more than that just in case, but do not carry large amounts of cash because it might be seized by police who suspect you of drug dealing.
What is the best advice for a person who is beginning to live alone?
There will be a time, when you close the door and sit down. Then there will be silence. And then it happens... You will know what I mean when it happens. It is a special feeling. You are alone, nobody will enter your room, you are not responsible for anyone but you. This can get a certain dynamic.In a bad way it can lead to inertness. You are missing the drive and sit around. Or it can get boredom or in worst cases even more...However, this can also be the most beautiful time. Then, when you realize that being alone with yourself is a perfect chance to experience yourself. You can treat yourself nice, you can meditate (take this advice serious), you can read... you are not responsible for anyone... and if you sit with open doors in your restroom, nobody is bothered... if you sing in your room, nobody is bothered... if you run naked through your room... etc. Enjoy this freedom. See it as most enjoyable time with someone you love (with yourself). Soon enough this might change again... And when you are married and have lots of children, you might miss that time.

Living alone initially can be difficult and sad. There's no doubt about it, you need some time to get accustomed to a particular environment. However, learning to live alone is the most peaceful thing on Earth, you don't have to bother or rely on someone else, you learn things on your own, which means you become more independent, and living alone also makes you understand life better.Never forget the difference between living alone and being lonely,To live alone is always a positive way to approach life.However, being pessimistic about life and yourself will make you lonely. Never try mixing the two terms together.Good luck!

How do I begin to live alone?
For the first time or is it after a death or sudden being alone?For the first time then check its viable financialy,if so then set up the money so you always have a roof over your head and food in the cupboard.A routine is good,with the cleaning and so on.Set days/times things are to be done and try and stick to it.Set aside time for yourself out of the home,additional to work,maybe a gym or golfing,book club,shooting whatever but get a hobby so you meet different people.Cook proper food for yourself,it gets you out shopping and is theraputic at night cooking a meal,also saves getting on the junk food wagon and is cheaper.I loved living alone,I read a lot,sometimes at home,the park,the pub even on a afternoon.But you need other people in your life so make sure you do something,anything to make you go out a few times a week.I suppose the same applies after a death,being totally alone all the time is never good for you so make a effort,as hard as it can be.

What is it like to be married?
Awesome!You get to wake up with the one you loveYou know that you are lovedYou feel safe in that you know what your routines areThere is a deeper more comfortable love that forms and is more powerful than the short term After 8 years I have really got to know my wife and that means we can know what she is thinking and know how to be there for herIt is a more selfless way of being You get to learn different ways of seeing things from a female perspective and she can learn a masculine perspective also.If things get hard you know that your real only option is to sort it out. Somehow this makes it easierYou don't have to worry about the crap of clubbing, drunk people, uncertainty of whether this person is interesting or whether they are interested in youIn conclusion don't marry just anyone, find someone, that you are sure you want to be with. Then you get to bet half of everything you own that you want them and only them for the rest of your life.If you get it right, then you win the lottery.

What will make a married man cheat on his wife?
This question is a big question. I take marriage as living together and sharing responsibility for a very long time (hopefully to death). The legal piece is just a piece of paper.For me, it has many emotional and material benefits. Assuming you got married to a kind and genuine person.Emotional benefits:1- You mutually decide to have a very long term relationship with someone you love. This trait is hard to find, so wonderful and easy to take for granted.2- Life is not easy. Even for us, who have good jobs and relatively good situations, sometimes life is hard and depressing. Sometimes you lose control of your emotions in the hurdle of life. Reminding each other to be grateful for what we have, in those hard times, is priceless.3- Being able to share pretty much everything, and discuss pretty much everything. Now, this is something you can’t find with many people. If you tell your friends that you are having a hard time at work, or arguing with your friend, they will potentially judge you, and you will reach no solution. The trusted spouse will listen to you, share her opinion, help with a real solution, and keep it to herself.4- You wake up at night, you feel like she is not breathing for a moment, sweat cold, then check and verify her breathing, become the happiest person again. That happiness is not comparable to anything else.Material benefits:1- You merge wallets, double the income, and share the costs with maybe 1.2x of your single expenses. This advantage helps to gain financial freedom easier. Requires everyone spending responsibly though.2- Share all the tedious housework and make it fun. She does vacuuming when you clean the patio, etc.3- A friend that comes to every vacation, every dinner you have, and that can carpool with you every single day. You never feel lonely. This benefit is both material and emotional.As you see, these all require two good people to get married. If one of them starts exploiting the other, things go downhill.I wish everyone find their favorite person and live a great life. Don’t listen to those who compare marriage to temporary stuff like housemates or paid services like housekeeping, etc. Life is never that material.Lastly. If you are getting ‘permissions’ from each other when married, something is wrong. There should be no permission. There should be respect instead.
What is like to be married?
2 marriages: 2 different experiencesmarriage 1: making the best of a marriage I was manipulated into. Threat of divorce made me take job as high school teacher instead of continuing education as desired. Had kids because my wife wanted them, then got vasectomy. Some happy times, but also struggle over whose needs would be met. Eventually she fell in love with her boss, told me she didn’t love me, and plunged me into deepest depression of my life.marriage 2: both madly in love and wanted marriage as commitment. 36 years so far of love expressed in words and deeds. Each delights in giving other the things he/she finds important. Feeling of partnership in making life happy for both. Quarrels, generally just because one is upset and never about anything basic, are quickly made up. We both sincerely believe life couldn’t be better than this for us, except for the long, hot summers where we live.
What is like to be married?
Is the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life! I get to wake up next to her and see your beautiful face in the morning sleeping! I get to spend the entire day with her doing things with her, conversing with her and just enjoying the blessings that God has given me! And then I get to go to bed with her at night! I can think of no better way to enjoy and soak in life. Just hearing her speak is thrilling to me. She is more than I could have ever dreamed of and more than I deserve.

Marriages is not an objective experience; it’s subjective. In other words, it depends on you! If you’re a great husband/wife, then the chances are good that you’ll have an awesome experience in your marriage. If, on the other hand, you haven’t learned the skills required to be a great spouse, then your experience in marriage will likely be quite unpleasant.

It's one of those things you won't ever understand until you get to experience yourself, and even then you still can never fully describe to an outsider what it really is like. It's one of those things nobody but the person you're sharing it with will understand once you try to explain what it's like for you, and even then no two people have the same definition of how it really is.-my hypothetical and personal view as an unmarried individual who often wonders what it would be like once I'm married

Is living alone good or bad?
“Living alone never felt right, sometimes it feels good but it never felt right.”Every now and then you need somebody by your side to share your day’s work, your feelings with them but finding not a single person in a world of billions to talk to about your problems about yourself, not a single friend and even isolating yourself from parents because they never understand you, feels like crying continuously and let that pain out or sleeping whole day to never face reality.Yes! Happiness is alone time, just me and my bed.But sometimes that room my couch my solitude sucks!Typing ‘I am good’, ‘Life is beautiful’ ,‘I am fine.’ with tears continuously rolling down your eyes and trembling fingers hurts. It chokes!The person on the other side never know how you are feeling. Telling them also don’t work often.Because sometimes it is only you who understand YOURSELF better than anyone else.And then you want to run away for a while. Get a break from everything. So that you can build yourself strong enough again, pick up that load efficiently and so that you don’t shatter in pieces. But you can’t like just run away.Because you have to face it and Be a warrior B)Happy Life :)

Living alone has pros and consThe good part is : You become independent. You will have to care of everything by yourself . One starts to eventually enjoy own company and that is essential for liberation.Conquering fear .Increased sense of responsibility.There is enough and lot of personal space and privacy. Sleep and wake up any time depending on one's convenience.    The Flip side to this:it  Will be difficult  to share the room or space with another person once you are used to this kind of freedom and space.The occasional feeling of loneliness as some times it could be boring Living alone is expensive as room Sharing is more economical you might end up paying extra for lesser comforts as compared to a peer who is sharing a room with someone.
What's bad about living alone?
I worry that I'll die and no one will realize for several months and I'll finally get my 15 minutes of fame posthumously in stories about how society forgets people.Also, that it'll be by choking on my food and no one will be around to pound my back.  I've given up eating Mint Imperials for this reason.It's lonely for the first year or so.  Then I got over it and found it quite liberating.  No one else to help with the household expenses.That's about it, for me at least.  Other people wouldn't handle it so well, especially the type who need to someone to talk to every day.
LIving alone is not a good choice. But sometimes we have to face this situation. We came to this world by alone and leaving here by alone. In between our birth and death we meet many and living as a social animal. Some circumstances make us to live alone for a periods.it is not parmanant. If we alone at home for a while, no need to worry. We can make good friends in our society.

Do single unmarried women in their 50s regret not having married or having kids?
I'm 52, never married and from the time I remember I didn't like or want kids.  I wouldn't trade my life for the drudgery and negative drama of a marriage. The suffocating albatross of children and their neediness, noise, chaos.Not all women need other people to define their self worth. I am aweome all by myself.

Will I regret not getting married?
It is human nature to want what we do not have. Those who married and had children also regret their choices. "Why didn't I stay single and free!" A person who wishes they had done the opposite is viewing the other choice as perfect --my child would have been perfect, or I would have jet-setted all over the world if I didn't have kids and a family to tie me down. They do not imagine that their child might have been a defiant, hateful, drug-addicted high school dropout. Or imagine that the carefree single life might have left them dating pilots who fork over money for abortions like coffee money. Yes, everyone wishes for the perfect life not chosen, including single childless women in their fifties.

Human psychology is such that we want what we don't have and don't appreciate what we do have. For example, I had a childhood dream of having a fair enough internet connection and playing games on websites like Cartoon Network or Pogo. I wanted it very badly back then. I used to request my elder brother to take me to cyber cafes to titillate myself with these websites and once in a while, he would agree to take me and I would fool around on the internet. But then I got a broadband connection at home and slowly, this fascination began to wear out. I realized that there's nothing more special in it than, say, sitting in a comfortable chair and reading Sherlock Holmes. Needless to say, now I don't even visit those sites at all which were my dreams a few years ago. Same goes for wanting toys. Same goes for the desire for an iPhone. Same goes for needing a partner. Though, it's comforting in the beginning to have someone caring for you but then again, I believe our psychology kicks in and the fascination wears out eventually. People generally don't find their partner that scintillating after 3 to 5 years of marriage, so far as I have observed.You wrote, "You don't feel it now, but when you're older and your siblings are busy with their own family, you'll be lonely." Now that's not necessarily going to be true. Rather than attaching yourself to a person, you could keep yourself engaged in a pursuit, i.e. a goal. You could learn mountaineering, scuba diving, watch online lectures on history, physics, French Revolution, programming, attend dance and music classes, read excellent literature classics or do whatever interests you (which you otherwise wouldn't have much time to do, if you had family or kids). That way, you'd be engaged in worthy activities and won't feel lonely. Loneliness is, after all, a state of mind. You can even feel lonely if you're sitting in a crowd, if you catch my drift.

Do you regret not getting married and being single?
Never.. I am happy on my own! I love myself fully and i dont need another half to complete me and rather want someone as a whole! This Era is filled with the hype of being in relationship and there are supporting dating sites and social platforms where u encounter ample of profiles suggesting u a partner to fill the so called "void".. thats for those who are lonely and cant enjoy life! I have been on my own since years and mostly  independent along with friends and family to love and support me through thick and thin.. my happiness solely depends on me In my opinionNobody can love u more than You coz You understand yourself better than anyone !!
She is probably right from a very practical point. I am 28 as well, not ready to get married any time soon, I have a friend who is commitment phobic too and we really love each other (but don't want to get confess it, yes, we never spoke about it), so officially I am single. I don't regret any of it but, some how (weak moments you know) I feel the need of someone when nobody will be around. Parents wont live forever, my sister is already busy with her family. I don't get to meet my friends every weekend.Yes, to have somebody to spend your holidays (where you know he/she will be there no matter what) that would be nice. The feeling is nice. But the phobia of commitment kills the joy. So no regret! 
Ahh.. question seems to have perception of yours, your mom's, and on that your asking others that being single is regretful ?May be, what she is trying to say that you will miss few awsome moments of life by being single.I am not saying being single will ruin your life, or will take away joy etc. hell no! its freedom that you are enjoying, loving and wanting to live same way.however, if you see from her eyes, she saw you growing which is best part of life one can ever experience! to see cute sweet little kid entering in your world and making you say We from I!  when your hungry, probably you will go for maggie at home or pizza ordering, but its nothing as compared to mom's hand made paratha's full of love & ghee too ! ;) .you feel joy of presence in family when you have others in life as part of your family.to find friend in form of husband, to share your views, to get motivation from them when you yourself feel doubtful about what you doing!I personally feel, life is all about living with others, to share happiness, joy, to help each other.Nothing is perfect in life, relationships,people, nothing, but its commitment we show in it that makes us different, positive and strong and unique from others. your mom is telling you to see all this to experience all this in life.And last but not least, there is nothing called marrying wrong guy/girl.think 10000 times before jumping into it, but once your in, dont give it up so easily.cos if you say person is wrong, then mind you, you are wrong too since you selected him/her!Just a perception! do think about it ! afterall, we all need jaadu ki jhappi! :)

No, I never regret being single.Being single is the best part of life since you are independent. After certain age for eg after 32-35 you need a partner to move forward in your life.Being single you can do anything you want, u never feel jealous also. You can do anything you want. When your workloads increases you needs someone to make you relax,to make you happy, to be with you entire your life, to support you and at last at your last stage of your life you need someone with whom you can spend time happily.
I am 30 yrs old and single. I do want to settle down at some point and almost did when I was 27. But for whatever reasons it didn't materialise. So not going in any further details, here is in nutshell my learning from life so far: Each one of us has a different journey in life. We are not in school or college anymore where everyone has a single goal with a timeline; pass the class the same year. Life is a much bigger and grander affair. Do things that make you happy right now. Pursue things you want to right now. If you don't feel like settling down then don't. Especially for a big decision like marriage, the worst thing you can do is to marry for the wrong reason! If ever you meet the one and feel like getting married then do! Else stay single. Whatever you decide to do, make sure you live a life true to yourself!
I am rather happily married for 32 years now and fully endorse your mother's view. If you are not committed to something, which requires you to remain unmarried for the time being, you are wasting your time. To remain unmarried is not an achievement, without some specific purpose. Marriage is not a burden, it is a social responsibility and it gives you everything in life-- meaning, purpose, fulfilment. So be serious about it, before it is too late.Turn a new leaf, start a new chapter of life and you will enjoy it, will be benefited by it. Best Wishes !
I'm 33 & single and for me, not really. That's not to say I don't get thoughts of wanting a life companion or a family, especially when seeing friends in moments of marital & familial bliss. But those thoughts are fleeting, and are readily countered with "Thank god I'm not in THAT relationship" when seeing friends in dysfunctional, manipulative and even abusive relationships.But more importantly, I'm a fairly spontaneous free spirit - and the idea of constantly checking in on where I'm going or what I'm doing seems stifling. On a similar note, I don't feel the need to be updated every time my S.O. wants to do their thing. So while I'm open to the idea of a relationship, it will likely be a paradoxical-sounding "let's be together... separately" one.And like others said, do what makes you happy; if you decide that you do want a significant other later in life, you can easily put yourself out there in search of one.
No, atleast not yet. What is there to regret? Tesla in his old age felt that he should have accepted the proposal s he had at his disposal of a potential life companion. May be a sense of rejection may stem out, a feeling of not being compatible with the construct of the world around us. And after that there is nothing to feel bad about. Our parents did their 'job' of raising kids to the level of self sustainance. Now they expect us to do the same which is not bad as we have a social fabric to maintain. There could be a regret like a cone of ice cream that you didn't try, and we the monkey see monkey do humans feels bad when we are not acting like the other monkey. So don't take a decision just because you feel that you'll regret not taking it. Take your time. Good luck

What are some reasons why people are single?
Let's make a checklist for all the essential things to get committed and the challenges in each step. (More suited for an average Indian guy)Interest in a relationship :- A lot of people are genuinely not interested in/aware of  a relationship up to some age. Deeply engrossed in higher studies , career , financial commitments etc . Heard of noble gases ? Yeah , they don't fucking bond with anything so easily because they are so complete and self absorbed.Time :- Okay , now you feel its time to start dating , but do you have time for that ? Are you in a job that sneaks into the nooks and corners of your life ? Is your course too demanding of your time ?Contacts :- Okay now you have interest and time , but where do you find girls ? The most common ways are school friends , college , workplace. Now some people could have studied in a gents school . College or workplace might have an unfairly skewed ratio of 1 girl per 50 guys e.g Reputed engineering colleges and Reputed Software MNCs ( Nothing misogynistic here , I am just giving my observation ) And just so you don't tell me about HR dept, Let me tell you something  "One simply doesn't mess with the HR Department".Expectations :- Okay , luckily you happen to know some girls you can reach out to. But do they meet your expectations ? You are so awesome (at least , that's what you think ) that most of the girls you know don't match your expectations in some way or the other. And you are too nice/decent to hit on random girls or send "fraandship requests" .Courage/Drive  :- Okay , you have finally narrowed down on a girl who matches everything you are looking for. What next ? Make romantic advances to her ! Did that just send a tingle down your spine ? Understandable ! Are you too lazy to initate ? Understandable .Skill :- Okay , now you have finally mustered some courage/drive and take a do or die approach . Good ! Now start talking . Sure , let's talk about .... mmm ... uhhh .. oh crap ! what will I talk about ? Availability :- Okay , you have the necessary skill and you are just too good at smooth talk. You initiate the conversation and become an instant hit. You connect so well , that she tells you about her boyfriend !! BAMM . You hit the wrong girl son !Friend zone :- Okay , she is not committed. You talk for hours , you get to know each other . But you know , she just thinks of you as a good friend. BAMM . You prepared Maths for a History exam dude !! Mutual Interest :- Okay , she doesn't friend zone you . But she rather does not want to get involved in relationships either ! She likes you but won't love you . Because her family is orthodox , about to be engaged , does not believe in relationships , different caste/religion etc.  BAMM . Dead End !!Commitment :- Okay , everything is fine. She is kinda falling for you . Mission Accomplished !! Now what ? Propose and get committed. Whhaatt ? The mere word "commitment" sends me on diarrhea for weeks. I am not ready for commitment yet !  One girl for years ? OMG !There you go ! See , It is not as easy as it sounds ! It requires a blessing from heaven to get all 10 steps aligned ! Screw up at any step and GAME OVER . Start the game all over again .From my experience , I have seen most guys blocked and fumbling around at the third or fourth step itself.It more or less feels like this

Why are some people always single?
Are single people happier?
Why are you still single?
Why are so many decent people single nowadays?
Why am I single?
Several reasons but one needs special mention:They want to be single!Being single bestows upon them the below-mentioned privileges and more:They may decide to stay home for the weekend doing nothing, nothing at all! No message or call can change that decision. No one to give justification to.The freedom to say ‘NO’ is all theirs. They don’t need to do anything unless they really want to do it.Solo trips to any place, any time.Abundance of time to work on things that matter (priorities)Being broke for a long time doesn’t hurt.No judgements. There’s no one who is trying to bring them ‘up’ to the standard.Nobody expects them to behave in a certain way or behaves erratically if they don’t behave that way.Not to forget, the freedom to appreciate (check out) the beauty of the opposite sex and the ability to be friends with several of them.Sure, most of us have to give up these privileges some time in our lifetime, but what’s the hurry? And yes, I’m happy for those who have found the one for whom they have done it already. I hope it’s worth it :)Being in a relationship (ideally) brings physical and emotional happiness. But have we explored all the possible ways of reaching the same state? (Hint: food, nature, travel, hobbies, or even work)A lot of us find it scary to spend time in our own company, an underrated source of happiness (no kidding :P). Since when has it become a ‘thing’ to be in a relationship after a particular age?Several are in a relationship just for their physical needs, letting their partners dream up a future which will never come true. Who are they kidding? Openness can go a long way in keeping physical and emotional dependence separate. Better for both involved.Let’s not double up until and unless we’re absolutely sure of the reasons!Cheers :)PS: No, I have not had a history of girlfriends who were control freaks. Peace.
Single?This answer is going to annoy many.See. People marry because they want to have a family. Sex. Children.We humans woo the opposite gender, we say we are in love, then get married and produce children.Then what?Nothing. It continues and has continued for centuries.The same is for other animals too, though they dont get married to produce. They just do it.They woo their best possible mate and reproduce which continues.So, what i basically want to say that we living beings has no role on earth other than continuing our genes.Even if we humans or any other living being is going to get extinct the universe is going to lose nothing.So, coming back to question on why i am single.Since i am already born on the earth, i believe that instead of reproducing i must focus on other thing, because 99.99% of my human race wilk take care of that.My views are:Instead of reproducing i want to help those children who are already born but deprived of basic human needs.I want to spread the truth to people of all countries and all religious groups that since we homo sapiens have brain .USE it. No matter what your religious text says or the laws of the country is. Do not challenge the nature. Do not utilize the resources beyond its carrying capacity. Do not mess with other living creature. LET THEM LIVE. Since they do not have unions, does not agitate, doesn't mean they are useless.Instead of spreading my genes and taking pride of my geaneology i believe whole human race as one. Whether one stays in Nepal Or Canada, working towards betterment of planet must be the sole aim.Limit human population. Share resources. Give to the poor. People born poor have not done anything wrong. It was a mistake by their poor parents. They just did it in lust. Did not think what their children will eat or wear.Stop this nonsense country divide or boundary. If nature doesn't differentiate between countries when calamities arises how we foolish human have the right to make boundaries.I will be back and add soon more. There is very long list… meanwhile. HAPPY GENE SPREADING.
What are some reasons why people are single?
I can't help but say I'm annoyed by responses to this question that assume there is something wrong with single-hood.  Something wrong with the person, else why would they be single?  I know that many single people would prefer not to be, and I know many people who choose to be.  I also know people such as my brother who really must be in a relationship, it's how they are built.  Before my brother met his wife I used to "pray" that if there were a love of my life out there, please give it to my brother because he needs that and I'm fine by myself.  Some people yearn to raise children and while there are all flavors of family and circumstances, I can easily understand why the family minded seek a more traditional framework of marriage to accomplish that.  Why is it beyond comprehension that a person might choose to live independently? Being single is my lifestyle choice.  I was engaged to be married in 1995.  I was with the guy for 8 years or so, living together.  I had other live-in relationships before that.  My former fiance wanted marriage so badly that I tried to give it to him because I loved him.   But a month before the wedding I had to admit to myself I was dreading my future.   When I called off my wedding, I just faced up to it:  I am not cut out to be in a romantic relationship.  I'm extremely independent and I prefer it that way.  I don't like to feel I owe anybody anything.  I am not good at making men feel "needed" (heard that from my fiance and another former live-in lover).  I don't need, and I really (really!) don't enjoy being needed by another.  It makes me feel claustrophobic. I could go on but it strikes me as I follow this question how many people can't fathom the idea that a person might CHOOSE to be single, or perhaps not having chosen it, find they enjoy it.   My life is very full with friends, family, hobbies, and career.  I can improve myself because I have so much time to self-reflect.  There are many responses here to support why a person might choose to be single.  I just don't get how many can't accept this life style.  We are passing gay marriage laws in state after state.  Even if many of us are not gay, we understand that some of us are and have the right to marry and have traditional families.  There are many examples of life styles that are not like the one we choose for ourselves, why is it so hard to understand this one?

What are some reasons why people are single?
At 19, I CHOOSE to stay single because of the following reasons:1. I just got off a bad breakup with my first loveWonderful girl when I first met her but at my age, people change like mad because we are drastically looking for an identity to settle with. Drifted apart to only find out from her sister that my ex cheated on me. I did date several girls after the breakup and got into a relationship which lasted barely for a month. I realised I am not willing and unable to commit my time to a single person after the breakup, which leads on to the next point.2. I love the freedom of being single!I don't have to worry about my girlfriend getting wasted at the club and cheating on my back. I don't have to deal with the quarrels which imo, a bloody waste of time at 19. This time is better off for myself to indulge in my hobbies. I also get to bed several girls without the label of a cheater! (Afterall, we all just wanna have fun right?) Being single gives me lots of time to build myself stronger and honestly, I do attract girls more when I'm single! I don't have to attend to my girlfriend.3. I don't settle for anyone.At 19, I want to meet more people. Every person is unique and talking to them will inspire me and expand my knowledge. I do not wish to revolve my entire world around a single girl because of my intellectual curiosity. I don't want to look back and say: 'I wasted my time with that single girl when I could have....:SINGLE CAN BE AWESOME (except you might feel a little lonely somedays).By staying single, I do what I want and is able to explore the boundaries. And by settling with someone, I get into a comfort zone (Hell no! I wanna push the boundaries and see what I can do with my potential)Despite saying this, I love to be in love. But I want to be in love with someone who I can be extremely proud of, and not someone who I treat as a booty call. And the timing now is not great for me to be attached.HENCE I AM SINGLE!
Many people would suggest how awesome it is to be single and blah blah. But I disagree.I think it’s a choice which we all make based on circumstances.Unfortunately my last relationship where despite having exchanged rings, ended with her being in some other dude’s arm.It left a hole in me that might have filled but deep down I know, I have serious trust issues. I know maybe this girl is awesome, she’s kind, she’s sweet, she won’t ever betray me, but then again the doubt factor.It’s like, yeah I want to share. I want to tell someone about my life. I want someone whom I can call, tell how much happy I was today, how much sometimes I need motivation, but I know I just can’t.I might say i have great friends. The best I know. But then sometimes you know, you can’t share everything with your friends, well at-least not me.But let me assure you, I am perfectly fine. It’s not as if am dying, but the fact is sometimes, Yes I miss the feeling of love, I miss expressing everything to someone. Despite the fact I share everything with my mother but I know she is my Mother and she is not a woman to burden my problems with. She did a great job raising me into a fine Young Decorated Officer and now it’s my job to be there for her.Maybe yes I miss telling and discussing Twilight with some. Maybe I miss being someone’s Edward Cullen. Maybe I miss saying, Always.What is stopping me? Trust issues.I try to resolve it. I seemingly feel am headed in the right direction. I know I will find Love. I have to. It is the most beautiful feeling in the world. It’s an undying flame of passion and love that never extinguishes.Sometimes people have a hard time believing am single. I have to prove it. But those who understand me know why am single. I feel with every relationship failed, we loose a bit of ourselves which once defined us. I lost that bit and that remaining bit is locked somewhere safe for the lady that will grace my Life with her presence.I guess there is nothing more beautiful than Love. Especially when you are with the right person. Everything seems beautiful for when you lie down on the mountains across the grass under the less intense Sunshine, you do find Velvet flowers bloom out next.
What are some reasons why people are single?
I used to have an argument with this ethics professor of mine at least once a week over the difference between a reason and an excuse.  I believe that there is a definable difference between the two.  A reason is a justification for something, an excuse is something you offer up as justification for failure.  You don't give excuses for winning and you don't give reasons for losing.  I hear a lot of excuses for being single, but rarely do I hear reasons that make a lot of sense.  This leads me to a number of different conclusions.First and foremost: a majority of people are not single by choice.  Perhaps you haven't found the perfect person yet, maybe you're "not settling" for less than "you deserve."  Again these sound like excuses and they often are but many people think that making excuses is a bad thing.  It's not always a bad thing to make excuses.  But we take things so personally that even the perception of someone or something being different is enough to send us running in the opposite direction.Second: our standards are too high.  I've been single all my life and I'm pretty sure that this has been the chief culprit leading to the perhaps inevitable break-up of nearly ninety percent of my relationships.  It's like a checklist and if I can't check all the boxes I start souring on the relationship.  I call this the "un-single" test.  If you start thinking of someone as marriage material that checklist gets much longer as you start thinking about whether you'd be willing to spend the rest of your life with this person.  I think as we get older we lower our standards a bit, but whether this leads to successful relationships is a topic that is still being debated.Third: needs are different for both parties in a relationship.  Like I said before I approach dating with a mental checklist and I like being able to check off the boxes.  One thing that I value above everything else is my independence and it seems a lot of times like independence and relationships are somewhat anti-thetical.  Relationships inevitably take away some of our independence, but how much is too much?  I haven't been able to strike the right balance and part of the problem is that I'm a writer so by definition I'm weird, quirky, and I need a good deal of me time to think through my ideas.  At the same time having someone to bounce ideas off of can be invaluable.  Striking a balance is where things get complicated and my feeling is that I'm not alone in having an issue with personal independence and some of the co-dependence that comes from being in a committed relationship.Fourth: what was once cute is now annoying.  We've all been there.  Maybe she's got a great laugh or she flips her hair a certain way when she's talking, whatever it is it's something that makes her unique and that's what we're looking for when we're dating.  But there's a difference between dating and putting together a successful relationship.  When you're dating the little things don't often bother you because you're not around the other person long enough to let those things bother you, but in a relationship those little things get amplified big time and it usually doesn't take long before you identify all the little things that your partner does that tick you off.Fifth: you have different values and priorities.  There was this time in my life where I kind of thought that I could make anything work.  I call this the "Catcher in the Rye" syndrome because we look at the world like Holden Caulfield and tend to think that we can make things turn out the way that we'd like them to.  Idealism is a dangerous thing.  We've got to be realistic.  For instance, I once dated a Republican(!)  and I was absolutely convinced that politics weren't going to divide us but then there was an election and we were at each other's throats.  We had a lot in common and I was able to check off a lot of boxes with her, but the constant blaming of the poor for the plights of the "job creators" just drove me over the edge.Sixth: you have different personalities.  This one isn't a deal-breaker, but it certainly can be.  It's ruined enough of my relationships and I therefore think it's important enough to mention.  Extroverts can be really annoying especially if they try and convert you to their cause.  I dated this one woman who wanted to go out every night of the week and she didn't particularly care where.  I enjoyed spending time with her, but at the same time I need my space as I think everyone does in a relationship, so that obviously didn't last.  However of all the things that people put up with I see this one happening the most frequently.  My parents suffer from this for instance.  They've been married for thirty-one years.Seventh: some people are too clingy.  You know who you are.  I dated one woman who needed to know everything that happened in my day down to what I ate for breakfast in the morning.  One day she asked me to specifically describe the ingredients that went into the making of my omelette.  I tried not to let this bother me because our personalities were so close together and we had so many shared interests.  We're still good friends, but if she brings up breakfast she seems to know that just bringing it up frustrates me.  She still wants to know and I still tell her, but if she starts asking for details I have to tell her that I'm not going to do go through a list of everything I did in my day.Eighth: different visions for the future.  My plan for the future could go one of two ways, both of which I'm fine with.  I could see myself writing full time and living on the west coast or teaching full time and living wherever.  The fact that I don't have a one size fits all idea of the future is enough to frustrate some women who already know when they want to have kids and where said kids will go to school etc.  Needless to say this sets up a barrier that is difficult to overcome.  I like to have options, but I know plenty of people who don't.  I've met women who don't want to have kids.  Sometimes that's okay, sometimes it's not.  I'm not sure if I want to have kids so I like the woman I'm dating to at least have an open mind about it.  Too much one way or the other can cause there to be too much distance between what we want individually and what we want for each other.Ninth: attachment or non-attachment to material goods.  Some people need to have the latest iPhone the day it comes out.  I don't understand that line of thinking, but there are situations in which I'll accept it.  But if the person I'm dating places too much value on material goods then it's probably not going to work out between us because I live a relatively simple life and am happy living a relatively simple life.  Adding a lot of things to my life creates unnecessary clutter and I don't need more things to think about and worry about.  At the same time I'm not willing to live in a van, that's something that is just not in the cards for me.Tenth: different worldviews.  Somebody asked me the other day: "why can't you be happy all the time?"  My answer was relatively simple: depression.  But it's not so simple for everyone.  Not everyone has been diagnosed with depression (although nearly one in four have.)  We all have a unique way of looking at the world and we look at the world from different vantage points.  For instance, I grew up in a middle class family in a middle class neighborhood.  I'm the product of public schools, I've lived in the same relative area my entire life.  If I'm dating someone who grew up poor this can lead to problems.  For starters studies have shown that class mobility can be dependent on who your parents are and how they grew up.  Different people have different experiences that goes without saying.  This also has to do with values and just personal preferences as well though.  Some people place an enormous value on "people watching" something that I've never put a lot of value on.  People behave in the manner they do for any number of reasons, many of which we'll never understand.  Worldview and values are usually interconnected.The Wildcard: (s)he doesn't like to do x, y, or z.  I love movies.  I've always loved movies.  I can't see myself being with someone who doesn't love movies.  Being able to whisper to them: "hey doesn't that remind you of that scene from x movie?" is very important to me.  Other people have different dealbreakers like not liking pets or disliking potential in-laws.  Whatever it is there will always be a drawback to each person you develop a relationship with and they cannot always be overcome.  All in all: Who we love is the single most important decision we make in our lives.  I think it only makes sense to take as much time as you need to make the right decision.  At the same time, making excuses for every little thing that someone does that you wouldn't do isn't always an acceptable reason for being single.  If the reasons that you give for being single are reasons that you have been unable to find a life partner then I would like to reiterate that you're not giving a reason you're giving an excuse.  Some people say: "well, I just like being single" and that's okay if that's the real reason that you're single.  But there are a lot of people who make excuses for being single when they'd like to be in a relationship of some kind and that's not the same thing as enjoying being single.  I'd like to be in a relationship, but I'm not for the reasons stated above.  It's not that I enjoy being single, it's that what I'm looking for in a woman probably just doesn't exist.  Whether or not I'm okay with that only time will tell.

She stopped wishing him before exams and interviews. She never told bad about him to any other girls.finally she stopped speaking with him.He got depressed, cried in midnight, ignored studies, started being like idiot but never started to hate her. He lost believe in love and relationships.They become strangers to each other, He started to study hard .He found his parents and career is important than anything else. Even the last day of college they never spoke to each other . he found the difference between love and like. After college He got job.There after he never believed anyone blindly, He decided to avoid getting into relationship again unless it will end in marriage, because he knows how it hurts each other, so he decided to be single.If he/she is trying to remain single does not mean he/she did not got relationship, maybe he/she is waiting for the right one.Thanks for reading,Ranjith
I have dated a few men over the years and realized it’s better for me to be single. Well, I can only speak for myself and what I have learnt is am not good with confrontations and that is a big problem when you are in a relationship. A few reasons why I am single.My friends say that I have set the bar too high and that is why I don’t find anyone and I should learn to compromise. But To what extent. I feel it’s better to be very picky than date the wrong person. (Lesson learnt the hard way)Unfortunately, the few who pass my standards do not seem to think that I meet theirs!I am registered in a matrimony site as my family insist that I should put some effort in finding a guy. But the only effort I put in is to decline the proposals that come my way.I'm a wrong judge of people and I am super lazy. I get a proposal and I am supposed to talk to this guy. I am bad at making small talk. I don’t like to talk for long hours when I am in office, I don’t like to talk when I am watching my favorite serial on TV (Usually its one hour of comedy (Big Bang Theory/2 and a half men). And i have had guys tell me to decide which is more important TV or finding a life partner. And yes, i always chose TV.I don't make much of an effort to meet people. I rather give excuse than go out and meet. I just don’t find the need to get ready and waste my makeup and ironed clothes from my cupboard just to come back disappointed. I have already made up my mind.I am working most part of the day (hardly meet anyone at work), I spend my free time visiting NGO’s. Never a place to meet prospective guys.I'm an introvert (when it comes to things like this). I will not make the first move because the last thing i want is to be rejected. I won’t even say Hello to a guy unless he says it first.And the last but not the least, I have met this guy (my prince charming) who doesn’t even know I exist and I am hopeful someday he will notice me (though we live in different states). May be this is just another excuse for me to stay single. (read my blog for more about this)I found this answer by another person and I found it so true, so am taking the liberty of quoting it here:“Reasons that I might not be entirely to blame for are:Now that I'm getting uhh older, there are fewer single men my age around.Men, in general, are not looking for a serious relationship?Everyone's so busy these days!”

No, I believe the people who are attached to others are weak.I was in class 8th and I had a crush on one of my classmates, After facing rejection from her I felt heartbroken and had lost all of my confidence.There was this girl who lived near my house, we soon became friends. She was of my age and she was quite friendly. When she came to know about how that girl had rejected me, she consoled me and said”It’s her loss and you’ll find someone way better.” I felt really glad somebody understood me and we soon became best buds and shared everything.We would usually stay late in the park and stargaze for hours.We didn’t realize when our friendship grew into something stronger , maybe love. But neither one of us could actually figure it out.But, these things don’t last, one day she came to me, almost weeping. Her father had been transferred to Allahabad. I also found myself , wiping my tears. I asked her” Is there anyway we can make this work? We don’t have phones and parents won’t understand.” She said, “My Nani lives here, I’ll be here every summer and winter break.”By that time our studies for 9th class were about to begin and this seemed the only possible way.Time went by and the summer break commenced, but she didn’t come. One day I gathered up courage and asked the neighbours about it, saying that she had borrowed something.This is when I came to know that she had died of hepatitis a week ago.My whole world fell apart and I fucked up my academics, sports and physique that year. I didn’t tell this too anyone as I don’t want the pity of others, and because it’s too painful. People don’t understand how much pain you have to go through when you loose someone, around whom your whole life revolves.It’s been many years since then, I’m currently in my sophomore year of college.I still look upto the stars but now I feel you’re better single as you can’t get hurt this way.

Not even once!Well, maybe i’ve felt a little out of place when I go to the movies alone, and having others with their spouse doing ‘their stuff’… but i’ve not had the chance to regret it one bit.While I know it’s much better to be with someone, because iron sharpens iron… i enjoy being single. I can give you like 50 reasons, but:I have goals already…. having to add someone is too much work.My resources would be at stake… no +1, equals more food for me.I can be more productive with my time.I don’t have to stress with more details, like, ‘what she wore today, why she said what she said like 12 hours ago’, and all those mind games we can never win.I can go wherever i want, with little or no concern about having to dress to impress.No pressure with future questions like ,’ What are we?’ or ‘Will you stop loving me?’No challenge with watching what she wants for the sake of being ‘boyfriend material’…. i can’t handle that.No problems with trying to impress her over and over again… while being her boyfriend.No problems with dates… No I don’t remember the anniversary of your grandma’s sister’s dog’s death.I can put all my effort on myself, and improve myself much better.And many others.I know these are not valid reasons to be single. It’s more profitable to have someone to improve with….But I’ve never regretted it, for once!
If you have always been single, do you regret it?
No it gives me the confidence to live life on my own terms ..im not answerable to anyone.. don't need to justify my actions n choices.. im not possessed by or obsessed with someone .no drama..no breaking my head for hours on the phone . im free n independence is a required trait .. im detached and in the end its you for yourself ..others may walk on your path with you… but no one can walk it for you I have few good friends to share my space n life with.. and the rest with my mother ..being single is actually a realisation that u don't really need too many people to fend for yourself and survive.. it gives you independence and stability.. n the self sufficiency remains with you even when your so called boyfriend or husband or whatever leaves you.i have had my fair share of hookups n fun but im too narcissistic to let someone else be the centre of my universe..also I feel I need to b worthy of for someone to respect and trust me.. and im not there yet.. im in the making of myself.. to be deemed worthy of some individuals respect.. so it is more important to work on yourself first… no regrets ..I can say with my head and standards held high.. ofcourse I can make exceptions if the guy looks like Nick Bateman or Brad Pitt.. ;) but that's a different story

I've been in love twice in my life. Understanding the meaning of true love with one of those relationships. I've also been in relationships that I regretted entering on day one, as I knew it wouldnt work. After finding love that's deep, lasting and meaningful and then try to replicate prior feelings within other relationships, I've learned to stay single until I find another person that lights my soul on fire once more. Is there a possibility that I'll be single forever? Yes. And I'm ok with that. I'd rather be single than be with a person that's wrong for me, or that doesnt ignite my spirit. You can't really regret being alone if there isn't a partner for you to walk the path of life with.

I have many friends who are single and perfectly happy. There are many who are very unhappy with their life.The whole issue depends on what you want from life. Many due to their circumstances, family problems, cruelty by partners of their siblings, not interested to share their personal issues, take a decision to remain single. Many sacrifice their entire life for the benefit of family and welfare of parents.There is a friend of mine who says that there is plenty of milk available, then why buy a cow? I am not agreeing with him.I am a happily married man touching half century.Many wants no responsibility of running a family. They lead a care free life with no encumbrances.
If you have always been single, do you regret it?
I have been single for a year now and I don’t regret it at all.My previous relationship was toxic for the both of us, and I ended it.I only got better as a person and so did she, so there is nothing to regret.

I can't say, but I can tell you something I KNOW for a fact.You will regret being married to the wrong person if you rush into a marriage, "just to be married"Contrarily to what a lot of people will tell you, you don't have a "married by" date.  If you are worried you aren't meeting enough people, maybe ou should get out more and take up some hobbies that you enjoy for their own sake but offer the opportunity to meet and interact with more people.Do ge out and be social, make more friends, get more in touch with and develop your love of self.  Live your life to the fullest but don't stress about being married by X date.  The more you are having positive interactions with a variety of like minded people, the higher your chance of hitting it off with someone but don't push it or youll seem needy.  If your not interested in marrying anyone, then likely you've just never met the one who makes you reconsider.  Be open to relationships when they come but again don't worry about it.  If you're single and happy, content, then its not an issue.  I would suggest trying to develop as many good friendships as possible still though so that when you get older you will have close friends and not feel lonely.Everyone has different social needs.  Don't burn bridges but don't worry if our own don't necessarily follow the social "norm"

Someone saw a man wearing his wedding ring on is middle finger…”Sir”, he said, “you are wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger”… “Yes”, the man replied, “I married the wrong woman!”That, of course, can go both ways… “I married the wrong man, or in our new world, “the wrong partner”.In my younger years, if you not married by a certain age, something was wrong with you. I was coerced into getting married to a woman I knew in my heart was not the right fit for me. She would have been a perfect fit for someone else, but I could feel in my gut that it would be a rocky road ahead. She had an affair, our first year of marriage and while I tried to keep my wedding vows of “better or worse”, it just got worse and twenty-years later, as my health started to deteriorate from the stress I separated and later filed for divorce.Today, the odds are against you that your marriage will survive for the long-term. If you are happy in your life and enjoy just hanging out with friends with the occasionally added benefits, then keep doing what you are doing with no guilt. You get to use your money and your time to your bidding without anyone else dictating your life. One billionaire wrote, when discussing financial decisions…”if floats, flies, or f…s…then rent it!” Somewhat crude, but perhaps accurate…
Do you regret never getting married?
I've written about this in another answer but I am adding more! I don't know if I'll ever get married but I was supposed to be getting married in December, but I called it off. I loved him and I trusted him more than any single person on the planet. I suspected things, and I know for a fact that I am a very intuitive person, but he always denied everything I would try to bring up and solve. He had to go away for a while… we have a daughter together so he's only seen her twice since the last month. He told me he didn't want to be with me because he needs to focus on himself but he had also spoken about a girl that he'd met 'at this place' that sounded… out of the ordinary for him. I knew what was happening but I didn't want to believe it. He would never do that to me right?It turns out that I ran into a mutual friend whilst out and about whilst my now ex was at his house with our daughter so he could see her before going back. This mutual friend told me that my now ex is seeing a girl 'at this place' and added that my ex is not only into women… which I also knew but didn't want to admit to myself. He refuses to confirm nor deny until I tell him who it was that told me this and got in his car and left. I told him if he loved or even cared about me in the slightest he'd be honest with me, and didn't. I know he would've said no if it weren't true. He ended it with me to work on himself but is now dating a girl with a whole lot of her own issues, and couldn't even inform me. Our rule was if one of us started seeing someone we'd let each other know also because she share a daughter and want to know who the newcomer is in her life. I asked him if her name was… the girl he'd mantioned before, and I saw the look in his eye and I knew. I had a melt down. I cried, I sobbed, I begged just for an answer and he refused. My heart feels like it's torn into a million pieces, but imagine I had married him and then years down the line, find out he isn't the person I thought he was.So in my case, I do not regret not getting married.
Will I regret not getting married ?
How can a stranger who doesn't know you answer this? I don't even think your best friend can answer this. I don't even think you can answer this until you are quite old and on your deathbed, unless of course you regret it much earlier.Just live your life and if you don't get married, you'll find out, and if you do get married, then you won't.

Will I regret not getting married ?
I have read back cover of a book written by French writer (I don’t remember his name). The main idea of his book was that “the biggest success someone can achieve is not to be rich, famous, powerful, but to own a good family”. He was comitted suicide in a hotel room at approximately his seventies. He also was an unmarried writter.I think most elderly unmarried people feel regret at the end of their life. Because having a family, children is a source of joy. Unmarried people lost such an opportunity and there is no way to turn back again.Also all living creatures naturally need reproduction.If you think that I will live or hang out with diferent people in different periods of my life, most probably, especially if you are a woman, there will be no one with you in your hour of need. You will be capitalised in your prime, and then you be left to your fate at least sensually.Think again.
Will I regret not getting married ?
You may not regret getting married. But only if you're not marrying the right person. I am a firm believer that when you get married you should be getting married to someone that you want to be with till the day you die. And that means well until your 93 even if you make it 200. Marriage is supposed to be about committing and spending your life with someone that you love so much you could never imagine going a day without them. So unless you feel that type of bond and relationship and dedication to someone it's better not to get married. A really strong marriage is probably one of the best things you can ever experience in your life. But it only works if you meet someone that you literally feel you can't live without. It also makes it easier when you have such a strong bond to weather the ups and downs of a marriage. Everything will marriage will have its good times and its bad times. But what gets people through the bad times is the love that they have for the other person and the willingness to work out whatever issues have come up because you value them and love them so much.
Do you regret never getting married?
Yes! I was very immeture! My siblings were all much older than me, & did not play with me! No neighbor kids! No school kids came home with me! I grew up entirely alone! My father was in the hospital, & my mother worked to support us! Got my first real job at age 27, & had my first real date! Nice girl who tried to put some moves on me, but I was too ignorant to recognize her signals, so she moved on! Another girl waited 13 years for me to return home, & died 2 weeks before I was going to propose to her! I went on to live 50 years without a wife, kids, Or sex! I have major regrets! When I was 12 YO, an 11 YO girl offered to have sex with me- I was SCHOCKED, that someone so young would consider having sex, & declined! I have often wondered, if I had accepted her offer, would it have made a major improvement in my life! Bless You, Betty! Bill
Do you regret never marrying?
Never, not even for an instant. My partner and I have lived together for almost 33 years now and raised two, now grown up, sons. We still love each other very much and plan to spend the rest of our lives together.Why do we need the church and the state to tell us we're allowed to do all this?Most of our friends who got married are now divorced or separated. Most of our children's classmates were married - and divorced. Ours was the only intact partnership in either of our childrens’ high school classes - for seven years running!Marriage … it’s just a piece of paper folks. Commitment? That's quite a different thing.
Do you regret not getting married?
‘Do you regret not getting married? ‘To me personally, just the opposite, I regret getting married, three times. All my marriages ended up with divorces, and ALL three times, in various degrees, is because my former spouse stole from me, lied to me, cheated on me, and then ran off with another man. I have become very cynical about this whole marriage institution.

What is it like to grow old and never be married?
Mine is a completely different answer, but it's truthful am 69 and have never been married, not really even close to it. As a girl, I never dreamed of romance and weddings. I mostly had comfortable friendships with boys and young men and did little dating. Even my younger sister didn't marry until she was 30. My parents had a wonderful, loving 60-year union so I guess they set the bar pretty high for the four of us children.                                                                      In my early 20s, from university, I went with one man for several years and we lived together for some months of that time. I was mostly trying to discover what this "love business" was all about and if it was for me. The relationship never felt solid enough to me to base my life on, so when he drunkenly proposed to me one night, I told him we would talk about it in the morning. The subject never came up again. I decided, after 7 (mostly) unhappy years to move on with my life. I also vowed to find out if men and women could really learn to trust one another and build genuine intimacy on that. Since that time, I've had many wonderful friendships with men, without manipulative games or tension. I can honestly say I've never spent time and effort to find a life mate.In my 30s I met and joined a spiritual group that practiced celibacy before marriage. Although I was matched with a man in the group, he left before I really got to know him at all. Once again, I moved on in my life. Instead of waiting around for happiness to come to me, I went for adventure. Fortunately, I had an opportunity to move to Moscow, just as the Soviet Union was collapsing and I went for it. Now, for the last 22 years, I've been an expat teaching English in Russia surrounded by friends and students of several generations. It's been interesting, challenging and rewarding. I can honestly say I didn't miss a private social life at all.That said, I would say that I'm finally "ready" for marriage and want to make that the next adventure in my life when I move back to the U.S.early next year. I feel I've had so many rich life experiences and now would love to have someone to share them with. I've always been somewhat domestic, but I'm eager now to build a nest to grow old in with a husband. I understand that I/we may only have 5-15 years to enjoy the fruits of married life, with health and lifespan issues looming at the age of 70. But, then again, a lot of the stressors (career and children) of younger married couples will not dominate our time and decisions. Looking back, I guess I was fearful of settling down with a small-minded person who might try to hold me back from growing or living my life fully. Now that I've really shown what I can accomplish (in a foreign country, no less), those anxieties are completely melted away. I certainly know who I am and what I have to offer. I've also seen enough of life and worked with thousands of people so I've gained a pretty good understanding of interpersonal interaction and learned to be flexible. I also know it won't be easy going from "me" to "we", but then, nothing really worthwhile is. I'm approaching marriage with a fresh enthusiasm that few people my age do, and I'm not sorry I waited first to really mature. I guess you could call me a REALLY LATE BLOOMER.---It's now the summer of 2015. After returning to the U.S. from Russia in Dec, 2014, I continued to meet eligible men online. I've now met a wonderful man, 12 years my junior, a retired widower, and have moved to his home in Montgomery, Alabama to prepare for our marriage in a few months. - Erin

Why didn't Isaac Newton get married?
I'm in my mid-40s. I don't see it as different from the rest of my earlier life. You go through the same routine each day, one day at a time. I have my projects, which hold intense interest for me. I feel like I have a mission in life, and I've had it since I was a teenager. That is the pursuit with which I struggle. I get joy and some pain out of that. I love learning, and I have sometimes wondered if the reason I haven't gotten married is that I'm more in love with my work than I am with the idea of being married. On the other hand, I certainly wouldn't mind being with a woman who shared a compatible pursuit with mine, and we could share that love of learning. I just haven't found her yet.In my earlier years I dealt with the judgment that some thought I might be gay. Some wondered, looking as I did, and perhaps being who I was, "How is it possible" that I wasn't married, or at least "with someone." I was mystified at the wonder. I never found it that hard to stay single. I’d shrug, and say, "Just being myself." Sasha Cagan some years back came out with this idea of the Quirkyalone. I've thought that sounds quite a bit like me.There were stretches of time where I wondered if there was something wrong with me, especially after I saw a few of my friends get married, and start having children. I wasn't even dating. It all happened around the same time, in my late 20's/early 30's. Their age was similar. The idea started creeping up on me that my chance of getting married and having children (which has seemed like a nice idea) was passing me by. I got sad about being alone sometimes, though it passed. It wasn't until I got into my forties that it dawned on me that my suspicions about myself were all wrong. The reason I haven't gotten married is I haven't met a woman who is available, and who impresses/inspires me. Most of the women I’d consider were already in other relationships/married. So they were "off the market," as far as I was concerned. While I'd be drawn to others, I didn't feel comfortable just being drawn because of their attractiveness. I wanted to get a sense of the real person, and that's where it's ended. I realize quickly that we're going in different directions.There was a point when I reached 40 where I figured if it hadn't happened by then, it was never going to happen, and I needed to just get used to it. I'm not willing to say never, but the idea that it may never happen is a thought that's been with me since my late 20's.Looking back on my conceptions of this, I've also wondered whether I ever wanted a relationship for the right reasons. Maybe it was just a physical need. I've since heard that many men who get married do so because creating a family is their primary goal in life. I've never felt that way. I've desired that, but my primary goal in life--my first love, you could say--has always been something else. I've always suspected, though, that if I met a woman who I wanted to marry that a lot of that would change--at least for a while.I have sometimes thought that I've been fortunate that I haven't gotten married and started a family, because if I had, there is no way financially I would be able to pursue the kind of work (projects) I've been doing. Though, one never knows.
I love it when people ASSUME that getting married earlier in life will always last into old age and as a result that they will always have a companion and not ever feel lonely or unhappy.Nowadays we haveA divorce rate currently hovering at around 55% in this country (USA), a resurgence of "Feminism" and “gender confusion”.A new generation of women (and some retired ones) who are choosing to either never get married or never marry again.A generation of men reaching middle age and walking out on their marriage while sometimes “trading up for a younger model”.A generation of men choosing to remain bachelors for life—fearing a divorce would leave them penniless and without access to kids (if they even choose to have kids) giving rise to the MGTOW (men going their own way) movement.An increase in homosexuality (most don’t marry even when it became legal), Tran-sexuality and everything else in between.A generation of men and women who may want to get married someday but feel stuck due to social anxiety, unable to relate to the opposite sex or even get the courage to ask anyone out.A generation of men who are not making as much money as their fathers/grandfathers did and thus feel that they wouldn’t have much to offer a woman by way of financial security.A generation of old people who are still married into their 60′s, 70′s, 80’s absolutely lonely and miserable in their 30–50+ year marriage.Given all these conditions its shocking that there are still people out their who believe that marrying in the younger years will somehow guarantee everlasting happiness, fulfillment and bond to their spouse well into their old age.For most people life doesn't end their 60′s and certainly doesn’t have to be less fulfilling simply because they are single. There are literally TONS of things people can do in their 60′s thru 90′s to not feel "lonely". Working, volunteering, traveling, attending social clubs, chess club, dancing, card games etc. —the list is quite long and only shortened by the health status of the senior.Not to mention that marriage in old age is not necessarily “bliss” while being single is not necessarily “miserable and lonely”. My grandparents are a perfect example of this—My grandfather abandoned my grandma in her early 60's, then he remarried at 65 and lived with his second wife until his death in his 90's. His second wife was almost never around for him and neither were his kids (especially since he lived far from them). Definitely NOT a happy and fulfilling marriage or life.Grandma, on the other hand, remained single and lead a full active work and social life well into her old age until the last 6 years of her life where she had to slow down and let one of her daughters and a caregiver help her out at home. She ended up much better off than grandpa and died peacefully in her sleep.Three of my aunts who entered their 60s being single, without children, still had active lives until they passed in their late 60s-70's. I have another aunt who is divorced in her 70's and still very active socially. She’s “too busy” to be lonely.My former grandmother in-law lost her husband to illness when she was in her late 50′s. She CHOSE not to remarry (though she dated a few times on and off) and lived a fulfilling and active social life into her 90s- parties, fundraising, working out, swimming, crafts, church pot luck etc. There was always something going on in her house-several times a week. I have no idea where she had the energy to do everything she did, especially since she wasn't the picture of "perfect health".My former step-mother in law who was 62 when she was abandoned by her husband for a "younger model" wants NOTHING to do with re-marrying. She too doesn't have children. Yet she leads a very active social life now in her late 60′s she does jazzercise, is a freelance caregiver and organizer, attends church services and is involved in other community activities. Last I heard she had gotten a roommate/friend, another single senior lady and together they have a blast.My single and former Mother in law is now in her 70's and moving from frigid temp state to sunny warm state and closer to one of her kids. Her other children want nothing to do with taking care of their mother (that happens alot-you cant count on adult kids in your old age) who is getting over an illness. She is still active but realizes she will need help so she is planning on getting a part-time caregiver/housekeeper as she becomes less able to do things around the house. She is still socially active.My point- THERE ARE A LOT of single baby boomers in their late 50′s, 60′s, 70′s and 80's and there will be a lot more. People who never got married, who are divorced or who are widows and widowers.Life does not guarantee you a spouse into your old age, so if you are counting on someone else to make you "happy" or "less lonely" STOP. Start getting used to doing things for yourself and know that life can be amazing even without a spouse.Some people that face depression in their old age do so because they suddenly find themselves alone after decades of counting on someone else to make them happy instead of finding fulfillment in work, activities, classes, spiritual development and socializing with others. So when their spouse dies or leaves them they become emotionally lost-not knowing what to do, where to go or how to find happiness without a spouse by their side.Finally, there’s the question/concerns of health issues in old age. Sometimes that is a valid excuse to hide from the world, often times it is not.Every single one of my family members starting in their 60s had health issues--often serious--heart, diabetes, spinal degeneration/pain, high blood pressure etc. and every single one worked through pain and health problems, managed to remain socially and physically active.The more sedentary you are as you grow older, the bigger the health problems. That is what my 75 year old half blind, half deaf, heart diseased, diabetic mother told me. She doesn't stop and she goes out EVERY DAY to get some sun and also do activities—library, crafts, classes, exercise (walking), shopping etc. doing these things have kept her diabetes and heart condition under control.So stop worrying about tomorrow, whether or not you’ll get married, whether or not you’ll have kids and live your life!
I am 'over forty' and never married and I don't see it ever happening.When I was younger, I longed to find The One. I was engaged several times and in numerous relationships. I lived with a couple of guys early on but  I had a BAAAD break-up when my youngest was about 2 and I swore I would never let another adult into a position of power within our household. As such, my kids have grown up relating  to my companions only as friends of the family with no say in how their lives were conducted. This has been an obstacle in my relationships - my partners have felt like outsiders looking into the magic circle of my family - but I don't regret it. I was lonely for a lot of years, but I have come to believe that much of that was about sex. While we are still fertile, biology lashes us to find a mate and make more babies. Since my hormones have begun to wind down, I find I have no drive to find a companion. I don't miss sleeping with someone. I don't miss arguing with someone. I don't miss having to get used to someone who eats with their mouth open or farts with abandon. I, on the other hand, greatly enjoy the fact that I may eat with my mouth open and fart whenever the muse moves me. I do miss having breakfast in a little open air cafe by the ocean and reading the papers on Sunday morning and having someone to complain to about the government. I do miss, occasionally, when something really good or really bad happens, sharing it with someone really intimate. I have great friends - but let's face it, the events of my life are just news to them. When you are married, the events of your life are also the events of your partner's life. I have said for quite a long time now that I believe my primary relationship is with art. I have a relationship with writing and music that fluctuates in the same way my friends' and relatives' marriages seem to do; sometimes I hate my creativity and feel smothered by it, I want to leave it but I can't, I feel trapped by my gifts, other times, I love it and I can't spend enough time with it, I feel in love with my projects, I feel nurtured by them, I never feel alone when my creative relationship with myself is in good shape. But then, there are long periods of time when I don't 'put in' to the relationship and as a result, I don't get anything out of it; it gets stale and old and I wonder if that's all there is. But then something will happen, some new idea will take hold of me and I fall in love with my own creativity all over again. I should mention that my kids fill the very human need for strong love bonds in my life. I don't think I could enjoy my singledom nearly as much if I didn't have great relationships with them. I expect to grow old and never be married. It suits me.

Should you marry a guy who never had a girlfriend?
There is a saying "One can love all women or one woman, but not both".I chose the first, and I made the right choice.Of course you must not make false assumptions.I have never been married, nor unlucky in love.I have lady friends from nearly sixty years ago.I have men friends in their late 70-80's who fall madly in love; one married the girl he was at college with and was a great grandmother when he proposed.One became an expert dancer in his 80s having never danced before in his life, to win the heart of a lady.I have a lady friend in her 70's who spends much time online dating, and scores better than most women half her age.To some extent the term 'Grow old' can mean several things.Do you mean physically old where you are dependent on others for your care.Do you mean mentally old where you no longer participate in social events.Do you mean spiritually old where you have beliefs and a lifestyle out of keeping with younger generations.Of perhaps even fashionably old where you are seen as an anachronism.In regard to being married, then not having been married means that one is not part of the married scene. This is quite different for men an women. When a man gets married, in most cases he drops his social life. He may have a friend or two, but he will rely mainly on his wife to organise events for family and friends. Married men find it very difficult to make new friends, which is why their work is so important to them. Women tend to have friends from family and neighbours so even in old age they can get some support in times of stress.Again, men make less effort to retain contact - even with their own children - as they get older.Old unmarried man will generally keep up with his 'mates' from work or hobbies.An old unmarried man will generally be self-sufficient in being able to look after himself, but may commonly become quite untidy without a lady to either care or scold him into being more presentable.My experience is that men who get married late in life tend to benefit the most.This extends to men who do not get married but take a partner late in life. This is probably because as we get older we realise that people who need each other have a better relationship than those that love each other. And those that care for each other have a better relationship than those that need each other.
52, and I share my home with my Mother, and my sister, my son is grown and moved on, long time ago. I have a garden, a comfortable home, a nice ride, and I am fine. Many yrs ago, I married a young fellow with Ringling Brothers Circus, lasted 2 weeks. I doubt if I ever walk that walk again, I am comfortable, meaning OLD, older hair, body, face.. (BODY).. yeah. (chuckle) It’s OK! it’s OK…. I cant imagine trying to get used to a man in my life now,, the only man that was ever really in my life,, was my Father,, and he has been gone a long long time.. Sometimes it’s sad,, but I don't have to go through the good-byes at the end of a 50 yr marriage, I don’t have to worry about him getting sick, and me having to do things I never had to do before,, (like mow or snow blow) I already do those. No,, it’s ok….. it’s ok.
Before integrating the duo, the musician must rehearse alone.(Quoted from my book:) In fact, for our sages, as we have seen, human love is the touchstone of divine love. Hence, throughout the entire heroic process (and this process may last several lives), the predestined “duo” should coincide if not always, then often. The Two will then come together to play that melody that they rehearsed by themselves. After all, that’s why we come into this world: to rehearse, to put our soul to the test in order to polish it, to clean it of impurities. Just like a musician hones his technique during rehearsals. Practice makes perfect. Reincarnations are as vital for the soul as daily physical contact with his instrument is for the musician. We cannot clean the impurities off our soul all the way up from Heaven, just as a musician cannot perfect his technique just by studying musical theory. Theory is the necessary foundation, but it’s useless if he does not translate that theory into practice. And that takes time and effort. In the case of a musical duo, perfecting their technique is vital, for the musicians’ harmony on stage depends on it. The more refined their individual technique is, the tighter they will sound, and the less dissonant will their performance of that joint melody be, that melody of which each one of them plays half the notes, so to speak. There will come a moment, after many intense rehearsals, when that double melody will sound as if it’s being played by one musician only, which is what this is all about. And well, Blanca, the same is applicable to predestined lovers, whose ultimate objective –unification- also depends on the refinement of their souls: the more refined they are, the more refined and true their love will be. And true love is the creator of unification.
I was asked to marry when I was 16. I was headed to college after high school and didn't want to be a married college student so I declined. I have had boyfriends most of my life, but none has ever wanted to marry me. Mostly because they had been married and had a bad experience I think. I have lived with a few men too. Mostly I don't like not being able to use the word "husband" I call my mate now, (17 years) "my fella" Ick, I hate it, but can't come up with anything better. I do think of him as my mate. I think of him and his son as my family. Secondly I think about the things that people get out of even bad marriages like part of the persons social security and pension. I'll never have that. I hear people say it's overrated but I am sad that I have never been married.Thank you for your interest.
Getting married doesn’t mean happiness, or that you’ll go into your 70’s and beyond with company or people that actually do care about you.Know of so many people who married and divorced, and many more married and secretly feel dead and bored.Having children doesn’t mean that they will care for you either when old and sick. No, it doesn’t. I witnessed the opposite more often.Bottom line-live the life you want and do what you truly find that brings you joy. We’re all alone in the end.

I'm 52, never married and from the time I remember I didn't like or want kids.  I wouldn't trade my life for the drudgery and negative drama of a marriage.

Have you ever regretted never marrying?
It is human nature to want what we do not have. Those who married and had children also regret their choices. "Why didn't I stay single and free!" A person who wishes they had done the opposite is viewing the other choice as perfect --my child would have been perfect, or I would have jet-setted all over the world if I didn't have kids and a family to tie me down. They do not imagine that their child might have been a defiant, hateful, drug-addicted high school dropout. Or imagine that the carefree single life might have left them dating pilots who fork over money for abortions like coffee money. Yes, everyone wishes for the perfect life not chosen, including single childless women in their fifties.
I have to be anonymous as I'm not sure how my comments will come across my friends who are on this site.I’m very happy to have made the choices of not getting married and not having kids.As a result, I’m well-traveled, well-read and have many good friends. I know and love myself. I’m successful in my career and generally healthy. I’m able to give time and money to things I’m passionate about.I don’t think these can all be possible in one lifetime if I got married and have kids.

Human psychology is such that we want what we don't have and don't appreciate what we do have. For example, I had a childhood dream of having a fair enough internet connection and playing games on websites like Cartoon Network or Pogo. I wanted it very badly back then. I used to request my elder brother to take me to cyber cafes to titillate myself with these websites and once in a while, he would agree to take me and I would fool around on the internet. But then I got a broadband connection at home and slowly, this fascination began to wear out. I realized that there's nothing more special in it than, say, sitting in a comfortable chair and reading Sherlock Holmes. Needless to say, now I don't even visit those sites at all which were my dreams a few years ago. Same goes for wanting toys. Same goes for the desire for an iPhone. Same goes for needing a partner. Though, it's comforting in the beginning to have someone caring for you but then again, I believe our psychology kicks in and the fascination wears out eventually. People generally don't find their partner that scintillating after 3 to 5 years of marriage, so far as I have observed.You wrote, "You don't feel it now, but when you're older and your siblings are busy with their own family, you'll be lonely." Now that's not necessarily going to be true. Rather than attaching yourself to a person, you could keep yourself engaged in a pursuit, i.e. a goal. You could learn mountaineering, scuba diving, watch online lectures on history, physics, French Revolution, programming, attend dance and music classes, read excellent literature classics or do whatever interests you (which you otherwise wouldn't have much time to do, if you had family or kids). That way, you'd be engaged in worthy activities and won't feel lonely. Loneliness is, after all, a state of mind. You can even feel lonely if you're sitting in a crowd, if you catch my drift.

Do you regret not getting married and being single?
Never.. I am happy on my own! I love myself fully and i dont need another half to complete me and rather want someone as a whole! This Era is filled with the hype of being in relationship and there are supporting dating sites and social platforms where u encounter ample of profiles suggesting u a partner to fill the so called "void".. thats for those who are lonely and cant enjoy life! I have been on my own since years and mostly  independent along with friends and family to love and support me through thick and thin.. my happiness solely depends on me In my opinionNobody can love u more than You coz You understand yourself better than anyone !!
She is probably right from a very practical point. I am 28 as well, not ready to get married any time soon, I have a friend who is commitment phobic too and we really love each other (but don't want to get confess it, yes, we never spoke about it), so officially I am single. I don't regret any of it but, some how (weak moments you know) I feel the need of someone when nobody will be around. Parents wont live forever, my sister is already busy with her family. I don't get to meet my friends every weekend.Yes, to have somebody to spend your holidays (where you know he/she will be there no matter what) that would be nice. The feeling is nice. But the phobia of commitment kills the joy. So no regret! 
Ahh.. question seems to have perception of yours, your mom's, and on that your asking others that being single is regretful ?May be, what she is trying to say that you will miss few awsome moments of life by being single.I am not saying being single will ruin your life, or will take away joy etc. hell no! its freedom that you are enjoying, loving and wanting to live same way.however, if you see from her eyes, she saw you growing which is best part of life one can ever experience! to see cute sweet little kid entering in your world and making you say We from I!  when your hungry, probably you will go for maggie at home or pizza ordering, but its nothing as compared to mom's hand made paratha's full of love & ghee too ! ;) .you feel joy of presence in family when you have others in life as part of your family.to find friend in form of husband, to share your views, to get motivation from them when you yourself feel doubtful about what you doing!I personally feel, life is all about living with others, to share happiness, joy, to help each other.Nothing is perfect in life, relationships,people, nothing, but its commitment we show in it that makes us different, positive and strong and unique from others. your mom is telling you to see all this to experience all this in life.And last but not least, there is nothing called marrying wrong guy/girl.think 10000 times before jumping into it, but once your in, dont give it up so easily.cos if you say person is wrong, then mind you, you are wrong too since you selected him/her!Just a perception! do think about it ! afterall, we all need jaadu ki jhappi! :)

Have you ever regretted being married and not single?
No, I never regret being single.Being single is the best part of life since you are independent. After certain age for eg after 32-35 you need a partner to move forward in your life.Being single you can do anything you want, u never feel jealous also. You can do anything you want. When your workloads increases you needs someone to make you relax,to make you happy, to be with you entire your life, to support you and at last at your last stage of your life you need someone with whom you can spend time happily.
I am 30 yrs old and single. I do want to settle down at some point and almost did when I was 27. But for whatever reasons it didn't materialise. So not going in any further details, here is in nutshell my learning from life so far: Each one of us has a different journey in life. We are not in school or college anymore where everyone has a single goal with a timeline; pass the class the same year. Life is a much bigger and grander affair. Do things that make you happy right now. Pursue things you want to right now. If you don't feel like settling down then don't. Especially for a big decision like marriage, the worst thing you can do is to marry for the wrong reason! If ever you meet the one and feel like getting married then do! Else stay single. Whatever you decide to do, make sure you live a life true to yourself!
I am rather happily married for 32 years now and fully endorse your mother's view. If you are not committed to something, which requires you to remain unmarried for the time being, you are wasting your time. To remain unmarried is not an achievement, without some specific purpose. Marriage is not a burden, it is a social responsibility and it gives you everything in life-- meaning, purpose, fulfilment. So be serious about it, before it is too late.Turn a new leaf, start a new chapter of life and you will enjoy it, will be benefited by it. Best Wishes !
I'm 33 & single and for me, not really. That's not to say I don't get thoughts of wanting a life companion or a family, especially when seeing friends in moments of marital & familial bliss. But those thoughts are fleeting, and are readily countered with "Thank god I'm not in THAT relationship" when seeing friends in dysfunctional, manipulative and even abusive relationships.But more importantly, I'm a fairly spontaneous free spirit - and the idea of constantly checking in on where I'm going or what I'm doing seems stifling. On a similar note, I don't feel the need to be updated every time my S.O. wants to do their thing. So while I'm open to the idea of a relationship, it will likely be a paradoxical-sounding "let's be together... separately" one.And like others said, do what makes you happy; if you decide that you do want a significant other later in life, you can easily put yourself out there in search of one.
No, atleast not yet. What is there to regret? Tesla in his old age felt that he should have accepted the proposal s he had at his disposal of a potential life companion. May be a sense of rejection may stem out, a feeling of not being compatible with the construct of the world around us. And after that there is nothing to feel bad about. Our parents did their 'job' of raising kids to the level of self sustainance. Now they expect us to do the same which is not bad as we have a social fabric to maintain. There could be a regret like a cone of ice cream that you didn't try, and we the monkey see monkey do humans feels bad when we are not acting like the other monkey. So don't take a decision just because you feel that you'll regret not taking it. Take your time. Good luck

What are some reasons why people are single?
Let's make a checklist for all the essential things to get committed and the challenges in each step. (More suited for an average Indian guy)Interest in a relationship :- A lot of people are genuinely not interested in/aware of  a relationship up to some age. Deeply engrossed in higher studies , career , financial commitments etc . Heard of noble gases ? Yeah , they don't fucking bond with anything so easily because they are so complete and self absorbed.Time :- Okay , now you feel its time to start dating , but do you have time for that ? Are you in a job that sneaks into the nooks and corners of your life ? Is your course too demanding of your time ?Contacts :- Okay now you have interest and time , but where do you find girls ? The most common ways are school friends , college , workplace. Now some people could have studied in a gents school . College or workplace might have an unfairly skewed ratio of 1 girl per 50 guys e.g Reputed engineering colleges and Reputed Software MNCs ( Nothing misogynistic here , I am just giving my observation ) And just so you don't tell me about HR dept, Let me tell you something  "One simply doesn't mess with the HR Department".Expectations :- Okay , luckily you happen to know some girls you can reach out to. But do they meet your expectations ? You are so awesome (at least , that's what you think ) that most of the girls you know don't match your expectations in some way or the other. And you are too nice/decent to hit on random girls or send "fraandship requests" .Courage/Drive  :- Okay , you have finally narrowed down on a girl who matches everything you are looking for. What next ? Make romantic advances to her ! Did that just send a tingle down your spine ? Understandable ! Are you too lazy to initate ? Understandable .Skill :- Okay , now you have finally mustered some courage/drive and take a do or die approach . Good ! Now start talking . Sure , let's talk about .... mmm ... uhhh .. oh crap ! what will I talk about ? Availability :- Okay , you have the necessary skill and you are just too good at smooth talk. You initiate the conversation and become an instant hit. You connect so well , that she tells you about her boyfriend !! BAMM . You hit the wrong girl son !Friend zone :- Okay , she is not committed. You talk for hours , you get to know each other . But you know , she just thinks of you as a good friend. BAMM . You prepared Maths for a History exam dude !! Mutual Interest :- Okay , she doesn't friend zone you . But she rather does not want to get involved in relationships either ! She likes you but won't love you . Because her family is orthodox , about to be engaged , does not believe in relationships , different caste/religion etc.  BAMM . Dead End !!Commitment :- Okay , everything is fine. She is kinda falling for you . Mission Accomplished !! Now what ? Propose and get committed. Whhaatt ? The mere word "commitment" sends me on diarrhea for weeks. I am not ready for commitment yet !  One girl for years ? OMG !There you go ! See , It is not as easy as it sounds ! It requires a blessing from heaven to get all 10 steps aligned ! Screw up at any step and GAME OVER . Start the game all over again .From my experience , I have seen most guys blocked and fumbling around at the third or fourth step itself.It more or less feels like this 
Why are some people always single?
Are single people happier?
Why are you still single?
Why are so many decent people single nowadays?
Why am I single?
Several reasons but one needs special mention:They want to be single!Being single bestows upon them the below-mentioned privileges and more:They may decide to stay home for the weekend doing nothing, nothing at all! No message or call can change that decision. No one to give justification to.The freedom to say ‘NO’ is all theirs. They don’t need to do anything unless they really want to do it.Solo trips to any place, any time.Abundance of time to work on things that matter (priorities)Being broke for a long time doesn’t hurt.No judgements. There’s no one who is trying to bring them ‘up’ to the standard.Nobody expects them to behave in a certain way or behaves erratically if they don’t behave that way.Not to forget, the freedom to appreciate (check out) the beauty of the opposite sex and the ability to be friends with several of them.Sure, most of us have to give up these privileges some time in our lifetime, but what’s the hurry? And yes, I’m happy for those who have found the one for whom they have done it already. I hope it’s worth it :)Being in a relationship (ideally) brings physical and emotional happiness. But have we explored all the possible ways of reaching the same state? (Hint: food, nature, travel, hobbies, or even work)A lot of us find it scary to spend time in our own company, an underrated source of happiness (no kidding :P). Since when has it become a ‘thing’ to be in a relationship after a particular age?Several are in a relationship just for their physical needs, letting their partners dream up a future which will never come true. Who are they kidding? Openness can go a long way in keeping physical and emotional dependence separate. Better for both involved.Let’s not double up until and unless we’re absolutely sure of the reasons!Cheers :)PS: No, I have not had a history of girlfriends who were control freaks. Peace.
Single?This answer is going to annoy many.See. People marry because they want to have a family. Sex. Children.We humans woo the opposite gender, we say we are in love, then get married and produce children.Then what?Nothing. It continues and has continued for centuries.The same is for other animals too, though they dont get married to produce. They just do it.They woo their best possible mate and reproduce which continues.So, what i basically want to say that we living beings has no role on earth other than continuing our genes.Even if we humans or any other living being is going to get extinct the universe is going to lose nothing.So, coming back to question on why i am single.Since i am already born on the earth, i believe that instead of reproducing i must focus on other thing, because 99.99% of my human race wilk take care of that.My views are:Instead of reproducing i want to help those children who are already born but deprived of basic human needs.I want to spread the truth to people of all countries and all religious groups that since we homo sapiens have brain .USE it. No matter what your religious text says or the laws of the country is. Do not challenge the nature. Do not utilize the resources beyond its carrying capacity. Do not mess with other living creature. LET THEM LIVE. Since they do not have unions, does not agitate, doesn't mean they are useless.Instead of spreading my genes and taking pride of my geaneology i believe whole human race as one. Whether one stays in Nepal Or Canada, working towards betterment of planet must be the sole aim.Limit human population. Share resources. Give to the poor. People born poor have not done anything wrong. It was a mistake by their poor parents. They just did it in lust. Did not think what their children will eat or wear.Stop this nonsense country divide or boundary. If nature doesn't differentiate between countries when calamities arises how we foolish human have the right to make boundaries.I will be back and add soon more. There is very long list… meanwhile. HAPPY GENE SPREADING.
What are some reasons why people are single?
I can't help but say I'm annoyed by responses to this question that assume there is something wrong with single-hood.  Something wrong with the person, else why would they be single?  I know that many single people would prefer not to be, and I know many people who choose to be.  I also know people such as my brother who really must be in a relationship, it's how they are built.  Before my brother met his wife I used to "pray" that if there were a love of my life out there, please give it to my brother because he needs that and I'm fine by myself.  Some people yearn to raise children and while there are all flavors of family and circumstances, I can easily understand why the family minded seek a more traditional framework of marriage to accomplish that.  Why is it beyond comprehension that a person might choose to live independently? Being single is my lifestyle choice.  I was engaged to be married in 1995.  I was with the guy for 8 years or so, living together.  I had other live-in relationships before that.  My former fiance wanted marriage so badly that I tried to give it to him because I loved him.   But a month before the wedding I had to admit to myself I was dreading my future.   When I called off my wedding, I just faced up to it:  I am not cut out to be in a romantic relationship.  I'm extremely independent and I prefer it that way.  I don't like to feel I owe anybody anything.  I am not good at making men feel "needed" (heard that from my fiance and another former live-in lover).  I don't need, and I really (really!) don't enjoy being needed by another.  It makes me feel claustrophobic. I could go on but it strikes me as I follow this question how many people can't fathom the idea that a person might CHOOSE to be single, or perhaps not having chosen it, find they enjoy it.   My life is very full with friends, family, hobbies, and career.  I can improve myself because I have so much time to self-reflect.  There are many responses here to support why a person might choose to be single.  I just don't get how many can't accept this life style.  We are passing gay marriage laws in state after state.  Even if many of us are not gay, we understand that some of us are and have the right to marry and have traditional families.  There are many examples of life styles that are not like the one we choose for ourselves, why is it so hard to understand this one?

What are some reasons why people are single?
At 19, I CHOOSE to stay single because of the following reasons:1. I just got off a bad breakup with my first loveWonderful girl when I first met her but at my age, people change like mad because we are drastically looking for an identity to settle with. Drifted apart to only find out from her sister that my ex cheated on me. I did date several girls after the breakup and got into a relationship which lasted barely for a month. I realised I am not willing and unable to commit my time to a single person after the breakup, which leads on to the next point.2. I love the freedom of being single!I don't have to worry about my girlfriend getting wasted at the club and cheating on my back. I don't have to deal with the quarrels which imo, a bloody waste of time at 19. This time is better off for myself to indulge in my hobbies. I also get to bed several girls without the label of a cheater! (Afterall, we all just wanna have fun right?) Being single gives me lots of time to build myself stronger and honestly, I do attract girls more when I'm single! I don't have to attend to my girlfriend.3. I don't settle for anyone.At 19, I want to meet more people. Every person is unique and talking to them will inspire me and expand my knowledge. I do not wish to revolve my entire world around a single girl because of my intellectual curiosity. I don't want to look back and say: 'I wasted my time with that single girl when I could have....:SINGLE CAN BE AWESOME (except you might feel a little lonely somedays).By staying single, I do what I want and is able to explore the boundaries. And by settling with someone, I get into a comfort zone (Hell no! I wanna push the boundaries and see what I can do with my potential)Despite saying this, I love to be in love. But I want to be in love with someone who I can be extremely proud of, and not someone who I treat as a booty call. And the timing now is not great for me to be attached.HENCE I AM SINGLE!
Many people would suggest how awesome it is to be single and blah blah. But I disagree.I think it’s a choice which we all make based on circumstances.Unfortunately my last relationship where despite having exchanged rings, ended with her being in some other dude’s arm.It left a hole in me that might have filled but deep down I know, I have serious trust issues. I know maybe this girl is awesome, she’s kind, she’s sweet, she won’t ever betray me, but then again the doubt factor.It’s like, yeah I want to share. I want to tell someone about my life. I want someone whom I can call, tell how much happy I was today, how much sometimes I need motivation, but I know I just can’t.I might say i have great friends. The best I know. But then sometimes you know, you can’t share everything with your friends, well at-least not me.But let me assure you, I am perfectly fine. It’s not as if am dying, but the fact is sometimes, Yes I miss the feeling of love, I miss expressing everything to someone. Despite the fact I share everything with my mother but I know she is my Mother and she is not a woman to burden my problems with. She did a great job raising me into a fine Young Decorated Officer and now it’s my job to be there for her.Maybe yes I miss telling and discussing Twilight with some. Maybe I miss being someone’s Edward Cullen. Maybe I miss saying, Always.What is stopping me? Trust issues.I try to resolve it. I seemingly feel am headed in the right direction. I know I will find Love. I have to. It is the most beautiful feeling in the world. It’s an undying flame of passion and love that never extinguishes.Sometimes people have a hard time believing am single. I have to prove it. But those who understand me know why am single. I feel with every relationship failed, we loose a bit of ourselves which once defined us. I lost that bit and that remaining bit is locked somewhere safe for the lady that will grace my Life with her presence.I guess there is nothing more beautiful than Love. Especially when you are with the right person. Everything seems beautiful for when you lie down on the mountains across the grass under the less intense Sunshine, you do find Velvet flowers bloom out next.
What are some reasons why people are single?
I used to have an argument with this ethics professor of mine at least once a week over the difference between a reason and an excuse.  I believe that there is a definable difference between the two.  A reason is a justification for something, an excuse is something you offer up as justification for failure.  You don't give excuses for winning and you don't give reasons for losing.  I hear a lot of excuses for being single, but rarely do I hear reasons that make a lot of sense.  This leads me to a number of different conclusions.First and foremost: a majority of people are not single by choice.  Perhaps you haven't found the perfect person yet, maybe you're "not settling" for less than "you deserve."  Again these sound like excuses and they often are but many people think that making excuses is a bad thing.  It's not always a bad thing to make excuses.  But we take things so personally that even the perception of someone or something being different is enough to send us running in the opposite direction.Second: our standards are too high.  I've been single all my life and I'm pretty sure that this has been the chief culprit leading to the perhaps inevitable break-up of nearly ninety percent of my relationships.  It's like a checklist and if I can't check all the boxes I start souring on the relationship.  I call this the "un-single" test.  If you start thinking of someone as marriage material that checklist gets much longer as you start thinking about whether you'd be willing to spend the rest of your life with this person.  I think as we get older we lower our standards a bit, but whether this leads to successful relationships is a topic that is still being debated.Third: needs are different for both parties in a relationship.  Like I said before I approach dating with a mental checklist and I like being able to check off the boxes.  One thing that I value above everything else is my independence and it seems a lot of times like independence and relationships are somewhat anti-thetical.  Relationships inevitably take away some of our independence, but how much is too much?  I haven't been able to strike the right balance and part of the problem is that I'm a writer so by definition I'm weird, quirky, and I need a good deal of me time to think through my ideas.  At the same time having someone to bounce ideas off of can be invaluable.  Striking a balance is where things get complicated and my feeling is that I'm not alone in having an issue with personal independence and some of the co-dependence that comes from being in a committed relationship.Fourth: what was once cute is now annoying.  We've all been there.  Maybe she's got a great laugh or she flips her hair a certain way when she's talking, whatever it is it's something that makes her unique and that's what we're looking for when we're dating.  But there's a difference between dating and putting together a successful relationship.  When you're dating the little things don't often bother you because you're not around the other person long enough to let those things bother you, but in a relationship those little things get amplified big time and it usually doesn't take long before you identify all the little things that your partner does that tick you off.Fifth: you have different values and priorities.  There was this time in my life where I kind of thought that I could make anything work.  I call this the "Catcher in the Rye" syndrome because we look at the world like Holden Caulfield and tend to think that we can make things turn out the way that we'd like them to.  Idealism is a dangerous thing.  We've got to be realistic.  For instance, I once dated a Republican(!)  and I was absolutely convinced that politics weren't going to divide us but then there was an election and we were at each other's throats.  We had a lot in common and I was able to check off a lot of boxes with her, but the constant blaming of the poor for the plights of the "job creators" just drove me over the edge.Sixth: you have different personalities.  This one isn't a deal-breaker, but it certainly can be.  It's ruined enough of my relationships and I therefore think it's important enough to mention.  Extroverts can be really annoying especially if they try and convert you to their cause.  I dated this one woman who wanted to go out every night of the week and she didn't particularly care where.  I enjoyed spending time with her, but at the same time I need my space as I think everyone does in a relationship, so that obviously didn't last.  However of all the things that people put up with I see this one happening the most frequently.  My parents suffer from this for instance.  They've been married for thirty-one years.Seventh: some people are too clingy.  You know who you are.  I dated one woman who needed to know everything that happened in my day down to what I ate for breakfast in the morning.  One day she asked me to specifically describe the ingredients that went into the making of my omelette.  I tried not to let this bother me because our personalities were so close together and we had so many shared interests.  We're still good friends, but if she brings up breakfast she seems to know that just bringing it up frustrates me.  She still wants to know and I still tell her, but if she starts asking for details I have to tell her that I'm not going to do go through a list of everything I did in my day.Eighth: different visions for the future.  My plan for the future could go one of two ways, both of which I'm fine with.  I could see myself writing full time and living on the west coast or teaching full time and living wherever.  The fact that I don't have a one size fits all idea of the future is enough to frustrate some women who already know when they want to have kids and where said kids will go to school etc.  Needless to say this sets up a barrier that is difficult to overcome.  I like to have options, but I know plenty of people who don't.  I've met women who don't want to have kids.  Sometimes that's okay, sometimes it's not.  I'm not sure if I want to have kids so I like the woman I'm dating to at least have an open mind about it.  Too much one way or the other can cause there to be too much distance between what we want individually and what we want for each other.Ninth: attachment or non-attachment to material goods.  Some people need to have the latest iPhone the day it comes out.  I don't understand that line of thinking, but there are situations in which I'll accept it.  But if the person I'm dating places too much value on material goods then it's probably not going to work out between us because I live a relatively simple life and am happy living a relatively simple life.  Adding a lot of things to my life creates unnecessary clutter and I don't need more things to think about and worry about.  At the same time I'm not willing to live in a van, that's something that is just not in the cards for me.Tenth: different worldviews.  Somebody asked me the other day: "why can't you be happy all the time?"  My answer was relatively simple: depression.  But it's not so simple for everyone.  Not everyone has been diagnosed with depression (although nearly one in four have.)  We all have a unique way of looking at the world and we look at the world from different vantage points.  For instance, I grew up in a middle class family in a middle class neighborhood.  I'm the product of public schools, I've lived in the same relative area my entire life.  If I'm dating someone who grew up poor this can lead to problems.  For starters studies have shown that class mobility can be dependent on who your parents are and how they grew up.  Different people have different experiences that goes without saying.  This also has to do with values and just personal preferences as well though.  Some people place an enormous value on "people watching" something that I've never put a lot of value on.  People behave in the manner they do for any number of reasons, many of which we'll never understand.  Worldview and values are usually interconnected.The Wildcard: (s)he doesn't like to do x, y, or z.  I love movies.  I've always loved movies.  I can't see myself being with someone who doesn't love movies.  Being able to whisper to them: "hey doesn't that remind you of that scene from x movie?" is very important to me.  Other people have different dealbreakers like not liking pets or disliking potential in-laws.  Whatever it is there will always be a drawback to each person you develop a relationship with and they cannot always be overcome.  All in all: Who we love is the single most important decision we make in our lives.  I think it only makes sense to take as much time as you need to make the right decision.  At the same time, making excuses for every little thing that someone does that you wouldn't do isn't always an acceptable reason for being single.  If the reasons that you give for being single are reasons that you have been unable to find a life partner then I would like to reiterate that you're not giving a reason you're giving an excuse.  Some people say: "well, I just like being single" and that's okay if that's the real reason that you're single.  But there are a lot of people who make excuses for being single when they'd like to be in a relationship of some kind and that's not the same thing as enjoying being single.  I'd like to be in a relationship, but I'm not for the reasons stated above.  It's not that I enjoy being single, it's that what I'm looking for in a woman probably just doesn't exist.  Whether or not I'm okay with that only time will tell.
He saw her in college and got excited when he found she is his classmate.Started dressing good to impress her, tried to talk to her directly but not succeeded, Became friends in fb started chatting the whole day, She will wish him before every exams and interviews.He started to like her likes, dislikes, parents, care. Literally he started loving her. Whenever he reads her messages it sounded like she speaking in his mind. Her name become cutest name in the world for himHe started to think about her the whole day, whenever he hears romantic songs he thinks of herSo he tried to become close to her, but she found it is not just a friendshipShe started to avoid him, she replied to his messages very late, her messages lines become very small from “okay” to “k”. She stopped wishing him before exams and interviews. She never told bad about him to any other girls.finally she stopped speaking with him.He got depressed, cried in midnight, ignored studies, started being like idiot but never started to hate her. He lost believe in love and relationships.They become strangers to each other, He started to study hard .He found his parents and career is important than anything else. Even the last day of college they never spoke to each other . he found the difference between love and like. After college He got job.There after he never believed anyone blindly, He decided to avoid getting into relationship again unless it will end in marriage, because he knows how it hurts each other, so he decided to be single.If he/she is trying to remain single does not mean he/she did not got relationship, maybe he/she is waiting for the right one.Thanks for reading,Ranjith
I have dated a few men over the years and realized it’s better for me to be single. Well, I can only speak for myself and what I have learnt is am not good with confrontations and that is a big problem when you are in a relationship. A few reasons why I am single.My friends say that I have set the bar too high and that is why I don’t find anyone and I should learn to compromise. But To what extent. I feel it’s better to be very picky than date the wrong person. (Lesson learnt the hard way)Unfortunately, the few who pass my standards do not seem to think that I meet theirs!I am registered in a matrimony site as my family insist that I should put some effort in finding a guy. But the only effort I put in is to decline the proposals that come my way.I'm a wrong judge of people and I am super lazy. I get a proposal and I am supposed to talk to this guy. I am bad at making small talk. I don’t like to talk for long hours when I am in office, I don’t like to talk when I am watching my favorite serial on TV (Usually its one hour of comedy (Big Bang Theory/2 and a half men). And i have had guys tell me to decide which is more important TV or finding a life partner. And yes, i always chose TV.I don't make much of an effort to meet people. I rather give excuse than go out and meet. I just don’t find the need to get ready and waste my makeup and ironed clothes from my cupboard just to come back disappointed. I have already made up my mind.I am working most part of the day (hardly meet anyone at work), I spend my free time visiting NGO’s. Never a place to meet prospective guys.I'm an introvert (when it comes to things like this). I will not make the first move because the last thing i want is to be rejected. I won’t even say Hello to a guy unless he says it first.And the last but not the least, I have met this guy (my prince charming) who doesn’t even know I exist and I am hopeful someday he will notice me (though we live in different states). May be this is just another excuse for me to stay single. (read my blog for more about this)I found this answer by another person and I found it so true, so am taking the liberty of quoting it here:“Reasons that I might not be entirely to blame for are:Now that I'm getting uhh older, there are fewer single men my age around.Men, in general, are not looking for a serious relationship?Everyone's so busy these days!”

No, I believe the people who are attached to others are weak.I was in class 8th and I had a crush on one of my classmates, After facing rejection from her I felt heartbroken and had lost all of my confidence.There was this girl who lived near my house, we soon became friends. She was of my age and she was quite friendly. When she came to know about how that girl had rejected me, she consoled me and said”It’s her loss and you’ll find someone way better.” I felt really glad somebody understood me and we soon became best buds and shared everything.We would usually stay late in the park and stargaze for hours.We didn’t realize when our friendship grew into something stronger , maybe love. But neither one of us could actually figure it out.But, these things don’t last, one day she came to me, almost weeping. Her father had been transferred to Allahabad. I also found myself , wiping my tears. I asked her” Is there anyway we can make this work? We don’t have phones and parents won’t understand.” She said, “My Nani lives here, I’ll be here every summer and winter break.”By that time our studies for 9th class were about to begin and this seemed the only possible way.Time went by and the summer break commenced, but she didn’t come. One day I gathered up courage and asked the neighbours about it, saying that she had borrowed something.This is when I came to know that she had died of hepatitis a week ago.My whole world fell apart and I fucked up my academics, sports and physique that year. I didn’t tell this too anyone as I don’t want the pity of others, and because it’s too painful. People don’t understand how much pain you have to go through when you loose someone, around whom your whole life revolves.It’s been many years since then, I’m currently in my sophomore year of college.I still look upto the stars but now I feel you’re better single as you can’t get hurt this way.

Not even once!Well, maybe i’ve felt a little out of place when I go to the movies alone, and having others with their spouse doing ‘their stuff’… but i’ve not had the chance to regret it one bit.While I know it’s much better to be with someone, because iron sharpens iron… i enjoy being single. I can give you like 50 reasons, but:I have goals already…. having to add someone is too much work.My resources would be at stake… no +1, equals more food for me.I can be more productive with my time.I don’t have to stress with more details, like, ‘what she wore today, why she said what she said like 12 hours ago’, and all those mind games we can never win.I can go wherever i want, with little or no concern about having to dress to impress.No pressure with future questions like ,’ What are we?’ or ‘Will you stop loving me?’No challenge with watching what she wants for the sake of being ‘boyfriend material’…. i can’t handle that.No problems with trying to impress her over and over again… while being her boyfriend.No problems with dates… No I don’t remember the anniversary of your grandma’s sister’s dog’s death.I can put all my effort on myself, and improve myself much better.And many others.I know these are not valid reasons to be single. It’s more profitable to have someone to improve with….But I’ve never regretted it, for once!
If you have always been single, do you regret it?
No it gives me the confidence to live life on my own terms ..im not answerable to anyone.. don't need to justify my actions n choices.. im not possessed by or obsessed with someone .no drama..no breaking my head for hours on the phone . im free n independence is a required trait .. im detached and in the end its you for yourself ..others may walk on your path with you… but no one can walk it for you I have few good friends to share my space n life with.. and the rest with my mother ..being single is actually a realisation that u don't really need too many people to fend for yourself and survive.. it gives you independence and stability.. n the self sufficiency remains with you even when your so called boyfriend or husband or whatever leaves you.i have had my fair share of hookups n fun but im too narcissistic to let someone else be the centre of my universe..also I feel I need to b worthy of for someone to respect and trust me.. and im not there yet.. im in the making of myself.. to be deemed worthy of some individuals respect.. so it is more important to work on yourself first… no regrets ..I can say with my head and standards held high.. ofcourse I can make exceptions if the guy looks like Nick Bateman or Brad Pitt.. ;) but that's a different story
I've been in love twice in my life. Understanding the meaning of true love with one of those relationships. I've also been in relationships that I regretted entering on day one, as I knew it wouldnt work. After finding love that's deep, lasting and meaningful and then try to replicate prior feelings within other relationships, I've learned to stay single until I find another person that lights my soul on fire once more. Is there a possibility that I'll be single forever? Yes. And I'm ok with that. I'd rather be single than be with a person that's wrong for me, or that doesnt ignite my spirit. You can't really regret being alone if there isn't a partner for you to walk the path of life with.

I have many friends who are single and perfectly happy. There are many who are very unhappy with their life.The whole issue depends on what you want from life. Many due to their circumstances, family problems, cruelty by partners of their siblings, not interested to share their personal issues, take a decision to remain single. Many sacrifice their entire life for the benefit of family and welfare of parents.There is a friend of mine who says that there is plenty of milk available, then why buy a cow? I am not agreeing with him.I am a happily married man touching half century.Many wants no responsibility of running a family. They lead a care free life with no encumbrances.
If you have always been single, do you regret it?

I can't say, but I can tell you something I KNOW for a fact.You will regret being married to the wrong person if you rush into a marriage, "just to be married"Contrarily to what a lot of people will tell you, you don't have a "married by" date.  If you are worried you aren't meeting enough people, maybe ou should get out more and take up some hobbies that you enjoy for their own sake but offer the opportunity to meet and interact with more people.Do ge out and be social, make more friends, get more in touch with and develop your love of self.  Live your life to the fullest but don't stress about being married by X date.  The more you are having positive interactions with a variety of like minded people, the higher your chance of hitting it off with someone but don't push it or youll seem needy.  If your not interested in marrying anyone, then likely you've just never met the one who makes you reconsider.  Be open to relationships when they come but again don't worry about it.  If you're single and happy, content, then its not an issue.  I would suggest trying to develop as many good friendships as possible still though so that when you get older you will have close friends and not feel lonely.Everyone has different social needs.  Don't burn bridges but don't worry if our own don't necessarily follow the social "norm"

I've written about this in another answer but I am adding more! I don't know if I'll ever get married but I was supposed to be getting married in December, but I called it off. I loved him and I trusted him more than any single person on the planet. I suspected things, and I know for a fact that I am a very intuitive person, but he always denied everything I would try to bring up and solve. He had to go away for a while… we have a daughter together so he's only seen her twice since the last month. He told me he didn't want to be with me because he needs to focus on himself but he had also spoken about a girl that he'd met 'at this place' that sounded… out of the ordinary for him. I knew what was happening but I didn't want to believe it. He would never do that to me right?It turns out that I ran into a mutual friend whilst out and about whilst my now ex was at his house with our daughter so he could see her before going back. This mutual friend told me that my now ex is seeing a girl 'at this place' and added that my ex is not only into women… which I also knew but didn't want to admit to myself. He refuses to confirm nor deny until I tell him who it was that told me this and got in his car and left. I told him if he loved or even cared about me in the slightest he'd be honest with me, and didn't. I know he would've said no if it weren't true. He ended it with me to work on himself but is now dating a girl with a whole lot of her own issues, and couldn't even inform me. Our rule was if one of us started seeing someone we'd let each other know also because she share a daughter and want to know who the newcomer is in her life. I asked him if her name was… the girl he'd mantioned before, and I saw the look in his eye and I knew. I had a melt down. I cried, I sobbed, I begged just for an answer and he refused. My heart feels like it's torn into a million pieces, but imagine I had married him and then years down the line, find out he isn't the person I thought he was.So in my case, I do not regret not getting married.
Will I regret not getting married ?
Someone saw a man wearing his wedding ring on is middle finger…”Sir”, he said, “you are wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger”… “Yes”, the man replied, “I married the wrong woman!”That, of course, can go both ways… “I married the wrong man, or in our new world, “the wrong partner”.In my younger years, if you not married by a certain age, something was wrong with you. I was coerced into getting married to a woman I knew in my heart was not the right fit for me. She would have been a perfect fit for someone else, but I could feel in my gut that it would be a rocky road ahead. She had an affair, our first year of marriage and while I tried to keep my wedding vows of “better or worse”, it just got worse and twenty-years later, as my health started to deteriorate from the stress I separated and later filed for divorce.Today, the odds are against you that your marriage will survive for the long-term. If you are happy in your life and enjoy just hanging out with friends with the occasionally added benefits, then keep doing what you are doing with no guilt. You get to use your money and your time to your bidding without anyone else dictating your life. One billionaire wrote, when discussing financial decisions…”if floats, flies, or f…s…then rent it!” Somewhat crude, but perhaps accurate…
Will I regret not getting married ?
You may not regret getting married. But only if you're not marrying the right person. I am a firm believer that when you get married you should be getting married to someone that you want to be with till the day you die. And that means well until your 93 even if you make it 200. Marriage is supposed to be about committing and spending your life with someone that you love so much you could never imagine going a day without them. So unless you feel that type of bond and relationship and dedication to someone it's better not to get married. A really strong marriage is probably one of the best things you can ever experience in your life. But it only works if you meet someone that you literally feel you can't live without. It also makes it easier when you have such a strong bond to weather the ups and downs of a marriage. Everything will marriage will have its good times and its bad times. But what gets people through the bad times is the love that they have for the other person and the willingness to work out whatever issues have come up because you value them and love them so much.

Yes! I was very immeture! My siblings were all much older than me, & did not play with me! No neighbor kids! No school kids came home with me! I grew up entirely alone! My father was in the hospital, & my mother worked to support us! Got my first real job at age 27, & had my first real date! Nice girl who tried to put some moves on me, but I was too ignorant to recognize her signals, so she moved on! Another girl waited 13 years for me to return home, & died 2 weeks before I was going to propose to her! I went on to live 50 years without a wife, kids, Or sex! I have major regrets! When I was 12 YO, an 11 YO girl offered to have sex with me- I was SCHOCKED, that someone so young would consider having sex, & declined! I have often wondered, if I had accepted her offer, would it have made a major improvement in my life! Bless You, Betty! Bill
Will I regret not getting married ?
How can a stranger who doesn't know you answer this? I don't even think your best friend can answer this. I don't even think you can answer this until you are quite old and on your deathbed, unless of course you regret it much earlier.Just live your life and if you don't get married, you'll find out, and if you do get married, then you won't.
Will I regret not getting married ?
I have read back cover of a book written by French writer (I don’t remember his name). The main idea of his book was that “the biggest success someone can achieve is not to be rich, famous, powerful, but to own a good family”. He was comitted suicide in a hotel room at approximately his seventies. He also was an unmarried writter.I think most elderly unmarried people feel regret at the end of their life. Because having a family, children is a source of joy. Unmarried people lost such an opportunity and there is no way to turn back again.Also all living creatures naturally need reproduction.If you think that I will live or hang out with diferent people in different periods of my life, most probably, especially if you are a woman, there will be no one with you in your hour of need. You will be capitalised in your prime, and then you be left to your fate at least sensually.Think again.
Do you regret never marrying?
Never, not even for an instant. My partner and I have lived together for almost 33 years now and raised two, now grown up, sons. We still love each other very much and plan to spend the rest of our lives together.Why do we need the church and the state to tell us we're allowed to do all this?Most of our friends who got married are now divorced or separated. Most of our children's classmates were married - and divorced. Ours was the only intact partnership in either of our childrens’ high school classes - for seven years running!Marriage … it’s just a piece of paper folks. Commitment? That's quite a different thing.
Do you regret not getting married?
‘Do you regret not getting married? ‘To me personally, just the opposite, I regret getting married, three times. All my marriages ended up with divorces, and ALL three times, in various degrees, is because my former spouse stole from me, lied to me, cheated on me, and then ran off with another man. I have become very cynical about this whole marriage institution.

What is it like to grow old and never be married?
Mine is a completely different answer, but it's truthful am 69 and have never been married, not really even close to it. As a girl, I never dreamed of romance and weddings. I mostly had comfortable friendships with boys and young men and did little dating. Even my younger sister didn't marry until she was 30. My parents had a wonderful, loving 60-year union so I guess they set the bar pretty high for the four of us children.                                                                      In my early 20s, from university, I went with one man for several years and we lived together for some months of that time. I was mostly trying to discover what this "love business" was all about and if it was for me. The relationship never felt solid enough to me to base my life on, so when he drunkenly proposed to me one night, I told him we would talk about it in the morning. The subject never came up again. I decided, after 7 (mostly) unhappy years to move on with my life. I also vowed to find out if men and women could really learn to trust one another and build genuine intimacy on that. Since that time, I've had many wonderful friendships with men, without manipulative games or tension. I can honestly say I've never spent time and effort to find a life mate.In my 30s I met and joined a spiritual group that practiced celibacy before marriage. Although I was matched with a man in the group, he left before I really got to know him at all. Once again, I moved on in my life. Instead of waiting around for happiness to come to me, I went for adventure. Fortunately, I had an opportunity to move to Moscow, just as the Soviet Union was collapsing and I went for it. Now, for the last 22 years, I've been an expat teaching English in Russia surrounded by friends and students of several generations. It's been interesting, challenging and rewarding. I can honestly say I didn't miss a private social life at all.That said, I would say that I'm finally "ready" for marriage and want to make that the next adventure in my life when I move back to the U.S.early next year. I feel I've had so many rich life experiences and now would love to have someone to share them with. I've always been somewhat domestic, but I'm eager now to build a nest to grow old in with a husband. I understand that I/we may only have 5-15 years to enjoy the fruits of married life, with health and lifespan issues looming at the age of 70. But, then again, a lot of the stressors (career and children) of younger married couples will not dominate our time and decisions. Looking back, I guess I was fearful of settling down with a small-minded person who might try to hold me back from growing or living my life fully. Now that I've really shown what I can accomplish (in a foreign country, no less), those anxieties are completely melted away. I certainly know who I am and what I have to offer. I've also seen enough of life and worked with thousands of people so I've gained a pretty good understanding of interpersonal interaction and learned to be flexible. I also know it won't be easy going from "me" to "we", but then, nothing really worthwhile is. I'm approaching marriage with a fresh enthusiasm that few people my age do, and I'm not sorry I waited first to really mature. I guess you could call me a REALLY LATE BLOOMER.---It's now the summer of 2015. After returning to the U.S. from Russia in Dec, 2014, I continued to meet eligible men online. I've now met a wonderful man, 12 years my junior, a retired widower, and have moved to his home in Montgomery, Alabama to prepare for our marriage in a few months. - Erin

What is it like to grow old without ever having a girlfriend or wife?
What is it like to have not been ever married?
I'm in my mid-40s. I don't see it as different from the rest of my earlier life. You go through the same routine each day, one day at a time. I have my projects, which hold intense interest for me. I feel like I have a mission in life, and I've had it since I was a teenager. That is the pursuit with which I struggle. I get joy and some pain out of that. I love learning, and I have sometimes wondered if the reason I haven't gotten married is that I'm more in love with my work than I am with the idea of being married. On the other hand, I certainly wouldn't mind being with a woman who shared a compatible pursuit with mine, and we could share that love of learning. I just haven't found her yet.In my earlier years I dealt with the judgment that some thought I might be gay. Some wondered, looking as I did, and perhaps being who I was, "How is it possible" that I wasn't married, or at least "with someone." I was mystified at the wonder. I never found it that hard to stay single. I’d shrug, and say, "Just being myself." Sasha Cagan some years back came out with this idea of the Quirkyalone. I've thought that sounds quite a bit like me.There were stretches of time where I wondered if there was something wrong with me, especially after I saw a few of my friends get married, and start having children. I wasn't even dating. It all happened around the same time, in my late 20's/early 30's. Their age was similar. The idea started creeping up on me that my chance of getting married and having children (which has seemed like a nice idea) was passing me by. I got sad about being alone sometimes, though it passed. It wasn't until I got into my forties that it dawned on me that my suspicions about myself were all wrong. The reason I haven't gotten married is I haven't met a woman who is available, and who impresses/inspires me. Most of the women I’d consider were already in other relationships/married. So they were "off the market," as far as I was concerned. While I'd be drawn to others, I didn't feel comfortable just being drawn because of their attractiveness. I wanted to get a sense of the real person, and that's where it's ended. I realize quickly that we're going in different directions.There was a point when I reached 40 where I figured if it hadn't happened by then, it was never going to happen, and I needed to just get used to it. I'm not willing to say never, but the idea that it may never happen is a thought that's been with me since my late 20's.Looking back on my conceptions of this, I've also wondered whether I ever wanted a relationship for the right reasons. Maybe it was just a physical need. I've since heard that many men who get married do so because creating a family is their primary goal in life. I've never felt that way. I've desired that, but my primary goal in life--my first love, you could say--has always been something else. I've always suspected, though, that if I met a woman who I wanted to marry that a lot of that would change--at least for a while.I have sometimes thought that I've been fortunate that I haven't gotten married and started a family, because if I had, there is no way financially I would be able to pursue the kind of work (projects) I've been doing. Though, one never knows.
I love it when people ASSUME that getting married earlier in life will always last into old age and as a result that they will always have a companion and not ever feel lonely or unhappy.Nowadays we haveA divorce rate currently hovering at around 55% in this country (USA), a resurgence of "Feminism" and “gender confusion”.A new generation of women (and some retired ones) who are choosing to either never get married or never marry again.A generation of men reaching middle age and walking out on their marriage while sometimes “trading up for a younger model”.A generation of men choosing to remain bachelors for life—fearing a divorce would leave them penniless and without access to kids (if they even choose to have kids) giving rise to the MGTOW (men going their own way) movement.An increase in homosexuality (most don’t marry even when it became legal), Tran-sexuality and everything else in between.A generation of men and women who may want to get married someday but feel stuck due to social anxiety, unable to relate to the opposite sex or even get the courage to ask anyone out.A generation of men who are not making as much money as their fathers/grandfathers did and thus feel that they wouldn’t have much to offer a woman by way of financial security.A generation of old people who are still married into their 60′s, 70′s, 80’s absolutely lonely and miserable in their 30–50+ year marriage.Given all these conditions its shocking that there are still people out their who believe that marrying in the younger years will somehow guarantee everlasting happiness, fulfillment and bond to their spouse well into their old age.For most people life doesn't end their 60′s and certainly doesn’t have to be less fulfilling simply because they are single. There are literally TONS of things people can do in their 60′s thru 90′s to not feel "lonely". Working, volunteering, traveling, attending social clubs, chess club, dancing, card games etc. —the list is quite long and only shortened by the health status of the senior.Not to mention that marriage in old age is not necessarily “bliss” while being single is not necessarily “miserable and lonely”. My grandparents are a perfect example of this—My grandfather abandoned my grandma in her early 60's, then he remarried at 65 and lived with his second wife until his death in his 90's. His second wife was almost never around for him and neither were his kids (especially since he lived far from them). Definitely NOT a happy and fulfilling marriage or life.Grandma, on the other hand, remained single and lead a full active work and social life well into her old age until the last 6 years of her life where she had to slow down and let one of her daughters and a caregiver help her out at home. She ended up much better off than grandpa and died peacefully in her sleep.Three of my aunts who entered their 60s being single, without children, still had active lives until they passed in their late 60s-70's. I have another aunt who is divorced in her 70's and still very active socially. She’s “too busy” to be lonely.My former grandmother in-law lost her husband to illness when she was in her late 50′s. She CHOSE not to remarry (though she dated a few times on and off) and lived a fulfilling and active social life into her 90s- parties, fundraising, working out, swimming, crafts, church pot luck etc. There was always something going on in her house-several times a week. I have no idea where she had the energy to do everything she did, especially since she wasn't the picture of "perfect health".My former step-mother in law who was 62 when she was abandoned by her husband for a "younger model" wants NOTHING to do with re-marrying. She too doesn't have children. Yet she leads a very active social life now in her late 60′s she does jazzercise, is a freelance caregiver and organizer, attends church services and is involved in other community activities. Last I heard she had gotten a roommate/friend, another single senior lady and together they have a blast.My single and former Mother in law is now in her 70's and moving from frigid temp state to sunny warm state and closer to one of her kids. Her other children want nothing to do with taking care of their mother (that happens alot-you cant count on adult kids in your old age) who is getting over an illness. She is still active but realizes she will need help so she is planning on getting a part-time caregiver/housekeeper as she becomes less able to do things around the house. She is still socially active.My point- THERE ARE A LOT of single baby boomers in their late 50′s, 60′s, 70′s and 80's and there will be a lot more. People who never got married, who are divorced or who are widows and widowers.Life does not guarantee you a spouse into your old age, so if you are counting on someone else to make you "happy" or "less lonely" STOP. Start getting used to doing things for yourself and know that life can be amazing even without a spouse.Some people that face depression in their old age do so because they suddenly find themselves alone after decades of counting on someone else to make them happy instead of finding fulfillment in work, activities, classes, spiritual development and socializing with others. So when their spouse dies or leaves them they become emotionally lost-not knowing what to do, where to go or how to find happiness without a spouse by their side.Finally, there’s the question/concerns of health issues in old age. Sometimes that is a valid excuse to hide from the world, often times it is not.Every single one of my family members starting in their 60s had health issues--often serious--heart, diabetes, spinal degeneration/pain, high blood pressure etc. and every single one worked through pain and health problems, managed to remain socially and physically active.The more sedentary you are as you grow older, the bigger the health problems. That is what my 75 year old half blind, half deaf, heart diseased, diabetic mother told me. She doesn't stop and she goes out EVERY DAY to get some sun and also do activities—library, crafts, classes, exercise (walking), shopping etc. doing these things have kept her diabetes and heart condition under control.So stop worrying about tomorrow, whether or not you’ll get married, whether or not you’ll have kids and live your life!
I am 'over forty' and never married and I don't see it ever happening.When I was younger, I longed to find The One. I was engaged several times and in numerous relationships. I lived with a couple of guys early on but  I had a BAAAD break-up when my youngest was about 2 and I swore I would never let another adult into a position of power within our household. As such, my kids have grown up relating  to my companions only as friends of the family with no say in how their lives were conducted. This has been an obstacle in my relationships - my partners have felt like outsiders looking into the magic circle of my family - but I don't regret it. I was lonely for a lot of years, but I have come to believe that much of that was about sex. While we are still fertile, biology lashes us to find a mate and make more babies. Since my hormones have begun to wind down, I find I have no drive to find a companion. I don't miss sleeping with someone. I don't miss arguing with someone. I don't miss having to get used to someone who eats with their mouth open or farts with abandon. I, on the other hand, greatly enjoy the fact that I may eat with my mouth open and fart whenever the muse moves me. I do miss having breakfast in a little open air cafe by the ocean and reading the papers on Sunday morning and having someone to complain to about the government. I do miss, occasionally, when something really good or really bad happens, sharing it with someone really intimate. I have great friends - but let's face it, the events of my life are just news to them. When you are married, the events of your life are also the events of your partner's life. I have said for quite a long time now that I believe my primary relationship is with art. I have a relationship with writing and music that fluctuates in the same way my friends' and relatives' marriages seem to do; sometimes I hate my creativity and feel smothered by it, I want to leave it but I can't, I feel trapped by my gifts, other times, I love it and I can't spend enough time with it, I feel in love with my projects, I feel nurtured by them, I never feel alone when my creative relationship with myself is in good shape. But then, there are long periods of time when I don't 'put in' to the relationship and as a result, I don't get anything out of it; it gets stale and old and I wonder if that's all there is. But then something will happen, some new idea will take hold of me and I fall in love with my own creativity all over again. I should mention that my kids fill the very human need for strong love bonds in my life. I don't think I could enjoy my singledom nearly as much if I didn't have great relationships with them. I expect to grow old and never be married. It suits me.

There is a saying "One can love all women or one woman, but not both".I chose the first, and I made the right choice.Of course you must not make false assumptions.I have never been married, nor unlucky in love.I have lady friends from nearly sixty years ago.I have men friends in their late 70-80's who fall madly in love; one married the girl he was at college with and was a great grandmother when he proposed.One became an expert dancer in his 80s having never danced before in his life, to win the heart of a lady.I have a lady friend in her 70's who spends much time online dating, and scores better than most women half her age.To some extent the term 'Grow old' can mean several things.Do you mean physically old where you are dependent on others for your care.Do you mean mentally old where you no longer participate in social events.Do you mean spiritually old where you have beliefs and a lifestyle out of keeping with younger generations.Of perhaps even fashionably old where you are seen as an anachronism.In regard to being married, then not having been married means that one is not part of the married scene. This is quite different for men an women. When a man gets married, in most cases he drops his social life. He may have a friend or two, but he will rely mainly on his wife to organise events for family and friends. Married men find it very difficult to make new friends, which is why their work is so important to them. Women tend to have friends from family and neighbours so even in old age they can get some support in times of stress.Again, men make less effort to retain contact - even with their own children - as they get older.Old unmarried man will generally keep up with his 'mates' from work or hobbies.An old unmarried man will generally be self-sufficient in being able to look after himself, but may commonly become quite untidy without a lady to either care or scold him into being more presentable.My experience is that men who get married late in life tend to benefit the most.This extends to men who do not get married but take a partner late in life. This is probably because as we get older we realise that people who need each other have a better relationship than those that love each other. And those that care for each other have a better relationship than those that need each other.
52, and I share my home with my Mother, and my sister, my son is grown and moved on, long time ago. I have a garden, a comfortable home, a nice ride, and I am fine. Many yrs ago, I married a young fellow with Ringling Brothers Circus, lasted 2 weeks. I doubt if I ever walk that walk again, I am comfortable, meaning OLD, older hair, body, face.. (BODY).. yeah. (chuckle) It’s OK! it’s OK…. I cant imagine trying to get used to a man in my life now,, the only man that was ever really in my life,, was my Father,, and he has been gone a long long time.. Sometimes it’s sad,, but I don't have to go through the good-byes at the end of a 50 yr marriage, I don’t have to worry about him getting sick, and me having to do things I never had to do before,, (like mow or snow blow) I already do those. No,, it’s ok….. it’s ok.
Before integrating the duo, the musician must rehearse alone.(Quoted from my book:) In fact, for our sages, as we have seen, human love is the touchstone of divine love. Hence, throughout the entire heroic process (and this process may last several lives), the predestined “duo” should coincide if not always, then often. The Two will then come together to play that melody that they rehearsed by themselves. After all, that’s why we come into this world: to rehearse, to put our soul to the test in order to polish it, to clean it of impurities. Just like a musician hones his technique during rehearsals. Practice makes perfect. Reincarnations are as vital for the soul as daily physical contact with his instrument is for the musician. We cannot clean the impurities off our soul all the way up from Heaven, just as a musician cannot perfect his technique just by studying musical theory. Theory is the necessary foundation, but it’s useless if he does not translate that theory into practice. And that takes time and effort. In the case of a musical duo, perfecting their technique is vital, for the musicians’ harmony on stage depends on it. The more refined their individual technique is, the tighter they will sound, and the less dissonant will their performance of that joint melody be, that melody of which each one of them plays half the notes, so to speak. There will come a moment, after many intense rehearsals, when that double melody will sound as if it’s being played by one musician only, which is what this is all about. And well, Blanca, the same is applicable to predestined lovers, whose ultimate objective –unification- also depends on the refinement of their souls: the more refined they are, the more refined and true their love will be. And true love is the creator of unification.
I was asked to marry when I was 16. I was headed to college after high school and didn't want to be a married college student so I declined. I have had boyfriends most of my life, but none has ever wanted to marry me. Mostly because they had been married and had a bad experience I think. I have lived with a few men too. Mostly I don't like not being able to use the word "husband" I call my mate now, (17 years) "my fella" Ick, I hate it, but can't come up with anything better. I do think of him as my mate. I think of him and his son as my family. Secondly I think about the things that people get out of even bad marriages like part of the persons social security and pension. I'll never have that. I hear people say it's overrated but I am sad that I have never been married.Thank you for your interest.
Getting married doesn’t mean happiness, or that you’ll go into your 70’s and beyond with company or people that actually do care about you.Know of so many people who married and divorced, and many more married and secretly feel dead and bored.Having children doesn’t mean that they will care for you either when old and sick. No, it doesn’t. I witnessed the opposite more often.Bottom line-live the life you want and do what you truly find that brings you joy. We’re all alone in the end.

Older Quorans who chose to remain single and unmarried, how did your life turn out? Do you regret your decision?
It was difficult for my Mum to come to terms with the real truth that I didn’t want children and I was too independent to be married.I remained independent. I still am. But I got married.For the first time; having lived a life of utter “independence”, I figured it was time for a change. I was 45 and childless. Before we tied the knot, I would become aware there were 4 children I would call family.3 boys, 12, 14 and 16. A girl 22 from a “night out”.We sailed albeit jaggedly. But our lives wouldn’t be the same.Adversity followed.We had been renting my house out. The bills incurred by the children were unfathomable. I had to sell it.One by one by one, as the boys tried me for a fool, I decided I wasn’t going to be taken for one.As each turned their father against me, and I watched the mechanics in motion, I began to wonder what the hell I’d walked into.We were burgled. It turned out to be his oldest son who did the deed. He was supporting a drug habit.The middle boy decided he didn’t want to work but couldn’t pay his rent either so finished up in our home. On drugs, he was going nowhere fast.The youngest seemed to be focused. He was. He’s gay.They moved out; one by one. The bank was breathing down our necks.We finished up selling our house.And when regret was hovering on the doorstep, we found ourselves in paradise. It’s funny, but the 12 years of shit I’d been through turned out to be the best because there was a lesson we learned.Look after yourself.We’re spending the inheritance.No regret.

How is it to be unmarried life long? Do they regret their decision in old age?
Older Quorans who chose to remain single and unmarried, how did your life turn out? Do you regret your decision?I will be 65 this year. I have never been married, as the circumstances were never right. I sometimes had stronger feelings for someone than they had for me, and sometimes it was the reverse.The hardest part has been the economics. In recent years, some other women have told me that they admire my strength and will to keep going. I am also pretty set in some of my ways now and am no longer interested in marriage.From the experience of some of my friends as well as strangers, there are no guarantees that either a partner or children will take care of a person in old age. That is true in the United States, and most likely true in many other parts of the world.My main concern is to try to ensure that I have enough savings to take care of my living needs for the rest of my life. That is probably more frightening living in the United States than it would be living in some other countries. And my annuity is from working for the USG.Requirements for some professions have changed over the years. If you can, find a way to do something at which you excel that you also love.I have met a variety of people during my lifetime. I have known several people who had partners (sometimes spouses, sometimes others) who have had controlling partners. Within the confines of my income, and health, I have few regrets about my life.One of the best things about remaining single in the United States is that I can take a class, go to a movie or play, go to karaoke, not wear makeup, and wear what I want (assuming I meet any dress code for a place I am going to). if I choose to go to the library, binge watch something on my computer, write an article, etc., no one in my life is going to get away with telling me that I can’t do itWhen I was dating (years ago) some guys tried to get me to use make up, not use make up, control what I was going to wear. One even tried to force me to drink a grasshopper (creme de menthe and something else). He was so furious that he drove recklessly all the way home!I try to stick to my legal, moral and ethical obligations. One of my friends recently described me as, “…not being a wallflower!” I take that as a compliment. I take weight training classes for over half the year, do yoga with the same friend, go to roller derby bouts—as a fan (I don’t have a death wish at my age!), and do many other things.When I am lonely, it isn’t all the time! You need to realize that you can also be in a relationship with someone and be lonely! While it would be nice to have more income, I doubt that my life would be better if I had the chance to live it over again. But I do wish that I knew some of the things I know now at a younger age.I just want to add that regardless of age, almost everyone has something to contribute—at least to a conversation. Sprinkle some of your words with kindness, and sometimes you will see a very different person than a you would have a few minutes ago!

I’m 40. It wasn’t really ever a conscious choice nor is it absolutely be all end all.I’ve traveled all over the world for decades and a marriage caliper relationship has just never lined up with that.I have Nothing against it and not now doesn’t mean NEVER, I just require someone who’s as interested in travel as much as I am…. But people like that are always ships passing in the night…It’s not like people who work standard nine to 5 and play league volleyball and go to a regular church and they are running into the same 500 people for years on end.I meet 30 new people a day…. But interact with them touch and go over the course of a life time.
I’m a 30 year old virgin and I live with my two best friends from my high school days. I make sure my rent is paid, the meter is topped up and the fridge is stocked. After that, I can do whatever I want, when I want.I shed a tear when I hear the stories of my married work colleagues when I hear how little free time or options they have.You can’t put a price on freedom.
Do you regret your life?
How is it to be unmarried life long? Do they regret their decision in old age?
Do you regret any relationships in your life as of now?
Why did you choose to remain unmarried?
How do you live your life so that you are happily married and never regret giving up being single?
Older Quorans who chose to remain single and unmarried, how did your life turn out? Do you regret your decision?Actually, I married at 40! My daughter is now 25. My wife is a bit older, but I could never tell any difference.I had wandered around in my youth, catching odd jobs, even entering a Dominican Novitiate, and then leaving. After finally starting my own business and making enough to start a family, I married. While I regreted the decision at first, I had to acknowledge I had made that decision and stick by it! And then along came my daughter!
I knew when I was quite young that I truly did not want to marry or have children, and I have remained single and child-free my whole life. I do not regret my decision at all, it allowed me to find success and fulfillment in my only real interest: my career, and doing that has given me much satisfaction. It’s not that I dislike people, I just never had that yearning to be a wife or to take care of children.I’m grateful that I had that freedom and was not born into a culture that denies women the ability to choose their life-path by selling them into marriage when they are very young.
I’m old, and I never really expected to get married, although I was serially monogamous. I met my wife in 1980 and we never spoke about marriage until she demanded I stop the car one day and said “I want to be married” so I said … OK. (Romantic eh?)I found out later that she was concerned about my comments about the pretty women in an office that I was scheduled to move to.We married on the tenth anniversary of our first date. (that’s romantic right?)
Ill answer that via an interaction between a great sage and his student.Student…” I am now at the marrying age and have chosen a bride…but I am also aware, that if I commit, I may miss out on all the female beauty I interact with each day” ( he may have been one of the few straight hairdressers hehehe).Master.” Doesnt matter what you choose…you will regret either way”

Here are some real stories, you be the judge:1. “My ex was in undergrad when I moved to LA to pursue a career as a full-time writer, and he was in a northern California town doing pre-med. Because of starting my new career and getting settled, I had to focus a lot on LA stuff, and couldn’t go see him often so it became really complicated. And he would get exasperated and act like writing was frivolous, or that it somehow wasn’t a ‘real’ job by his definition, even though I was earning a full-time living doing it. So eventually I had to be like ‘You need to respect my times of working, even if it is at home,’ and he just was mad disrespectful and so I broke up with him. And NO I do not regret it.” –Jessie, 242. “My story is actually about my parents. My mom divorced my dad when I was really young, and I never knew the story, but now I know as an adult: She wanted to go back to school to have a career, and my father, who was a very traditional Indian man, did not want her to work with three children. So she divorced him (which she could only do because she was in America, but most of her family shunned her), and spent several years struggling through grad school as a single mother.Now I am proud to say that she is a psychologist with her own practice, no more student debt, and three college-educated or current-student children. She is also remarried, to a man she met in grad school. She never regretted it for a second, and has always instilled in me that anyone who wouldn’t want you to have your career is not the right person for you.” –Nat, 233. “I used to be one of those cliché New York 20-somethings who was obsessed with her career, and I absolutely loved it. I took real pride in being the first one at my office, and the last one to leave, even though I had a 45-minute train ride from Washington Heights to SoHo. I loved my job, I loved getting ready for work every day, and I loved the experience of being at the office. I was working for a small PR firm that was in its infancy and demanded of us 70+ hour weeks in exchange for a mediocre salary, lots of really cool events with free booze, and free stuff from brands and clients. Looking back I can see now that it was one of those startup jobs that took advantage of its employees, but no one could have convinced me to leave it.At the time, I was on-again, off-again with the same guy I had been seeing since college, who at the time was living in New Jersey and working there, as well. I knew that he wanted me to move out there, or at least compromise in Hoboken/Jersey City, and start moving towards marriage. But I couldn’t. I wanted to marry him, but I also knew that he was more interested in a slow-paced lifestyle than I was, and I didn’t want to sacrifice my glamorous “New York Life” for what he could offer me. One night over dinner, he bluntly asked me when I planned on slowing up on my office hours, as I had been promising to do for over a year. I told him, partially because I was already a little drunk at this point, that I was “never going to choose him over my career.” I could tell he was really heartbroken, and we stopped seeing each other pretty quickly after that.I do regret it, when I think about it, because I’ve never met a guy nearly as good for me as him since, and I’ve also cut back on my work hours significantly and changed jobs (almost four years later), for my own sanity. Ultimately he was right, and though I’m not living in Jersey, I definitely live a more slow lifestyle than I did before. I don’t know if we would have lived happily ever after, but I’m sad that I will never know.” –Maya, 28Source: 5 Women Who Chose Career Over Love Share Why They Did It

Career and Love are like two important ingredients of life that each one of us need to make out the perfect recipe, but life come with choices and one needs to make some hard choices in life.But if it ever come down to Career and Love, there will never be choice. A true love will always have a respect for your career. And prioritizing does not mean that sacrificing something for something. You can organize everything, and yes of course you will be leading a awesome life.As the life progresses career might remain same or change depending upon what you want at that point in the life but your love life will turn into marriage and that is the point where a big choice has to be made by you and will depend upon your partner a lot.You have a huge dream but being with him/her makes you feel that you won't be able to pursue it to completion.You and your partner both have huge dreams that don't allow you to be together on samd plate.You and your partner have jobs in different parts of world.You and your partner have a different dream cities in mind.This choice might turn out to be a hard one and might affect your career or love. But it's you who have to make it and I can assure you regret is not a good feeling. And this amount of regret won't let you live life.Sacrifice is part of love. And you will have to sacrifice things for your love of life and your love for career. The choice is yours, make sure you don't regret it….
Believe me, you will never regret choosing career over love unless you are a millionaire or billionaire.The respect and appreciation from people around you due to work done by you feels amazing .Plus the awesome money that you make quickly fades away that memories and bullshit concept of love.You can always find love in your life and every love feels same as the first love.
The fact you are even asking the question says a lot. It varies from person to person. Someone could prioritise career and be very happy with all the fame, respect and money while another may not. Who said when you choose love, you don’t get respect ? Do you see people, who’ve chosen love, begging at a station? But it could be that they may not earn as much as the other lot, may not have a very big car or a big fat house. Then again, people could be just as happy with this way of life and a little bit of love rather than heavy earnings and no one to share stuff with.Happiness is only real, when shared.But in a world like ours, choosing your career would be an easy option. The other needs courage, though it is totally personal.

What common mistakes do people make when choosing a life partner?
My Dad gave me a ton of fantastic advice over the years, but a couple of simple and powerful analogies he shared with me came to mind when I saw this question.The first lesson came up when I was learning to drive: there was a tricky intersection near my house where cross traffic does not stop. As a newly licensed teen driver I’d get a little nervous when having to chose the right moment to turn. I tended to sit there too long, waiting for the perfect gap from traffic coming in both directions. And of course the longer I waited, the more anxious I’d feel, particularly when a line of cars started forming behind me introducing even more pressure, setting up the perfect scenario for an increasingly desperate driver to panic and rush out at the wrong time with disastrous consequences….(Lucky for me, I had my Dad patiently at my side reminding me not to worry about the cars queuing up behind me, pick a gap that is safe and good and head out confidently and calmly).After the first time this happened, my Dad explained that unfortunately he has witnessed this same thing happen far too many times to women when choosing a life partner (he’s a psychiatrist specializing in relationships). They tend to pass up good, promising potential partners while waiting for the “ideal”, “perfect” partner. Then slowly pressures start piling up (biological clock, nagging parents, all of their friends are getting married), they panic and pick the next guy, any guy who comes along, often with disappointing consequences…It wasn’t until later in life, when I started seeing this happen to lovely women I know that I realized how true and sad this was….The second lesson came up when I was struggling with my decision over turning down a proposal: I was very much in love with an absolutely wonderful guy who at the time seemed like a perfect match. Unfortunately, during our relationship we discovered that we had big differences in our life values and beliefs. (I’m not talking about different tastes in music, I’m talking about huge differences over life-changing decisions and core values). The fact that he was funny, smart, kind, handsome made it so hard to accept that he and I could never compromise our core values and it would be a mistake to choose him as my life partner.After I finally took the painful step to end our relationship, I had pangs of doubt daily and could not stop thinking “what if…”. My Dad once again shared his wisdom: “Look at it this way Lucy, let’s say you’re building a bridge and you need 100 bricks to reach the other side. Even if they were the loveliest bricks made of gold, if you had only 99 they would not be enough - the bridge would collapse. However, if you had 100 good strong bricks, you have a solid bridge. Over time, you can polish it and strengthen it and it becomes something beautiful too.”Again, it wasn’t until I had met my husband and finally had a complete “bridge” that I understood what my Dad was saying. Although at first it didn’t look like the perfect materials for a bridge, over time we reinforced it together and ended up with something spectacular that will stand the test of time.

Been in relationship for 8 years and married for 6 years, and here’s what I can say:Marrying a person who’s vastly different from you: Because, opposites attract, right? No. Compatibility matters. I’m not talking about things like ‘I like romantic movies, while he likes action movies.’ I’m talking about things like ‘I like spending lavish amounts of money on shopping, while he believes in saving money for a rainy day’ or ‘I believe that it’s okay to get fat, because there’s only one life and we should be able to eat whatever we want, but he believes in staying fit and eating healthy’ or ‘I don’t want any kids while he wants 3–4 kids.’ If you think these are tiny differences, watch out, because these kind of differences will come back and bite you later.Not completely sorting out the past: There are thousands of posts on Quora asking ‘I can’t forget my ex even after marriage, what should I do?’ Or ‘My ex is married to some person, but now she wants to come back to me.’ Why is this happening? Because of jumping from one relationship to other without completely sorting out the past.Marriage is a big decision and should be made only when you’re completely sure about your feelings.Not including family while making the decision: If, at the beginning, you feel that your potential partner is not a good addition to your family (whether it’s because he doesn’t treat your parents/siblings well, or because his values/beliefs are vastly different from your family), dig deep into that feeling and find out what’s wrong to determine if it’s a deal breaker. Never underestimate the influence of your family on your relationship and vice versa. Your family and your partner are significant parts of your life and they should be able to respect each other.Assuming that marriage will change a person: If you think that marriage is some holy grail that will change your partner, abandon that idea. In fact, marriage significantly amplifies the negative in a person. If you hate smoking, and he/she’s a smoker, there’s a good possibility that they’d resume that behavior, even if they’d quit it for the sake of wedding. If your significant other has some issues you absolutely hate, think twice before marrying. Nothing, not even love, can change a person. Change has to come from within.Assuming that a person will not change: At the same time, assuming that the person you married is the person who will be in the next 10 years is the biggest mistake you can commit. Circumstances change, people change. Life affects people in different ways. If you’re going to get married, get married knowing that the person will grow, will change, and that’s not going to stop you from loving him/her. To be able to love them, even when you hate them, will help in the long run.Choosing for all wrong reasons: Are you marrying the person because he/she looks good, or he/she’s wealthy etc? Then the marriage is doomed to fail even before it began. And finally,Ignoring the importance of chemistry: Sometimes, when things are going really bad, I think it’s the only thing that keeps the relationship alive. It’s not just sex, it’s being able to laugh together spontaneously, not taking each other too seriously, and the feeling you get when you look into their eyes and somehow all the years melt away and you’re with the person you fell in love with.You just know when you have that chemistry with a person.While it’s a long list, I also suggest you not overthink the decision. Usually, when you find the right person, the decision is easy. You don’t feel like reading these answers at all, even though you might want to check in once, just to be sure. You feel like you know it’s right. And most importantly, there’s no drama. You feel like you finally found your home.
Story Time:India is a country where love marriage is a taboo, not taking metro cities into account. But unfortunately, this story belongs to a metro city, Delhi.I have a friend. When she turned 24, her father started looking for a groom. She was in a relationship with a guy who was her childhood friend.Her dad being an orthodox strict guy, didn’t approve of her relationship in a different caste. Even though the guy was well settled and belonged to a good family, he got rejected.Finally, her dad found a groom for her. He had a job in MNC, his family was wealthy and he had some onsite tour. 10 years of her relationship died when she was forced to marry this guy. And, her parents’ explanations were:-He is working for a Software giant, what else do you want?He is good looking, what else do you want?Look at his family, they are wealthy. What else do you want?He is not addicted to alcohol or smoking. What else do you want?We will always look forward to your better future. We will never choose a bad groom for you.Well, they made their point. What else did she want?Before marriage, they did the essential background check of his family. Once they were convinced about groom’s family being genuine, they approved the marriage.They got married and went for their honeymoon like any happy couple. After 10 days of marriage, that guy started showing signs of depression.On the 27th day of her marriage, he committed suicide.Story Over.Ah! you must be thinking I left my story in the middle. Of course I will let you know the complete story.After his funeral she came to know:-He had another wife in Mumbai. Even his family was not aware of it.He was addicted to prostitution. A broker contacted him on his Whatsapp with photos of new girls after his demise.He couldn’t handle the new environment of marriage, all freedom gone. And thus he took that extreme step.Now my story ends here.Now, coming to the question. What common mistakes do people make while choosing a life partner?Well, a country where you have no freedom to choose your life partner. Then, what am I supposed to say?If you live in a remote area of India, you will see that Indian parents cannot compromise their fake stature in society.They can sacrifice anything to maintain their status. They won’t hesitate to put their kid’s future at stake.Love marriage with other caste or religion will lead to your boycott by the society. (Keeping in mind, I am talking about entire India. Don’t forget to add “Khap Panchayat” of villages).Now, in such a situation what common mistakes do they make?They check family, earning, background and groom. But they don’t bother to check his/her character, irrespective of gender.If bride and groom’s family are compatible, then they don’t bother to check whether their kids are compatible with each other or not.Most of the times you will see, if the guy has any irresponsible habit, their parents assume that after marriage he will change. But what if, he doesn't ? Then life becomes hell for those women who marry such guys.If you have not given the right to your kid to choose his life partner, then while choosing for him, don’t just look for family’s background. Because, after marriage they will be the ones to live together their entire life.My friend is a widow now, her life was over in just 27 days. How is it justifiable? The person you know for a months is better than the person I know for 10 years ?Think what is more important. Your image in society or your kid’s future?
What are some common mistakes people make when choosing a life partner?
When choosing a partner I make two mistakes.I expect, and I assume.I expect the person I want to marry is who I think they are. Who I think they are and who they are might be very different, and that is not their fault.I expect my perception to be reality. My perception is instead my perception.I expect the other is responsible for making me happy. (Heck. The other person isn’t even responsible for making me coffee.)I expect the other is to blame when something goes wrong. When something goes wrong I have been wronged, and I’m the victim, right? I mean, how could he?I expect I can in any way control or affect the other person’s behavior.I expect love to be something I have already experienced and hence already know. I’m looking for that, for my version of love, rather than for what love can be.I expect the other person to save me.I assume this choice of mine and I speak the same language and are therefore understanding each other.I assume my feelings (and his) are never going to change. Everything changes. Even what I want to have for breakfast.I assume the other person’s reactions to me have something to do with me.I assume that internal fissures happen for external reasons (such as loneliness, restlessness, anxiety, anger) so when I look for the fix I look in the wrong places.I assume this will be forever and that if it isn’t, if I made the wrong choice, all can be made right by making another better choice. If only it were that simple.

The following are considered taboo, yet they must absolutely be mentioned. As of my writing this response, I have not seen anyone else mentioning these.Naive understanding of“love”The contemporary idea of “love” - with the sparks flying and all, sudden surprise dates, adventures to a destination on the weekend, etc - dies off really quickly when you see the person every single day, even when they’re not dressed up or particularly in a good mood. This isn’t real love, it’s more of a love-lust.When it naturally begins to mature, many people misinterpret this as “oh no, the love in my marriage is dying”. That’s incorrect. This is a sign of the marriage stabilizing, maturing even. Your love evolves from “I love you so much” to “fasten your seatbelt”, “I’ll clean the dishes”, “Sure, you parents can come over”, and so forth.Lack of empathyMost marriages fail because one partner or both are inconsiderate. They only care about what they want and don’t put in effort into understanding their partners wants and needs. What exactly am I talking about? The husband who wants sex, but doesn’t consider about his wife’s sexual needs (such as her climax). The wife who wants a new car, but doesn’t consider how much her husband has to work to afford the payments. In such scenarios, both leave their spouse unhappy since they never truly put themselves in the others shoes.ImpracticalityThey say “love is all that matters”, and as long as two people love each other, it doesn’t matter what anyone else says. Well, I’m here to burst this nonsensical bubble. No matter how much you two may say it to each other initially, the opinion of the parents, siblings, etc matter. The difference in educational levels, careers, culture, and yes religion do matter. The mixed couples who dive in head first without considering these critical issues often fail. It’s completely fine to marry someone from a different world, just be sure it’s practical. For example, if you’re an Asian guy and her family hates Asians with a passion (say, her dad got his arm torn off in Vietnam or something, and irrationally blames all asians for it), do you really wish to spend your entire life trying to convince them otherwise? Do you really want to deal with them all the time, knowing they may never truly appreciate you? Sure, maybe they’ll become enlightened. But may they won’t. It can go either way.Does she live in Warsaw, Poland and you live in Washington, DC, USA? Does she have a Doctorate while you’re a gas station clerk? Are you a Black guy and her grandfather is still in the KKK? Are you a Jew and his family are Evangelical? Practical considerations matter. If you have such issues, talk to your partner at the start to establish mutually-agreed guidelines.If you avoid these three major mistakes, you will have a superior marriage and life. Goodluck to you all!
I married a man of my choice against all odds. But made some common mistakes while i chose him. Currently we are separated learn from mistakes not repeat them.I married the man while I was doing my masters. : Never compromise on your education/or what you want for yourself.His parents did not agree, so we eloped, I flew down from UK to India to get married in court(without his parents knowledge) and went back to complete my studies. :A man who is not honest with his family will never be honest with you. The way he broke his parents trust to marry me, the same way he broke my trust and abandoned me. People do not change!!! Don’t ignore red flags.Took money from my parents and never returned it. Had a lot of debt, bad CIBIL score. lied about credit card bills.Never paid for the car or two wheeler we had!: Check how he handles finances. A man who cannot manage money and gets it for free is very difficult that he will ever learn.He drank and smoked too much. Addictive nature.: Watch out for people who cant do anything in moderation. He could drink after he threw up and a bottle of whiskey on his own was so easy!He lied about almost everything: Compulsive liars can never be trusted.He was a narcissist and selfish. Watch out for people who care only about themselves.: when you are choosing a partner sharing, having empathy for the other person and being able to accept the other person as your own is very important. Its not I anymore, its US/We. If your career is not as important as his not worth it. yeah
What's the most common mistake people make when choosing their spouse?
Considering I loved and lusted after my guy for a long time before we finally ‘became one’ (snicker), my advice is going to sound strange. I would say choosing someone who loves you rather than the other way around, is a good option.Think about it; The Little Mermaid suffered agonies from unrequited love. So did Cinderella until she snagged her man, and then only because she had a foot so tiny, she could never implant it in her hubby’s butt.He’d just wonder what that little sting was where the moon don’t shine.Our deepest desires, fairy tales, rom-coms, and dramas are built around unrequited love, longing, and yearning; the agonies of jealousy when they choose someone else, or the heartbreak of losing the loved one when they marry Another; the self-esteem issues when they don’t love you as you love them.Sigh. It can all be a big bore.If, on the other hand, you pick the guy who loves you, and your feeling about him is, “He’s okay, I guess. He works hard, he loves me, he’ll be a good dad, and as long as his looks don’t ruin my appetite every morning over breakfast, I’m good to go.”Because of course, if you loved him, his looks would be moot.It seems impossible, but your love for a man may fade with time. Maybe even before the honeymoon is over.But this guy with the long twirly mustache, top hat, and awesome black and red cape, who demands of you that “You must pay the rent!”, and you reply, “But I can’t pay the rent!” is a man to think twice about.Dastardly Dick is willing to go through all kinds of machinations, shenanigans, trials and tribulations, just to win your love. He won’t ever succeed, but you won’t have to worry about the rent. In fact, with community property laws, YOU can be the landlord, too.Because what was Handsome Harry doing when you were packing your few moth-ridden possessions, wrapping your raggedy shawl around your head, putting on your shoes with the holes in the soles, and wondering how you’re going to survive that blizzard outside?Busy rescuing everybody else, is what.Edit: This is just an opinion, people. Choosing this option doesn’t mean that you’re ‘settling’ unless you feel you are. It doesn’t mean you are selfish, abusive, and you and your spouse will ultimately be unhappy. It might happen, but it might not. It’s just a thought, an option for engaging in marriage. It’s not a blueprint for disaster.Edit the Second: Please limit new comments to thoughtful ones, and leave the accusatory remarks at the door. I’ve heard them all by now, and if I get any further ones, I’ll report them. Thank you!
There are few mistakes that will cause massive trouble, yet some stand out.Failing to understand what ‘life partner’ meansSince the early days of our relationship I’ve been telling my wife: we’ll get 100 together, then marry and afterwards we’ll look at the sun sinking in the sea. We got married before we were 100, yet this dedication of getting old together remains. And we are both old enough to know that we will indeed see the sun sinking in the sea, life will end sooner or later. Darkness will follow.Considering the past instead of the futureHaving a life partner means you should always look at now and tomorrow. Having a great past together is not sufficient, it’s all about seeing a future together.The day after our first date my wife (to be) and I were having a deep conversation with the topic: what do we want, what do we expect, what if this does not work out, what do we do then? We always aimed for tomorrow.Having incompatible ways of problem solvingVery often people in the start of a relationship forget that trouble will come one day. Weeks or years later they find themselves struggling with the way the other wants to solve problems. When the shit hits the fan it can mean the downfall of both.Being compatible in solving problems does not mean agreeing on execution, it means seeking to understand what is the problem and why a certain solution is proposed.Having incompatible valuesClosely related to problem solving are values, the underlying reasons why we do things or refrain from them. For some these values originate in religion, for others they come from a certain worldview. Even when not sharing a religion, sharing similar life values can hold people together.Not seeing that it’s circumstances that change, not peopleI once told someone: given the right circumstances any person will cheat, but not all people allow these circumstances to rise or to persist. You cannot change your life partner (although he/she can do this to some extent) but you can change circumstances. Yet this influence also has it’s limit, certain life events happen and create difficulties. At this point look ahead, know you have the same values and agree to solve the problem one way or the other.Thus far I have focussed on aspects of the relationship, yet I like to mention one extremely important mistake not all people realise:Not realising you are your own life partner as wellThere will be one single person in your life who’s with you your entire life: you.All prosperity and all misery will be experienced by you and nobody else. If you are not happy with yourself you might fall in the trap of seeking another to fill the void. And it will cause even more misery. When you are happy with yourself, or better: content, you will find that you can be a source of happiness to others as well.You should develop every trait you expect from a life partner as well. You should know yourself, your outlook on life, your values, where you are heading.When you know yourself, one day you find someone who’s heading in the same direction with roughly the same speed. The two of you adjust just a little and decide to tag along for the long run.It’s only when you share the same destiny and the same path that you can tag along with each other as life partners in this journey called life.And there will be plenty of people walking along for a brief while as well.You meet as strangers, some will leave you as strangers, others as friends and few won’t leave till the end. That’s what you are aiming for, someone who’s with you for the rest of your life. It’s a long journey with many obstacles and beautiful sights. And a sunset at the end.When you are not content with the journey ahead you are not ready for a life partner. When you are content you will one day meet a person heading for the same place by the same road. Keep moving forward, alone or together.
What's the most common mistake people make when choosing their spouse?
The most common mistake is choosing a taker instead of a giver.A taker is someone who absorbs energy, favors, love, compliments, and attention from other people, but doesn’t return these gifts.Givers take pleasure in giving of themselves to make others happy.In high school, I dated a girl who was a taker. She was hilarious and fun a lot of the time, but she constantly wanted things and was always asking me to drive her here and there, or help her fix her car, or burn her a CD, help her move, help her study, and so on.As a giver, I was happy to give and give and give. But eventually I noticed that, despite giving constantly to try to make her happy, she rarely returned such gestures. Eventually we broke up.Shortly thereafter, I started dating another girl. Immediately I noticed that she was so much easier to be around. She also gave me the love, affection, words of affirmation, and quality time that I so desired.But it wasn’t until a year and a half into our relationship that I realized exactly why my new girlfriend was so incredible.She called me one day to ask me to pick her up from the mechanic’s. Her car had broken down and she wasn’t able to fix it on her own, so she’d hobbled it into the auto shop and, after being told there would be a four hour wait, decided to call me and ask for a ride.What I realized was that, after a year and a half of dating, this was the FIRST TIME she’d asked me to do ANYTHING for her (she might be a little extreme in her independence. Don’t hold everyone to this standard).We’ve now been together for eight years and married for five. Every day we have a great time because we spend our time giving to each other, working to solve each others’ needs.So determine to be a giver and find a giver. By giving to each other, you’ll both be fulfilled.

Do you regret being in any relationships?
Relationship with the boss!!I have been in a relationship with my boss for 3 years. In starting, it felt awesome. We used to work together, chat all day(professionally) and night. Even sometimes we used to hangout, movies, long drives, sex in car and office after working hours which were the most romantic memories till date.I even stayed in office on Saturdays every month to spend the night with him. He was the first one in my life to whom I lost my virginity. I was in love with him. He was kind, caring, loveable and good looking. What attracted me the most towards him was his hardworking nature and his love for his family ❤But the worst part came when he started behaving rude and angry all the time because of the work and family issues. Even when I was not wrong, he used to shout on me and abuse me. Due to this, my colleagues started making fun of me like she is a loser, she can take anything from boss, blah blah..That took toil on me till the end of 2 year. That time I decided I can't take this anymore. I used to cry in bathroom, in cab and all night. I think cab drivers could easily recognize me because it became my behavior of sitting alone and crying.Due to all this, I was shattered. I was not able to work the way I used too. I lost all friends. I quit the job, ended the relationship and whatever I had for him. Even after quitting the job, he threatened me to rejoin. But I guess when a girl chooses self respect over anything then nobody can change her or make her to do anything else.Moral: Never ever be in a relationship in your office. Be it your boss or your colleagues. Never!!!Small Edit : When a boy or a girl chooses self respect over anything, then nobody can get him or her to do anything. It's not just girls. It applies to even boys as well…

Will I ever get over the regret of destroying my relationship by cheating?
This is the kind of Quora question that almost pleads for the response to be, “No, because I learned something/became stronger/was a better person because of a relationship.” However, my response is yes.There was one relationship that I wish I’d never gotten into, and if I had the chance to turn back time knowing what I know now, I would have never gone on the first date with this person. He wasn’t serious about us, but I didn’t know that. He had no intention of marrying me or anyone else, but told me a bald-faced lie. The entire relationship was a waste of time—a fraud. And I ended up being someone’s “friend with benefits”, never knowing that there was no future in it.I fell for a player, but he was a very good player. He must have been doing it for a very long time.When it ended, I had learned nothing about myself. There was no life lesson. I became a lesser person—angrier, bitter, more fearful of men and relationships. Now, when I date, I automatically wonder what that person wants out of me.Even though I knew that what had happened hadn’t been my fault in the slightest, I kept looking for ways to hold myself accountable. No one likes to be a victim, and no one would choose to be a victim, given other options. So yes, I dearly, deeply, and still bitterly regret it. It’s the only thing that I would change about my life, if given the chance.
It might be trite, but I really don’t. The one thing I do regret is staying too long. We all see the signs, the red flags…but we forget. Somewhere between the kisses and the roadtrips and endorphins, we forget.The first time, I was seeing someone after a major breakup that impacted my life far more than it should have. So there’s this guy, he’s caustic, but he’s also interesting. He also inspired a couple of dreams with enough symbolism to make Jung and Campbell happy. Yeah, I didn’t heed any of that. It wasn’t until I bumped into an old friend while on a date with this guy, where my friend took me aside and asked me “What are you doing, do you even like this guy?” Turned our I didn’t like him very much, I was just really afraid to be alone. So after some thought, ended things and proceeded to be alone for a while.The second time, the guy was charming, and we had things in common, and soooo much fun. I was with him because I like him and not out of need or fear. But he had baggage. Which, let’s face it, past the age of twenty five or so, we all do. This package came in the shape of a daughter and baby mama. Disclosure time here, I genuinely encouraged him to go and work things out with the ex if possible, when we first started out. He claimed that it was over and no… Glossing here a bit about family dynamics, and shall we say, omissions on his part. One day we’re chilling in his apartment, and on the radio, there is this thing about how every family should have a prearranged spot where to meet in case of a natural disaster/attack. And that’s when I knew, I’d wait and he’d never show. He’d be with his “real” family. It was a lovely summer fling which I don’t regret, I just fooled myself into believing it could be more.
Do you regret getting into an relationship?
Marriage is brutal.I’ve been married to my beautiful wife for less than a year now, and marriage is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.For example: I couldn’t have sex with my wife for months after marriage. How’s that for breaking the newlywed stereotype?She is the most beautiful woman in the world. I desired her. I wanted her. But unresolved baggage from my past prevented me from, well, completing the deed, we’ll say.There were times during that struggle that I regretted getting married, because I didn’t think I was good enough. I couldn’t give her what she needed.And if I’m being totally honest, I probably regretted it for selfish reasons: “If I hadn’t gotten married, I wouldn’t be dredging through this crap from my past.”She later confided in me that there were times when she thought, “I wish I hadn’t gotten married so young. I should have taken the time to travel. Then I wouldn’t be going through this rejection.”But we fought, and we fought hard. It was an uphill battle of prayer, forgiveness, community, and a whole lot of heart work.We’re on the other side of that battle now, and I’m more in love with my wife than ever. And I can say this: It was worth it.There may have been times when I regretted my choice, but they were fleeting; few and far between. And nowhere near as strong as the regret I know I’d feel if I’d let her go, or never married her in the first place.She’s my best friend, my partner, and my wife. Marriage is brutal. There may be regret from time to time. But I wouldn’t have it any other way.On a final note, I was in a handful of long-term relationships before meeting my wife. Shortly after some of those breakups, I probably would have said I regretted the relationships.But with hindsight? No. Those relationships, even the bad ones, shaped me into the man I am today.Want a little more on marriage? Check out Connor James Drake's answer to I'm struggling to keep respect for my husband.

Do you regret being in any relationships?
i believe every relationship can be beneficial in the sense that you can learn things from them: learn from mistakes you made and better understand what you want from a partner.but man, my last relationship was a mess. it took me about 2 years to get over my first love then i started dating this guy. it was long distance, met him on twitter; he was only about 4 hours away though. i honestly didn’t find him attractive, he had zero personality, he wasn’t intelligent, wasn’t independent in the slightest, he is 21 years old but does every single thing his mom and younger sister tells him to do, had a porn addiction, had no ambition in life, no social life, played video games 24/7, and his only friends were internet boys that jacked off to hentai all day. his family was insane. his sister was neurotic and was constantly screaming at him in public. his mom was genuinely a narcissist. we had almost nothing in common. i tried to break up with him in the very beginning because i knew we weren’t compatible, but he would have an emotional breakdown every time and guilt me into staying with him. one time i did it and blocked him on everything so he couldn’t reach me. the guy drove 4 hours and waited in the lobby of my college dorm until i came out by chance and forced me to talk to him. we ended up getting back together that day. i ended up staying with him for about a year and a half, but i was completely unhappy because i knew the relationship was going nowhere. i just convinced myself to stay with him because he was “nice.” but he wasn’t even nice. he was emotionally unstable and would have fits. he would tell me he hated me, etc. he was also incredibly insecure; thus, making him very clingy. i’m an introverted and independent person who enjoys my alone time, but he would text me nonstop everyday. it was slowly driving me crazy.anyways, a couple months ago i finally bit the bullet and broke up with him. i did it as civilly as i could and told him i just wasn’t my happiest in a relationship at that time. but of course, it was extremely messy. he spammed me with texts for days. i had to block his number. he spammed me on all social media, including my email. i had to block him everywhere. he would message me telling me how horrible i was, how i was an evil woman, how i was the only person he had and now he had no one and it was my fault because i tricked him, this was all apart of my evil plan, he just wanted to die, etc.during the summer i stay at my parents’ house since i’m a college student. and then he showed up there, which is 6 hours from where he was staying. he forced me to talk to him again; he said, “i need you to break up with me in person.” i said “okay” and did just as he wanted. i broke up with him in person and then he started sobbing and the guilt-trips started, but i was just so over it all. i listened to him go on for about 2 hours and then finally told him goodbye, but he still wouldn’t leave. he knocked on the door for god knows how long. i had to open it because he wouldn’t stop, then he wouldn’t get out of the doorway. i literally had to push him and slam the door shut, just to get him to leave. to this day he is still finding ways to message me and tell me how horrible of a woman i am. sometimes i feel kind of scared because i know he’s not emotionally well. if he snaps, i think i’m the first person on his hit list. women die at the hands of the men they rejected pretty often nowadays.so yeah, this was kind of a way to vent out my frustrations, but you get the idea. i kind of wasted a year and a half of my life in a pointless relationship because i couldn’t handle the guilt of hurting someone’s feelings, and i’m still dealing with the verbal abuse to this day… i mean, i guess i learned to not settle for a guy just because i think he’s “nice” but i’m not sure if that lesson was worth it yet…
No, I don’t regret because no matter what it was, at the last it will be kept within us as a memory . I have been into a serious relationship where i was in a situation in that , the breakup didn’t hurt me the most but the attachment nd the habit of talking to her daily was the most difficult thing for me to get out of that. But if i think about the positives that i got from that phase is I became the poet for the few initial months. And i started reading books to keep myself detached for her. and now i feel proud of the things that came out just because of her. I wouldn’t be a kind of a person what i am today. 
Do you regret being in any relationships?
Yes,the first one. They were selfish and arrogant. They dumped me because I wouldn't drop everything when I had a mate over to stay,then several months later asked me back out. Everything whilst being with him was on their terms so I said “No.” this time. They would ring me up drunk at times. They told a mate of mine that we never even went out. When we were going out they would try to chat up other women. I dumped them first then decided to go back out with them,of which I had to grovel for,only for them to dump me a week later. When they decided they wanted to go back out with me they got two boys to come to the house to ask a relative of mine if I would go back out with them,couldn't even come to the door! The relative said to me that they wanted to talk to me outside, so I said that I didn't . They came round one night before that when I was in bed and a relative told them to go away. Another time before that they rung in the early hours. They left a voicemail. I listened to it,then ignored it. Ever since then if they see me in the street,they ignore me. It was 21 years ago! They mistreated me,not the other way round.
Did you regret your relationship?
No, I will never regret the time we spent together. Looking back, I realize it was the best time of my life. We would spend nights together just talking or laughing about things in life that mattered to us. From the other’s friends, and family’s, to things we saw. When we were together, we would look at each other, and try to get the other, to laugh. At inappropriate times, because we knew we were both thinking the same thing. We would finish each other’s sentence’s, she would tell me exactly what I was thinking and I, her. I’ve never had that with anyone else in my life, and never will again. I lost her because she needed me to be the man she believed me to be, but I was my own worst enemy. I stopped drinking but it was too late, she was gone. Do I regret our relationship? No, I regret being the jackass who lost her, not the man she fell in love with. “What fools these mortals be” Shakespeare said that hundreds of years ago, all I did, was prove him right-
Well , I did.I was 17 years old when I have my first boyfriend. I was at high school,medicore student-i guess. He was 24 years old universty student. It last 3 years. We were completely obsessed with each other. I stop caring about my life, my future, my goals and school. After 3 years, I won universty exam but honestly I could do better. Then we started talk about marriage. It is when I see that I did not want to get married. I did not want to have an ordinal life. I left him but trust me it was not very easy. He threaten me with suicide, used emotional abuse on me very well. This made me cold hearted towards any guy later. I stop believing “love”. If it was only thing I lost my belief of I would be okay... But I also lost my belief on human emotions pretty well too... When someone sad I only think they want attention. Someone crying ? They are useless, weak human beings and it is all fake.I do not think I am guilty because I left him after 3 years. I am very happy I did. Imagine you find out after marriage how wrong your partner is... Worse with kids...I regret that I had relationship with a guy – far older than me at this age. I wish I had waited at least for universty. I would act differently, choose differently – I guess. But it is an experience at all. It made me wiser.I am 25 years old now. I still do not believe human emotions. I only trust one emotion and it is hate. Hate is not an emotion that people would like to imitate, but love,friendship is. So it feel like more real than other emotions.

Why is married life better than a single life?
Married Life is Not better than single life. It is actually the total opposite.I'll lay out the reasons and you decide for yourself which is better.Being Married:It's a partnership and a life time commitment.Everything you want to do has to be discussed and agreed upon with your spouse.You have added responsibility once a child comes along.Sex maybe consistent at first but then it starts declining.There are times he or she will drive you up the wall.Your happiness is dependent upon the other party.You give up all your freedom.You have to meet the in-laws and get to know them. Let alone, accept them and them.. You!Being SingleYou are your own boss.You get to choose what you want and when you want it.You can build yourself a really good life. Study, Travel, Build a business.Your happiness depends on you.You can travel with a group of friends and not be bombarded with questions later about what happened.. (in Vegas)Yes, sex may be random at times if you are promiscuous. As long as you get it when you want it. I rather you wait..You have only one responsibility.. You, and maybe your parents.There is no need for a second opinion.You can choose who you want in your life.You have all these people to choose from.Yes, you maybe lonely. But I am sure you'll have friends and family.You can go back to school.You can do anything.Okay, perhaps I am being biased. There are pros and cons to being married or single. The thing is, remaining single for a while is a better choice. You don't want to be married and then get divorced in the next 2 to 3 years.It's better to save yourself all that heart ache before it even begins.Just my opinion!

There is nothing better in this world. It varies from the relationship status of that person.A Married men envy on the freedom of single men. While a single men worry about not having a companion and envy on married men.Pros :Single :Less financial troublesYou are the boss of your life . No need to answer to anyone and no nagging.Less expenses, more savings , early retirementDue to no responsibilities , you can take risks in career at any timeYou can date anyone , party all night ….More social lifeWith all your time at your disposal you can focus on the career or personal development.Married :You will have a caring familyYou will lead a disciplined lifeYou don't have to live alone in your retirementWith a stable partner, you will have good sex lifeMarriage makes a man more patience and confidentSurvey reports states , married men are less prone to suicide and depressionWhen you are ill , your partner will take care of you.Cons :Single :You will be alone in your retirementMore prone to suicide and depressionWhen you are ill, there won't be anyone to take care of youYou don't lead a disciplined lifeWith no stable partner , you will resort to random hookups or sex workers which risks your lifeMarried :If your partner is not compatible, you will have a miserable life . If you end the relationship, you need to pay big chunk of money as alimonyYou won't get enough personal time for your hobbiesRequires more income to live . Savings would be less due to more expenses unless your spouse too workingTakes long time to retireWith the burden of responsibilities, can't take big risks in life.Social life would be small as you will be engaged with your family time.
Single.You don’t need another person or sex to make you happy.History is full of single celibates who have lived joyful and fulfilling lives. As far as sex goes, you can actually be far happier without having sex or any other form of intimacy. Why? Well first of all, imagine being in a state of mind when you are never happy because you’re always craving something. Second by second your mind is agitated because it’s thinking of getting something that it currently doesn’t have, and the fact that you don’t have it is driving you insane. This is what life is like when you’re so preoccupied about having sex. You just keep craving and craving after it the whole day, and throughout all the time you’re thinking about it, you’re not happy at all, in fact you’re miserable because you keep feeling the frustration of wanting something that you can’t have. When you do get it, what happens? Maybe 15 minute of enjoyment only to resume this vicious cycle of agitating desire?But then you might ask, well how can I be happy then? My answer is, there’s something even better than sex or whatever joy you would find in a relationship. You might be thinking, how is it possible that there’s something better than sex or the joys of a relationship? Well, there’s a reason celibacy and spirituality go hand in hand. When you live a spiritual life, you begin to reconnect with our original source (known as the Divine, God, Allah, Jehovah, Krishna, etc.). In reestablishing that relationship, you start to feel an intense feeling of ever-increasing bliss that makes sex seem totally insignificant and unsatisfying. Imagine being in a state of mind where you are totally happy all the time, and nothing can take you out of that because you’re getting your happiness from inside rather than anything external (money, drugs, sex, etc.). It’s incredibly satisfying and will make you far happier than making yourself frustrated thinking about sex 15 hours of the day and then only getting maybe 15–30 minutes of enjoyment out of it at the end, or constantly being in anxiety because of all the mouths you have to feed. The pursuit of this lifestyle is infinitely more rewarding than any superficial relationship you may have.Moreover, it’s just a burden to have to be accountable for the needs of other people. Being single on the other hand is incredibly liberating and allows you to live a much less stressful life. Plus, while we do have a basic need for companionship, finding a group of friends is a much better way of fulfilling that need than a relationship. With a marriage, you have to deal with another person all the time and you don’t get a chance to get any time for yourself. When you find other friends, it’s great because you get a better form of friendship without any of the hassles that accompany a relationship.Look at him, he’s a single celibate, does he look unhappy to you?So basically yes, you can live a perfectly happy life single. If you wanted to read more about finding fulfillment from within rather than from anything outside of yourself, I’d recommend reading this article or this reading list. Good luck with your search for happiness. Hare Krishna .Sources: a previous article I wrote here.
What is better, married or to be single?
A2AWell both has its Pros and Cons…singles believe that married life is better and married people think the other way round …If you are a person who gets gets irritated even over little things, if ur damn selfish and always believe in self love-self gains and requires too much of personal space better be singleLets make a check listIf you can eat burned rotti and salty curry once in a while with a smileIf you have the heart to share the chores and play with the kids for sometimeIf you can be committed to ur girl and to ur childrenIf you can consider her problem yours and ur kids problems as ur own and can be there whenever they need youMy dear you as a married person can be happy- it’s always the little things that keeps a family moving forward- there can be exceptions as wellNow on the other sideIf you are a perfectionist and want all things to go as perfect as you areYou plan to marry bcos its time or that’s how it is or say bcos society will question you… pls dontIf you are a very busy person and ur carrier and self growth is alone important, multitasking say family and job can’t go hand in handIf you think kids can be annoying, hard to change diapers; u hate ur house being messy then pls don’t even think about…they love messy things - even a neatly combed hair is seen as challenge to be taken up.If you think sorry and compromises are words not necessary and needs to be only used by ur spouseMy dear pls don’t get married bcos married life includes lots of sacrifices- sharing and caring from both the partnersFinal NoteYou might be a wonderful person, love kids, eat burned foods and extremely caring and sweet person but that again doesn’t mean you have to get married. After all marriage is a label. Are all married couples following their vows and are all singles really being single???If you feel the need- if you feel so-if you think you as a married person is more of complete person and being single makes you feel like u miss something…then its time to seek someoneSometimes one decides to stay single forever but again one fine day you could also wake up missing your heart…chase after the person who stole your heart…and your story and path just changes….Let things happen on its own… :-)

Why single life is better then married life?
I won’t say single life is better, but you will have different experiences in life. I think you can achieve happiness either you are single or married. However, you certainly have more responsibilities when you are married.Life is simpler when you only need to deal with (care of) your own family. That is, you won’t have the conflicts with in-laws.You don’t need to adjust yourself to develop a new rhythm with other person. You don’t need to compromise.If you are single, you make decision on your own. You don’t need to consult the other person. You can follow your will.Your time is only devoted to yourself. You don’t need to spare some time for your spouse, your kids or your in-laws.Financially, you spend your salary on yourself. You don’t need to save for your children.You can choose / quit your job freely.You don’t have the responsibilities for your spouse and children.You have more time, more freedom.No one complains about you.You can date whenever and whoever you want.
What would you prefer, staying single or marrying someone? Why?
Living the life of a single adult orphan in India-Bhaveen Sheth-DOTSIM-Indian MGTOWOrphans have never had it easy ,especially in India.Children without parents grow up being neglected, uncared, unloved, exploited and unwanted.Some children become orphans at the time of their birth while others become during some phase of their lives.Losing your loved ones at a young age is not easy and combine that with no support from near relatives, life is indeed difficult.As a writer of this blog titled as "The diary of the single Indian male", I would like to share my own experiences living the life of an adult orphan.Now at the age of 35 , I have very much accepted my destiny. I don't know if I will ever find a soul mate.What is it be an adult orphan in India?What is to live a wretched or cursed life? In the words of the famous Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky "Hell is living a life without ever being loved or being able to love someone". This statement sums up the lives of adult orphans. Yes, we adult orphans are living a life of hell.At my age life has become a sort of routine: wake up, get dressed, go to work, come back, read books, watch movies and go to http://sleep.Am I not a human being? Don't I have any feelings?There are times when I wish that there was that special someone by my side. There is a wish to see a wonderful smile of a caring woman in the morning, but there is none. Empty rooms is something that I have always been coming back to after work.It has been so many years where I have had only loneliness to greet me.Initially it was difficult, now I have got used to loneliness.As an adult orphan in India, you are pretty much on your own.You don't find much support in the society. There is no one in whom you can confide in, no one to share your feelings.A solitary life is forced upon you.What is it that you miss as an adult orphan?You miss the human touch. Something that makes you feel http://human.It can be a hug, an embrace, a face to face interaction , anything that shows someones love towards you. You have no one to feel for you.Whatever feelings you have just get stored into you for years to come.The society deprives you of a soul mate just because you are an adult orphan.When was the last time you loved someone and she reciprocated her feelings? This is something that a majority of adult orphans are deprived of. A difficult life filled with hardships makes you pragmatic. You are not able to understand the fantasy of love that other normal people have. I guess, we adult orphans are too realistic with life. But that does not mean that we cannot love or care for someone.There are times when we want to have a meaningful relationship, there are times when we wish to be a part of a social gathering, unfortunately we have been denied This an adult orphan you have to live the hard way and accept certain bitter realities of life.Being single post 30, you are bound to face ostracism, criticism and acerbic comments. Not being married after a certain age marks you as an odd man in the society. A single man post 30 working at a good position gets noticed by people.You get commented upon for your single status, people feel that there is something wrong with you. You don't want share your personal problems with anyone and if you did, no one one will empathize with you. Social isolation is something that you have to face.No one will invite you at any social function.People tend to forget that you are human being.Marriage is an integral part of life for everyone. Everyone gets married other than orphans.For adult orphans, the doors of marriage are closed.Your education, work, designation and salary does not Matter - Magazzini automatici does not matter that you are a self made man.All that matters is that you should belong to a decent well cultured family background. Hence we, adult orphans are nowhere possible suitors for a http://marriage.No one respects us for what we are. A few months back , a woman's father spoke to me and said "You have no parents, no relatives, how can I believe that you belong to a decent family background" As simple as that.And if you get a matrimonial interest, it will surely be from the dejected and rejected category of women who otherwise have no takers. It seems that people take our orphan status for granted and try to dump their unwanted daughters and sisters on us.Not a day goes by when you think why your life turned out like this.You question your destiny and faith in god.Why is a normal life denied to you when you have worked so hard?Why are you treated so differently? There is no answer to this. Your life is empty and you feel left out.And still in all this gloom, sadness and stoicism you see a ray of hope.You realize that if you have made it here all by yourself, there is a possibility that you will go far ahead. There is a lot more that you can do and lot that you can achieve.You work on yourself everyday in order to become a better person.You work on building wealth. People who understand you become your best friends, you develop good relations in the community.You immerse yourself in creative activities.You travel solo in order to explore new places and meet new people. At the end of your life you don't want to look back and have regrets.Lastly you don't give up on hope and strongly hold on to it knowing that one day there is going to be a positive outcome.This is Bhaveen Sheth signing off for the day and promise to be back with a lot more.BHAVEEN SHETH
This has always been my topic of interest and I have always wanted to discuss this at length with people. However, people mostly decide to chicken out of such discussions because they are scared of the truth.I will answer this question to the best of my ability and try to share my experiences of looking at singlehood and marriage from a distance . To answer this, I would like to categorise humans aged between 25–32 in the following categories :-Happily single with no desire to get married- A lot many of my friends are single and never bring up the topic of marriage . Their families are liberal and don't pressurise them to get married before a certain age . They are enjoying their singlehood and are very open about their activities like dating and getting to know different people .Single but desperate to get into a relationship/get married - You will always find them frustrated and on the hunt for women. They don't care about the person, his traits, compatibility or anything. They just want to get married or get into a relationship immediately .You will find their profile on http://Shaadi.com and they will be on tinder to find a life partner . Very difficult to talk to such people as their life revolves around marriage, job package and related topics.Committed but waiting for the right time to get married - My cousin is 32, works in the Beaurea of Indian Standards ,has a girlfriend for ages now, but for some reason they aren't getting married. Such people are probably waiting to get posted in the same city before taking things forward . Good people but a breakup at this age could spell doom.The “family will decide our husband/wife” type - This is mostly prevalent among certain communities in India . They will date as much as they can before marriage because they know the final decision has to be taken by his/her parents.I clearly remember a classmate who broke up just before leaving university after being in a relationship for three years. The reason she told me was “ultimately gharwale hi thik karenge “ . Extremely obnoxious, but very much prevalent in our nation.So these are the four broad types into which I can categorise people. Now , I will give out my personal opinion on marriage and singlehood and also relationships because I genuinely feel that arrange marriages are a farce and the most hypocritical thing that Indians do. It's more of a social arrangement than anything else.Marriage according to me should be done after giving a lot of thought behind it and the consequences that might follow. I personally believe that one should get into a relationship , followed by a live in relationship to know how good their compatibility is before taking such a major decision. Unfortunately, people pay more attention to issues like caste, family background and religion which are extremely trivial in front of compatibility and the ability to look twenty years into the future with your partner.Its high time that people took marriages seriously because, often, failed marriages have a huge impact on children and the entire family is affected by it. Don't get into a relationship, or get married because you feel lonely or you feel like you need a partner now. That's never going to result into something proper. Get married when you are at your mental and physical best , when you know you are ready and can give your level best into a relationship.I hope I have been able to bring out my opinion clearly :)Affairs and related issues are on the rise today and I believe that no one deserves to be cheated. Let honesty prevail and let there be happiness in lives :)
Single vs. married life, which is better?
Thanks for A2AThis would be interesting to answer.The single life …independence , freedom, me time, dreams, passion, goals and above all not being answerable to anyone. Just too perfect!It is like sitting on a swing, gently going back and forth,at our own pace,at our own will. Want to go higher…touch the feet to the ground and push and here you are…soaring and touching the skies , feeling wind in your hair,on your face ..Want to slow down…stop pushing,just let it be. You will come to a halt.Your life, your pace, your journey ,your destination, your freedom and your responsibility too. It is the stuff dreams are made of…The Married life…independence, freedom ,passion, me time ,dreams ,goals but with limitations, with constraints , always choosing one thing over other.It is like a roller coaster ride. You buy a ticket, you sit,secure the lock and you​ go.Slowly at first,then touch the heights,higher and higher, the stomach churns, heart beats faster, you shreik,scream, you feel scared and wish you didn't sit in the first place… just when you feel you can't take it,it becomes slow again.It picks up the pace again and this time you manage, you know what is coming, you tightly hold your partner's hand and enjoy the sharp turns,twists, and the sudden drops.Then it finally stops.You feel secure,happy, breathing normally, glowing after the heady rush of adrenaline and you want to do it again.You are no longer fearful. You are ready to take many more such journeys. It's fun, it's happiness,it's sunshine,it's breeze.You just grew, you just discovered what you can endure, you just became confident after each round of hardships.At any given time,my choice would be the exciting, the scary, the spectacular, the unpredictable roller coaster ride we call marriage.With all its constraints, with all its limitations, in all its splendor.
Is it better to be alone or to get married?
Well, it depends on individual needs and perspective. Personally, I think marriage is a decision, which when taken at wrong stage or by choosing a wrong person, will hamper your life badly in many years to come. Let's consider arranged or love marriage. You don't know that person beyond usual likes, dislikes, hobbies etc. In arranged marriage, you 'think' you know these things because that other person told you so, while in love marriage you get to know these things as you spend more time with the person. Now consider that you get married to that person based on this 'knowledge' about him/her. Now comes the twist, when you meet a person with the view that the person in front of you is a potential life partner, you always try to project the best of your personality. You hide negative things about you, like bad habbits, addictions, lazyness and what not! (nobody yells or behaves arrogantly on a date). But some things can only be understood when you actually live with that person 24/7, and split the finantial, emotional responsibilities. So the moment of truth comes, when your spouse stars to show true colors (being married means he/she no longer needs to project 'best of him/her', since you are not going anywhere away from him/her, being 'tied' by marriage). Problems start with petty issues, like who will store water in the early morning, or what clothes will you or your spouse wear to the party, or who will walk the pet dog, or who should clean the house on holiday, or should the parents/family live with you or away from you, should the holiday be used to go on a picnic or to enjoy long cozy sleep. And believe me, these problems or let's say 'difference in opinions' seem small but lead to fights, mood offs, serious issues in the marriage. Secondly consider the worse case scenario that you understood that you have married a wrong person. Getting out of a failed marriage (splitting, divorce) requires a lot of mental strength, even more if you already have children in that marriage. I've even seen cases where husband and wife don't even talk to each other, but haven't divorced just for the sake of children or fearing social reaction to their decision. In such cases, life of the couple as well as their children is ruined, just because of wrong decision of getting married. I think the proper way to deal with this is 'trial period' or live in relationship for some time period. In that period, the couple can live together, share responsibilities and see if things work out. During this time they'll get to know each other inside out, positives, negatives, views, political-religious stands. After such 'trial period', if the couple thinks that they are compatible with each other and are ready to spend lifetime together, they can get married, otherwise they can move on without the complexities of emotional or legal problems that would've arised had they been married and opted for divorse. Either way, marriage is a risky decision and in my opinion, consequences of failed marriage outweigh consequences of successful marriage.(sorry for any mistakes in English, tried my best!)

Do single unmarried women in their 50s regret not having married or having kids?
I'm 52, never married and from the time I remember I didn't like or want kids.  I wouldn't trade my life for the drudgery and negative drama of a marriage. The suffocating albatross of children and their neediness, noise, chaos.Not all women need other people to define their self worth. I am aweome all by myself.

Have you ever regretted never marrying?
It is human nature to want what we do not have. Those who married and had children also regret their choices. "Why didn't I stay single and free!" A person who wishes they had done the opposite is viewing the other choice as perfect --my child would have been perfect, or I would have jet-setted all over the world if I didn't have kids and a family to tie me down. They do not imagine that their child might have been a defiant, hateful, drug-addicted high school dropout. Or imagine that the carefree single life might have left them dating pilots who fork over money for abortions like coffee money. Yes, everyone wishes for the perfect life not chosen, including single childless women in their fifties.
I have to be anonymous as I'm not sure how my comments will come across my friends who are on this site.I’m very happy to have made the choices of not getting married and not having kids.As a result, I’m well-traveled, well-read and have many good friends. I know and love myself. I’m successful in my career and generally healthy. I’m able to give time and money to things I’m passionate about.I don’t think these can all be possible in one lifetime if I got married and have kids.

Human psychology is such that we want what we don't have and don't appreciate what we do have. For example, I had a childhood dream of having a fair enough internet connection and playing games on websites like Cartoon Network or Pogo. I wanted it very badly back then. I used to request my elder brother to take me to cyber cafes to titillate myself with these websites and once in a while, he would agree to take me and I would fool around on the internet. But then I got a broadband connection at home and slowly, this fascination began to wear out. I realized that there's nothing more special in it than, say, sitting in a comfortable chair and reading Sherlock Holmes. Needless to say, now I don't even visit those sites at all which were my dreams a few years ago. Same goes for wanting toys. Same goes for the desire for an iPhone. Same goes for needing a partner. Though, it's comforting in the beginning to have someone caring for you but then again, I believe our psychology kicks in and the fascination wears out eventually. People generally don't find their partner that scintillating after 3 to 5 years of marriage, so far as I have observed.You wrote, "You don't feel it now, but when you're older and your siblings are busy with their own family, you'll be lonely." Now that's not necessarily going to be true. Rather than attaching yourself to a person, you could keep yourself engaged in a pursuit, i.e. a goal. You could learn mountaineering, scuba diving, watch online lectures on history, physics, French Revolution, programming, attend dance and music classes, read excellent literature classics or do whatever interests you (which you otherwise wouldn't have much time to do, if you had family or kids). That way, you'd be engaged in worthy activities and won't feel lonely. Loneliness is, after all, a state of mind. You can even feel lonely if you're sitting in a crowd, if you catch my drift.

Never.. I am happy on my own! I love myself fully and i dont need another half to complete me and rather want someone as a whole! This Era is filled with the hype of being in relationship and there are supporting dating sites and social platforms where u encounter ample of profiles suggesting u a partner to fill the so called "void".. thats for those who are lonely and cant enjoy life! I have been on my own since years and mostly  independent along with friends and family to love and support me through thick and thin.. my happiness solely depends on me In my opinionNobody can love u more than You coz You understand yourself better than anyone !!
Ahh.. question seems to have perception of yours, your mom's, and on that your asking others that being single is regretful ?May be, what she is trying to say that you will miss few awsome moments of life by being single.I am not saying being single will ruin your life, or will take away joy etc. hell no! its freedom that you are enjoying, loving and wanting to live same way.however, if you see from her eyes, she saw you growing which is best part of life one can ever experience! to see cute sweet little kid entering in your world and making you say We from I!  when your hungry, probably you will go for maggie at home or pizza ordering, but its nothing as compared to mom's hand made paratha's full of love & ghee too ! ;) .you feel joy of presence in family when you have others in life as part of your family.to find friend in form of husband, to share your views, to get motivation from them when you yourself feel doubtful about what you doing!I personally feel, life is all about living with others, to share happiness, joy, to help each other.Nothing is perfect in life, relationships,people, nothing, but its commitment we show in it that makes us different, positive and strong and unique from others. your mom is telling you to see all this to experience all this in life.And last but not least, there is nothing called marrying wrong guy/girl.think 10000 times before jumping into it, but once your in, dont give it up so easily.cos if you say person is wrong, then mind you, you are wrong too since you selected him/her!Just a perception! do think about it ! afterall, we all need jaadu ki jhappi! :)
She is probably right from a very practical point. I am 28 as well, not ready to get married any time soon, I have a friend who is commitment phobic too and we really love each other (but don't want to get confess it, yes, we never spoke about it), so officially I am single. I don't regret any of it but, some how (weak moments you know) I feel the need of someone when nobody will be around. Parents wont live forever, my sister is already busy with her family. I don't get to meet my friends every weekend.Yes, to have somebody to spend your holidays (where you know he/she will be there no matter what) that would be nice. The feeling is nice. But the phobia of commitment kills the joy. So no regret!

Is there anyone who has regretted being ‘old’ and single and 'living your life' because everyone told you it's okay being single?
I am 30 yrs old and single. I do want to settle down at some point and almost did when I was 27. But for whatever reasons it didn't materialise. So not going in any further details, here is in nutshell my learning from life so far: Each one of us has a different journey in life. We are not in school or college anymore where everyone has a single goal with a timeline; pass the class the same year. Life is a much bigger and grander affair. Do things that make you happy right now. Pursue things you want to right now. If you don't feel like settling down then don't. Especially for a big decision like marriage, the worst thing you can do is to marry for the wrong reason! If ever you meet the one and feel like getting married then do! Else stay single. Whatever you decide to do, make sure you live a life true to yourself!
I am rather happily married for 32 years now and fully endorse your mother's view. If you are not committed to something, which requires you to remain unmarried for the time being, you are wasting your time. To remain unmarried is not an achievement, without some specific purpose. Marriage is not a burden, it is a social responsibility and it gives you everything in life-- meaning, purpose, fulfilment. So be serious about it, before it is too late.Turn a new leaf, start a new chapter of life and you will enjoy it, will be benefited by it. Best Wishes !
No, I never regret being single.Being single is the best part of life since you are independent. After certain age for eg after 32-35 you need a partner to move forward in your life.Being single you can do anything you want, u never feel jealous also. You can do anything you want. When your workloads increases you needs someone to make you relax,to make you happy, to be with you entire your life, to support you and at last at your last stage of your life you need someone with whom you can spend time happily.
I'm 33 & single and for me, not really. That's not to say I don't get thoughts of wanting a life companion or a family, especially when seeing friends in moments of marital & familial bliss. But those thoughts are fleeting, and are readily countered with "Thank god I'm not in THAT relationship" when seeing friends in dysfunctional, manipulative and even abusive relationships.But more importantly, I'm a fairly spontaneous free spirit - and the idea of constantly checking in on where I'm going or what I'm doing seems stifling. On a similar note, I don't feel the need to be updated every time my S.O. wants to do their thing. So while I'm open to the idea of a relationship, it will likely be a paradoxical-sounding "let's be together... separately" one.And like others said, do what makes you happy; if you decide that you do want a significant other later in life, you can easily put yourself out there in search of one.
No, atleast not yet. What is there to regret? Tesla in his old age felt that he should have accepted the proposal s he had at his disposal of a potential life companion. May be a sense of rejection may stem out, a feeling of not being compatible with the construct of the world around us. And after that there is nothing to feel bad about. Our parents did their 'job' of raising kids to the level of self sustainance. Now they expect us to do the same which is not bad as we have a social fabric to maintain. There could be a regret like a cone of ice cream that you didn't try, and we the monkey see monkey do humans feels bad when we are not acting like the other monkey. So don't take a decision just because you feel that you'll regret not taking it. Take your time. Good luck

What are some reasons people are single?
What are some reasons why people are single?
Let's make a checklist for all the essential things to get committed and the challenges in each step. (More suited for an average Indian guy)Interest in a relationship :- A lot of people are genuinely not interested in/aware of  a relationship up to some age. Deeply engrossed in higher studies , career , financial commitments etc . Heard of noble gases ? Yeah , they don't fucking bond with anything so easily because they are so complete and self absorbed.Time :- Okay , now you feel its time to start dating , but do you have time for that ? Are you in a job that sneaks into the nooks and corners of your life ? Is your course too demanding of your time ?Contacts :- Okay now you have interest and time , but where do you find girls ? The most common ways are school friends , college , workplace. Now some people could have studied in a gents school . College or workplace might have an unfairly skewed ratio of 1 girl per 50 guys e.g Reputed engineering colleges and Reputed Software MNCs ( Nothing misogynistic here , I am just giving my observation ) And just so you don't tell me about HR dept, Let me tell you something  "One simply doesn't mess with the HR Department".Expectations :- Okay , luckily you happen to know some girls you can reach out to. But do they meet your expectations ? You are so awesome (at least , that's what you think ) that most of the girls you know don't match your expectations in some way or the other. And you are too nice/decent to hit on random girls or send "fraandship requests" .Courage/Drive  :- Okay , you have finally narrowed down on a girl who matches everything you are looking for. What next ? Make romantic advances to her ! Did that just send a tingle down your spine ? Understandable ! Are you too lazy to initate ? Understandable .Skill :- Okay , now you have finally mustered some courage/drive and take a do or die approach . Good ! Now start talking . Sure , let's talk about .... mmm ... uhhh .. oh crap ! what will I talk about ? Availability :- Okay , you have the necessary skill and you are just too good at smooth talk. You initiate the conversation and become an instant hit. You connect so well , that she tells you about her boyfriend !! BAMM . You hit the wrong girl son !Friend zone :- Okay , she is not committed. You talk for hours , you get to know each other . But you know , she just thinks of you as a good friend. BAMM . You prepared Maths for a History exam dude !! Mutual Interest :- Okay , she doesn't friend zone you . But she rather does not want to get involved in relationships either ! She likes you but won't love you . Because her family is orthodox , about to be engaged , does not believe in relationships , different caste/religion etc.  BAMM . Dead End !!Commitment :- Okay , everything is fine. She is kinda falling for you . Mission Accomplished !! Now what ? Propose and get committed. Whhaatt ? The mere word "commitment" sends me on diarrhea for weeks. I am not ready for commitment yet !  One girl for years ? OMG !There you go ! See , It is not as easy as it sounds ! It requires a blessing from heaven to get all 10 steps aligned ! Screw up at any step and GAME OVER . Start the game all over again .From my experience , I have seen most guys blocked and fumbling around at the third or fourth step itself.It more or less feels like this

Why are so many decent people single nowadays?
Why am I single?
Several reasons but one needs special mention:They want to be single!Being single bestows upon them the below-mentioned privileges and more:They may decide to stay home for the weekend doing nothing, nothing at all! No message or call can change that decision. No one to give justification to.The freedom to say ‘NO’ is all theirs. They don’t need to do anything unless they really want to do it.Solo trips to any place, any time.Abundance of time to work on things that matter (priorities)Being broke for a long time doesn’t hurt.No judgements. There’s no one who is trying to bring them ‘up’ to the standard.Nobody expects them to behave in a certain way or behaves erratically if they don’t behave that way.Not to forget, the freedom to appreciate (check out) the beauty of the opposite sex and the ability to be friends with several of them.Sure, most of us have to give up these privileges some time in our lifetime, but what’s the hurry? And yes, I’m happy for those who have found the one for whom they have done it already. I hope it’s worth it :)Being in a relationship (ideally) brings physical and emotional happiness. But have we explored all the possible ways of reaching the same state? (Hint: food, nature, travel, hobbies, or even work)A lot of us find it scary to spend time in our own company, an underrated source of happiness (no kidding :P). Since when has it become a ‘thing’ to be in a relationship after a particular age?Several are in a relationship just for their physical needs, letting their partners dream up a future which will never come true. Who are they kidding? Openness can go a long way in keeping physical and emotional dependence separate. Better for both involved.Let’s not double up until and unless we’re absolutely sure of the reasons!Cheers :)PS: No, I have not had a history of girlfriends who were control freaks. Peace.
Single?This answer is going to annoy many.See. People marry because they want to have a family. Sex. Children.We humans woo the opposite gender, we say we are in love, then get married and produce children.Then what?Nothing. It continues and has continued for centuries.The same is for other animals too, though they dont get married to produce. They just do it.They woo their best possible mate and reproduce which continues.So, what i basically want to say that we living beings has no role on earth other than continuing our genes.Even if we humans or any other living being is going to get extinct the universe is going to lose nothing.So, coming back to question on why i am single.Since i am already born on the earth, i believe that instead of reproducing i must focus on other thing, because 99.99% of my human race wilk take care of that.My views are:Instead of reproducing i want to help those children who are already born but deprived of basic human needs.I want to spread the truth to people of all countries and all religious groups that since we homo sapiens have brain .USE it. No matter what your religious text says or the laws of the country is. Do not challenge the nature. Do not utilize the resources beyond its carrying capacity. Do not mess with other living creature. LET THEM LIVE. Since they do not have unions, does not agitate, doesn't mean they are useless.Instead of spreading my genes and taking pride of my geaneology i believe whole human race as one. Whether one stays in Nepal Or Canada, working towards betterment of planet must be the sole aim.Limit human population. Share resources. Give to the poor. People born poor have not done anything wrong. It was a mistake by their poor parents. They just did it in lust. Did not think what their children will eat or wear.Stop this nonsense country divide or boundary. If nature doesn't differentiate between countries when calamities arises how we foolish human have the right to make boundaries.I will be back and add soon more. There is very long list… meanwhile. HAPPY GENE SPREADING.
What are some reasons why people are single?
I can't help but say I'm annoyed by responses to this question that assume there is something wrong with single-hood.  Something wrong with the person, else why would they be single?  I know that many single people would prefer not to be, and I know many people who choose to be.  I also know people such as my brother who really must be in a relationship, it's how they are built.  Before my brother met his wife I used to "pray" that if there were a love of my life out there, please give it to my brother because he needs that and I'm fine by myself.  Some people yearn to raise children and while there are all flavors of family and circumstances, I can easily understand why the family minded seek a more traditional framework of marriage to accomplish that.  Why is it beyond comprehension that a person might choose to live independently? Being single is my lifestyle choice.  I was engaged to be married in 1995.  I was with the guy for 8 years or so, living together.  I had other live-in relationships before that.  My former fiance wanted marriage so badly that I tried to give it to him because I loved him.   But a month before the wedding I had to admit to myself I was dreading my future.   When I called off my wedding, I just faced up to it:  I am not cut out to be in a romantic relationship.  I'm extremely independent and I prefer it that way.  I don't like to feel I owe anybody anything.  I am not good at making men feel "needed" (heard that from my fiance and another former live-in lover).  I don't need, and I really (really!) don't enjoy being needed by another.  It makes me feel claustrophobic. I could go on but it strikes me as I follow this question how many people can't fathom the idea that a person might CHOOSE to be single, or perhaps not having chosen it, find they enjoy it.   My life is very full with friends, family, hobbies, and career.  I can improve myself because I have so much time to self-reflect.  There are many responses here to support why a person might choose to be single.  I just don't get how many can't accept this life style.  We are passing gay marriage laws in state after state.  Even if many of us are not gay, we understand that some of us are and have the right to marry and have traditional families.  There are many examples of life styles that are not like the one we choose for ourselves, why is it so hard to understand this one?

What are some reasons why people are single?
At 19, I CHOOSE to stay single because of the following reasons:1. I just got off a bad breakup with my first loveWonderful girl when I first met her but at my age, people change like mad because we are drastically looking for an identity to settle with. Drifted apart to only find out from her sister that my ex cheated on me. I did date several girls after the breakup and got into a relationship which lasted barely for a month. I realised I am not willing and unable to commit my time to a single person after the breakup, which leads on to the next point.2. I love the freedom of being single!I don't have to worry about my girlfriend getting wasted at the club and cheating on my back. I don't have to deal with the quarrels which imo, a bloody waste of time at 19. This time is better off for myself to indulge in my hobbies. I also get to bed several girls without the label of a cheater! (Afterall, we all just wanna have fun right?) Being single gives me lots of time to build myself stronger and honestly, I do attract girls more when I'm single! I don't have to attend to my girlfriend.3. I don't settle for anyone.At 19, I want to meet more people. Every person is unique and talking to them will inspire me and expand my knowledge. I do not wish to revolve my entire world around a single girl because of my intellectual curiosity. I don't want to look back and say: 'I wasted my time with that single girl when I could have....:SINGLE CAN BE AWESOME (except you might feel a little lonely somedays).By staying single, I do what I want and is able to explore the boundaries. And by settling with someone, I get into a comfort zone (Hell no! I wanna push the boundaries and see what I can do with my potential)Despite saying this, I love to be in love. But I want to be in love with someone who I can be extremely proud of, and not someone who I treat as a booty call. And the timing now is not great for me to be attached.HENCE I AM SINGLE!
Many people would suggest how awesome it is to be single and blah blah. But I disagree.I think it’s a choice which we all make based on circumstances.Unfortunately my last relationship where despite having exchanged rings, ended with her being in some other dude’s arm.It left a hole in me that might have filled but deep down I know, I have serious trust issues. I know maybe this girl is awesome, she’s kind, she’s sweet, she won’t ever betray me, but then again the doubt factor.It’s like, yeah I want to share. I want to tell someone about my life. I want someone whom I can call, tell how much happy I was today, how much sometimes I need motivation, but I know I just can’t.I might say i have great friends. The best I know. But then sometimes you know, you can’t share everything with your friends, well at-least not me.But let me assure you, I am perfectly fine. It’s not as if am dying, but the fact is sometimes, Yes I miss the feeling of love, I miss expressing everything to someone. Despite the fact I share everything with my mother but I know she is my Mother and she is not a woman to burden my problems with. She did a great job raising me into a fine Young Decorated Officer and now it’s my job to be there for her.Maybe yes I miss telling and discussing Twilight with some. Maybe I miss being someone’s Edward Cullen. Maybe I miss saying, Always.What is stopping me? Trust issues.I try to resolve it. I seemingly feel am headed in the right direction. I know I will find Love. I have to. It is the most beautiful feeling in the world. It’s an undying flame of passion and love that never extinguishes.Sometimes people have a hard time believing am single. I have to prove it. But those who understand me know why am single. I feel with every relationship failed, we loose a bit of ourselves which once defined us. I lost that bit and that remaining bit is locked somewhere safe for the lady that will grace my Life with her presence.I guess there is nothing more beautiful than Love. Especially when you are with the right person. Everything seems beautiful for when you lie down on the mountains across the grass under the less intense Sunshine, you do find Velvet flowers bloom out next.
What are some reasons why people are single?
I used to have an argument with this ethics professor of mine at least once a week over the difference between a reason and an excuse.  I believe that there is a definable difference between the two.  A reason is a justification for something, an excuse is something you offer up as justification for failure.  You don't give excuses for winning and you don't give reasons for losing.  I hear a lot of excuses for being single, but rarely do I hear reasons that make a lot of sense.  This leads me to a number of different conclusions.First and foremost: a majority of people are not single by choice.  Perhaps you haven't found the perfect person yet, maybe you're "not settling" for less than "you deserve."  Again these sound like excuses and they often are but many people think that making excuses is a bad thing.  It's not always a bad thing to make excuses.  But we take things so personally that even the perception of someone or something being different is enough to send us running in the opposite direction.Second: our standards are too high.  I've been single all my life and I'm pretty sure that this has been the chief culprit leading to the perhaps inevitable break-up of nearly ninety percent of my relationships.  It's like a checklist and if I can't check all the boxes I start souring on the relationship.  I call this the "un-single" test.  If you start thinking of someone as marriage material that checklist gets much longer as you start thinking about whether you'd be willing to spend the rest of your life with this person.  I think as we get older we lower our standards a bit, but whether this leads to successful relationships is a topic that is still being debated.Third: needs are different for both parties in a relationship.  Like I said before I approach dating with a mental checklist and I like being able to check off the boxes.  One thing that I value above everything else is my independence and it seems a lot of times like independence and relationships are somewhat anti-thetical.  Relationships inevitably take away some of our independence, but how much is too much?  I haven't been able to strike the right balance and part of the problem is that I'm a writer so by definition I'm weird, quirky, and I need a good deal of me time to think through my ideas.  At the same time having someone to bounce ideas off of can be invaluable.  Striking a balance is where things get complicated and my feeling is that I'm not alone in having an issue with personal independence and some of the co-dependence that comes from being in a committed relationship.Fourth: what was once cute is now annoying.  We've all been there.  Maybe she's got a great laugh or she flips her hair a certain way when she's talking, whatever it is it's something that makes her unique and that's what we're looking for when we're dating.  But there's a difference between dating and putting together a successful relationship.  When you're dating the little things don't often bother you because you're not around the other person long enough to let those things bother you, but in a relationship those little things get amplified big time and it usually doesn't take long before you identify all the little things that your partner does that tick you off.Fifth: you have different values and priorities.  There was this time in my life where I kind of thought that I could make anything work.  I call this the "Catcher in the Rye" syndrome because we look at the world like Holden Caulfield and tend to think that we can make things turn out the way that we'd like them to.  Idealism is a dangerous thing.  We've got to be realistic.  For instance, I once dated a Republican(!)  and I was absolutely convinced that politics weren't going to divide us but then there was an election and we were at each other's throats.  We had a lot in common and I was able to check off a lot of boxes with her, but the constant blaming of the poor for the plights of the "job creators" just drove me over the edge.Sixth: you have different personalities.  This one isn't a deal-breaker, but it certainly can be.  It's ruined enough of my relationships and I therefore think it's important enough to mention.  Extroverts can be really annoying especially if they try and convert you to their cause.  I dated this one woman who wanted to go out every night of the week and she didn't particularly care where.  I enjoyed spending time with her, but at the same time I need my space as I think everyone does in a relationship, so that obviously didn't last.  However of all the things that people put up with I see this one happening the most frequently.  My parents suffer from this for instance.  They've been married for thirty-one years.Seventh: some people are too clingy.  You know who you are.  I dated one woman who needed to know everything that happened in my day down to what I ate for breakfast in the morning.  One day she asked me to specifically describe the ingredients that went into the making of my omelette.  I tried not to let this bother me because our personalities were so close together and we had so many shared interests.  We're still good friends, but if she brings up breakfast she seems to know that just bringing it up frustrates me.  She still wants to know and I still tell her, but if she starts asking for details I have to tell her that I'm not going to do go through a list of everything I did in my day.Eighth: different visions for the future.  My plan for the future could go one of two ways, both of which I'm fine with.  I could see myself writing full time and living on the west coast or teaching full time and living wherever.  The fact that I don't have a one size fits all idea of the future is enough to frustrate some women who already know when they want to have kids and where said kids will go to school etc.  Needless to say this sets up a barrier that is difficult to overcome.  I like to have options, but I know plenty of people who don't.  I've met women who don't want to have kids.  Sometimes that's okay, sometimes it's not.  I'm not sure if I want to have kids so I like the woman I'm dating to at least have an open mind about it.  Too much one way or the other can cause there to be too much distance between what we want individually and what we want for each other.Ninth: attachment or non-attachment to material goods.  Some people need to have the latest iPhone the day it comes out.  I don't understand that line of thinking, but there are situations in which I'll accept it.  But if the person I'm dating places too much value on material goods then it's probably not going to work out between us because I live a relatively simple life and am happy living a relatively simple life.  Adding a lot of things to my life creates unnecessary clutter and I don't need more things to think about and worry about.  At the same time I'm not willing to live in a van, that's something that is just not in the cards for me.Tenth: different worldviews.  Somebody asked me the other day: "why can't you be happy all the time?"  My answer was relatively simple: depression.  But it's not so simple for everyone.  Not everyone has been diagnosed with depression (although nearly one in four have.)  We all have a unique way of looking at the world and we look at the world from different vantage points.  For instance, I grew up in a middle class family in a middle class neighborhood.  I'm the product of public schools, I've lived in the same relative area my entire life.  If I'm dating someone who grew up poor this can lead to problems.  For starters studies have shown that class mobility can be dependent on who your parents are and how they grew up.  Different people have different experiences that goes without saying.  This also has to do with values and just personal preferences as well though.  Some people place an enormous value on "people watching" something that I've never put a lot of value on.  People behave in the manner they do for any number of reasons, many of which we'll never understand.  Worldview and values are usually interconnected.The Wildcard: (s)he doesn't like to do x, y, or z.  I love movies.  I've always loved movies.  I can't see myself being with someone who doesn't love movies.  Being able to whisper to them: "hey doesn't that remind you of that scene from x movie?" is very important to me.  Other people have different dealbreakers like not liking pets or disliking potential in-laws.  Whatever it is there will always be a drawback to each person you develop a relationship with and they cannot always be overcome.  All in all: Who we love is the single most important decision we make in our lives.  I think it only makes sense to take as much time as you need to make the right decision.  At the same time, making excuses for every little thing that someone does that you wouldn't do isn't always an acceptable reason for being single.  If the reasons that you give for being single are reasons that you have been unable to find a life partner then I would like to reiterate that you're not giving a reason you're giving an excuse.  Some people say: "well, I just like being single" and that's okay if that's the real reason that you're single.  But there are a lot of people who make excuses for being single when they'd like to be in a relationship of some kind and that's not the same thing as enjoying being single.  I'd like to be in a relationship, but I'm not for the reasons stated above.  It's not that I enjoy being single, it's that what I'm looking for in a woman probably just doesn't exist.  Whether or not I'm okay with that only time will tell.
He saw her in college and got excited when he found she is his classmate.Started dressing good to impress her, tried to talk to her directly but not succeeded, Became friends in fb started chatting the whole day, She will wish him before every exams and interviews.He started to like her likes, dislikes, parents, care. Literally he started loving her. Whenever he reads her messages it sounded like she speaking in his mind. Her name become cutest name in the world for himHe started to think about her the whole day, whenever he hears romantic songs he thinks of herSo he tried to become close to her, but she found it is not just a friendshipShe started to avoid him, she replied to his messages very late, her messages lines become very small from “okay” to “k”. She stopped wishing him before exams and interviews. She never told bad about him to any other girls.finally she stopped speaking with him.He got depressed, cried in midnight, ignored studies, started being like idiot but never started to hate her. He lost believe in love and relationships.They become strangers to each other, He started to study hard .He found his parents and career is important than anything else. Even the last day of college they never spoke to each other . he found the difference between love and like. After college He got job.There after he never believed anyone blindly, He decided to avoid getting into relationship again unless it will end in marriage, because he knows how it hurts each other, so he decided to be single.If he/she is trying to remain single does not mean he/she did not got relationship, maybe he/she is waiting for the right one.Thanks for reading,Ranjith
I have dated a few men over the years and realized it’s better for me to be single. Well, I can only speak for myself and what I have learnt is am not good with confrontations and that is a big problem when you are in a relationship. A few reasons why I am single.My friends say that I have set the bar too high and that is why I don’t find anyone and I should learn to compromise. But To what extent. I feel it’s better to be very picky than date the wrong person. (Lesson learnt the hard way)Unfortunately, the few who pass my standards do not seem to think that I meet theirs!I am registered in a matrimony site as my family insist that I should put some effort in finding a guy. But the only effort I put in is to decline the proposals that come my way.I'm a wrong judge of people and I am super lazy. I get a proposal and I am supposed to talk to this guy. I am bad at making small talk. I don’t like to talk for long hours when I am in office, I don’t like to talk when I am watching my favorite serial on TV (Usually its one hour of comedy (Big Bang Theory/2 and a half men). And i have had guys tell me to decide which is more important TV or finding a life partner. And yes, i always chose TV.I don't make much of an effort to meet people. I rather give excuse than go out and meet. I just don’t find the need to get ready and waste my makeup and ironed clothes from my cupboard just to come back disappointed. I have already made up my mind.I am working most part of the day (hardly meet anyone at work), I spend my free time visiting NGO’s. Never a place to meet prospective guys.I'm an introvert (when it comes to things like this). I will not make the first move because the last thing i want is to be rejected. I won’t even say Hello to a guy unless he says it first.And the last but not the least, I have met this guy (my prince charming) who doesn’t even know I exist and I am hopeful someday he will notice me (though we live in different states). May be this is just another excuse for me to stay single. (read my blog for more about this)I found this answer by another person and I found it so true, so am taking the liberty of quoting it here:“Reasons that I might not be entirely to blame for are:Now that I'm getting uhh older, there are fewer single men my age around.Men, in general, are not looking for a serious relationship?Everyone's so busy these days!”

No, I believe the people who are attached to others are weak.I was in class 8th and I had a crush on one of my classmates, After facing rejection from her I felt heartbroken and had lost all of my confidence.There was this girl who lived near my house, we soon became friends. She was of my age and she was quite friendly. When she came to know about how that girl had rejected me, she consoled me and said”It’s her loss and you’ll find someone way better.” I felt really glad somebody understood me and we soon became best buds and shared everything.We would usually stay late in the park and stargaze for hours.We didn’t realize when our friendship grew into something stronger , maybe love. But neither one of us could actually figure it out.But, these things don’t last, one day she came to me, almost weeping. Her father had been transferred to Allahabad. I also found myself , wiping my tears. I asked her” Is there anyway we can make this work? We don’t have phones and parents won’t understand.” She said, “My Nani lives here, I’ll be here every summer and winter break.”By that time our studies for 9th class were about to begin and this seemed the only possible way.Time went by and the summer break commenced, but she didn’t come. One day I gathered up courage and asked the neighbours about it, saying that she had borrowed something.This is when I came to know that she had died of hepatitis a week ago.My whole world fell apart and I fucked up my academics, sports and physique that year. I didn’t tell this too anyone as I don’t want the pity of others, and because it’s too painful. People don’t understand how much pain you have to go through when you loose someone, around whom your whole life revolves.It’s been many years since then, I’m currently in my sophomore year of college.I still look upto the stars but now I feel you’re better single as you can’t get hurt this way.

Not even once!Well, maybe i’ve felt a little out of place when I go to the movies alone, and having others with their spouse doing ‘their stuff’… but i’ve not had the chance to regret it one bit.While I know it’s much better to be with someone, because iron sharpens iron… i enjoy being single. I can give you like 50 reasons, but:I have goals already…. having to add someone is too much work.My resources would be at stake… no +1, equals more food for me.I can be more productive with my time.I don’t have to stress with more details, like, ‘what she wore today, why she said what she said like 12 hours ago’, and all those mind games we can never win.I can go wherever i want, with little or no concern about having to dress to impress.No pressure with future questions like ,’ What are we?’ or ‘Will you stop loving me?’No challenge with watching what she wants for the sake of being ‘boyfriend material’…. i can’t handle that.No problems with trying to impress her over and over again… while being her boyfriend.No problems with dates… No I don’t remember the anniversary of your grandma’s sister’s dog’s death.I can put all my effort on myself, and improve myself much better.And many others.I know these are not valid reasons to be single. It’s more profitable to have someone to improve with….But I’ve never regretted it, for once!
If you have always been single, do you regret it?
No it gives me the confidence to live life on my own terms ..im not answerable to anyone.. don't need to justify my actions n choices.. im not possessed by or obsessed with someone .no drama..no breaking my head for hours on the phone . im free n independence is a required trait .. im detached and in the end its you for yourself ..others may walk on your path with you… but no one can walk it for you I have few good friends to share my space n life with.. and the rest with my mother ..being single is actually a realisation that u don't really need too many people to fend for yourself and survive.. it gives you independence and stability.. n the self sufficiency remains with you even when your so called boyfriend or husband or whatever leaves you.i have had my fair share of hookups n fun but im too narcissistic to let someone else be the centre of my universe..also I feel I need to b worthy of for someone to respect and trust me.. and im not there yet.. im in the making of myself.. to be deemed worthy of some individuals respect.. so it is more important to work on yourself first… no regrets ..I can say with my head and standards held high.. ofcourse I can make exceptions if the guy looks like Nick Bateman or Brad Pitt.. ;) but that's a different story
I've been in love twice in my life. Understanding the meaning of true love with one of those relationships. I've also been in relationships that I regretted entering on day one, as I knew it wouldnt work. After finding love that's deep, lasting and meaningful and then try to replicate prior feelings within other relationships, I've learned to stay single until I find another person that lights my soul on fire once more. Is there a possibility that I'll be single forever? Yes. And I'm ok with that. I'd rather be single than be with a person that's wrong for me, or that doesnt ignite my spirit. You can't really regret being alone if there isn't a partner for you to walk the path of life with.

Do you ever regret being single for a lifetime?
I have many friends who are single and perfectly happy. There are many who are very unhappy with their life.The whole issue depends on what you want from life. Many due to their circumstances, family problems, cruelty by partners of their siblings, not interested to share their personal issues, take a decision to remain single. Many sacrifice their entire life for the benefit of family and welfare of parents.There is a friend of mine who says that there is plenty of milk available, then why buy a cow? I am not agreeing with him.I am a happily married man touching half century.Many wants no responsibility of running a family. They lead a care free life with no encumbrances.
If you have always been single, do you regret it?
I have been single for a year now and I don’t regret it at all.My previous relationship was toxic for the both of us, and I ended it.I only got better as a person and so did she, so there is nothing to regret.

I can't say, but I can tell you something I KNOW for a fact.You will regret being married to the wrong person if you rush into a marriage, "just to be married"Contrarily to what a lot of people will tell you, you don't have a "married by" date.  If you are worried you aren't meeting enough people, maybe ou should get out more and take up some hobbies that you enjoy for their own sake but offer the opportunity to meet and interact with more people.Do ge out and be social, make more friends, get more in touch with and develop your love of self.  Live your life to the fullest but don't stress about being married by X date.  The more you are having positive interactions with a variety of like minded people, the higher your chance of hitting it off with someone but don't push it or youll seem needy.  If your not interested in marrying anyone, then likely you've just never met the one who makes you reconsider.  Be open to relationships when they come but again don't worry about it.  If you're single and happy, content, then its not an issue.  I would suggest trying to develop as many good friendships as possible still though so that when you get older you will have close friends and not feel lonely.Everyone has different social needs.  Don't burn bridges but don't worry if our own don't necessarily follow the social "norm"

I've written about this in another answer but I am adding more! I don't know if I'll ever get married but I was supposed to be getting married in December, but I called it off. I loved him and I trusted him more than any single person on the planet. I suspected things, and I know for a fact that I am a very intuitive person, but he always denied everything I would try to bring up and solve. He had to go away for a while… we have a daughter together so he's only seen her twice since the last month. He told me he didn't want to be with me because he needs to focus on himself but he had also spoken about a girl that he'd met 'at this place' that sounded… out of the ordinary for him. I knew what was happening but I didn't want to believe it. He would never do that to me right?It turns out that I ran into a mutual friend whilst out and about whilst my now ex was at his house with our daughter so he could see her before going back. This mutual friend told me that my now ex is seeing a girl 'at this place' and added that my ex is not only into women… which I also knew but didn't want to admit to myself. He refuses to confirm nor deny until I tell him who it was that told me this and got in his car and left. I told him if he loved or even cared about me in the slightest he'd be honest with me, and didn't. I know he would've said no if it weren't true. He ended it with me to work on himself but is now dating a girl with a whole lot of her own issues, and couldn't even inform me. Our rule was if one of us started seeing someone we'd let each other know also because she share a daughter and want to know who the newcomer is in her life. I asked him if her name was… the girl he'd mantioned before, and I saw the look in his eye and I knew. I had a melt down. I cried, I sobbed, I begged just for an answer and he refused. My heart feels like it's torn into a million pieces, but imagine I had married him and then years down the line, find out he isn't the person I thought he was.So in my case, I do not regret not getting married.
Will I regret not getting married ?
Someone saw a man wearing his wedding ring on is middle finger…”Sir”, he said, “you are wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger”… “Yes”, the man replied, “I married the wrong woman!”That, of course, can go both ways… “I married the wrong man, or in our new world, “the wrong partner”.In my younger years, if you not married by a certain age, something was wrong with you. I was coerced into getting married to a woman I knew in my heart was not the right fit for me. She would have been a perfect fit for someone else, but I could feel in my gut that it would be a rocky road ahead. She had an affair, our first year of marriage and while I tried to keep my wedding vows of “better or worse”, it just got worse and twenty-years later, as my health started to deteriorate from the stress I separated and later filed for divorce.Today, the odds are against you that your marriage will survive for the long-term. If you are happy in your life and enjoy just hanging out with friends with the occasionally added benefits, then keep doing what you are doing with no guilt. You get to use your money and your time to your bidding without anyone else dictating your life. One billionaire wrote, when discussing financial decisions…”if floats, flies, or f…s…then rent it!” Somewhat crude, but perhaps accurate…

Will I regret not getting married ?
You may not regret getting married. But only if you're not marrying the right person. I am a firm believer that when you get married you should be getting married to someone that you want to be with till the day you die. And that means well until your 93 even if you make it 200. Marriage is supposed to be about committing and spending your life with someone that you love so much you could never imagine going a day without them. So unless you feel that type of bond and relationship and dedication to someone it's better not to get married. A really strong marriage is probably one of the best things you can ever experience in your life. But it only works if you meet someone that you literally feel you can't live without. It also makes it easier when you have such a strong bond to weather the ups and downs of a marriage. Everything will marriage will have its good times and its bad times. But what gets people through the bad times is the love that they have for the other person and the willingness to work out whatever issues have come up because you value them and love them so much.

Yes! I was very immeture! My siblings were all much older than me, & did not play with me! No neighbor kids! No school kids came home with me! I grew up entirely alone! My father was in the hospital, & my mother worked to support us! Got my first real job at age 27, & had my first real date! Nice girl who tried to put some moves on me, but I was too ignorant to recognize her signals, so she moved on! Another girl waited 13 years for me to return home, & died 2 weeks before I was going to propose to her! I went on to live 50 years without a wife, kids, Or sex! I have major regrets! When I was 12 YO, an 11 YO girl offered to have sex with me- I was SCHOCKED, that someone so young would consider having sex, & declined! I have often wondered, if I had accepted her offer, would it have made a major improvement in my life! Bless You, Betty! Bill
Will I regret not getting married ?
How can a stranger who doesn't know you answer this? I don't even think your best friend can answer this. I don't even think you can answer this until you are quite old and on your deathbed, unless of course you regret it much earlier.Just live your life and if you don't get married, you'll find out, and if you do get married, then you won't.
Will I regret not getting married ?
I have read back cover of a book written by French writer (I don’t remember his name). The main idea of his book was that “the biggest success someone can achieve is not to be rich, famous, powerful, but to own a good family”. He was comitted suicide in a hotel room at approximately his seventies. He also was an unmarried writter.I think most elderly unmarried people feel regret at the end of their life. Because having a family, children is a source of joy. Unmarried people lost such an opportunity and there is no way to turn back again.Also all living creatures naturally need reproduction.If you think that I will live or hang out with diferent people in different periods of my life, most probably, especially if you are a woman, there will be no one with you in your hour of need. You will be capitalised in your prime, and then you be left to your fate at least sensually.Think again.
Do you regret never marrying?
Never, not even for an instant. My partner and I have lived together for almost 33 years now and raised two, now grown up, sons. We still love each other very much and plan to spend the rest of our lives together.Why do we need the church and the state to tell us we're allowed to do all this?Most of our friends who got married are now divorced or separated. Most of our children's classmates were married - and divorced. Ours was the only intact partnership in either of our childrens’ high school classes - for seven years running!Marriage … it’s just a piece of paper folks. Commitment? That's quite a different thing.
Do you regret not getting married?
‘Do you regret not getting married? ‘To me personally, just the opposite, I regret getting married, three times. All my marriages ended up with divorces, and ALL three times, in various degrees, is because my former spouse stole from me, lied to me, cheated on me, and then ran off with another man. I have become very cynical about this whole marriage institution.

Is 30 years old too late to get married?
There is always a right time to do a task in life.For example,Start school at the age of 5Complete education by the age of 25, so as to start earning and get settledGet married at the right timeIn your case you're already 30 given that you are not ready to take the responsibility, so let's put up a possibility scenario -Let's say you'll be ready to marry in 5 years at the age of 35And considering a late case scenario let's say you're getting arranged marriedIt will take at least a year for you finding a girlThe problem in finding one would be that you'll either get a girl not of your choice or a divorcee (not that these women are not better but I'm thinking on a general Indian mentality)You'll get married at the age of 36Let's say you'll get settled with your wife in two years, now your age is 38 yearsYou'll plan your family at the age of 39-40 (consider a round figure of age 40)So now, when your child will be in -Class 1, you'll be 45Class 5, you'll be 50Class 10, you'll be 55Graduation, you'll be 61The purpose behind this calculation is that, you'll be too old when your child will be an adult.Your child will have parents which are the age of grandparents of his generation.You might enjoy your bachelorhood till as many years as you might, but once think about the future I narrated to you if you want a future like that.Good luck with your life.

Please don’t rush into getting married. I am telling this out of personal experience. At the age of 27, I was not financially stable (Though my parents were really well off and owned a couple of flats in metros like Hyderabad and Pune). They registered my profile and I started looking for matches. The first three matches didn’t go through and I was a bit dejected. My father started applying pressure on me (Saying that because I am not financially stable, no girl will marry me or that I am good for nothing).I was getting really worried and when finally a girl was interested in my profile, I said yes to the match.This turned out to be a huge mistake as I had rushed into this decision without much thought. There were a lot of things hidden from me before marriage and finally the marriage ended within 3 months.Now I am financially stable, make good money (Almost 4 times what i used to make at the age i got married). If I had waited, maybe the circumstances would have been different.It’s always better to wait for the right time than to rush into something and regret it later on
You were young and beautiful at early twenties.Many handsome and rich guys were behind you at that time.You could have said 'yes' to any one of those guys. But you didn't.You could have enjoyed life with those guys going on bikes and cars, partying like other girls. But you chose a different path.Something else was running in your mind.While other girls were busy making boyfriends, you chose to stand by your mom who was effected by cancer and was battling with life.You joined a job to make up financial needs, giving up on your own desires to do masters.While other girls were busy inviting to their marriages, you chose to be a parent to your younger sister.I should tell, my respects for you was doubled.I feel pity for that guy for missing on wonderful girl like you, who chose to walk away from your life without understanding you fully. How unfortunate it is, for one to walk away making an allegation that you didn't give time. Why didn't he understand that what you were going through. Why didn't he understand that you have not lived a single day for yourself.You thought a lesson that each person's life is different and they have their own boat to sail. If someone goes ahead of you doesn't mean that he is successful and I am a failure. It just means that you are facing a tougher tides on your way. It only makes you a better Sailor eventually.Last week when you turned 30, there was no such excitement in you. I felt like you had that pain of missing something. But you had that satisfaction.The satisfaction of standing up for the family and having the courage to postpone your own desires for their sake.After cutting your favourite cake, you came to me and asked , "I am getting old Rahul. Will any guy would ever marry me" ?I looked into your selfless eyes. At that moment i just felt,one should be lucky enough to marry a girl like you.At that moment all that I could say was, "I love you. Will you marry me?"
Well absolutely not ! As Chandan Singh mentioned, most Indian women in today's world have huge demands because marriage to women are for convenience. The basic idea for women planning to get married are - social security, financial security, a sense of dependency in critical instances etc. Companionship never mattered ! So with rise in financial level and quality of life demands of majority of the women have skyrocketed. And they expect you to satisfy all of it and not talk or crib about it ever. If you feel you need to land yourself up into such a position of disarray, to be acceptable by some of those women then buddy you need to rethink ! Because there is minimal chances that your efforts would ever be recognized and appreciated whole heartedly. So this brings you to the situation where you need to question if at all marriage is necessary as a man !! right ? Well necessity might arise in the long run and in older age. Also the emotional vacuum leaves us men in another vulnerable situation. So you need to weigh this out practically.You claiming that "getting married after few years" may just be another thing that you say to procrastinate the process. Maybe you think that you would look around for a few years and once you're 34-35 maybe you would figure it out that its easier to stay alone and bypass the entire marriage horrors ! Right ??? because that's exactly what i think. I guess it isn't late. But the end result isn't to get married. The end result is to stay happy and stay in peace. If you're sure that once you balance "avoiding marriage" and "loneliness" and if "avoiding marriage" wins, then better work on getting rid of marriage plans and work on broader stuffs like charity etc to improve humanity. If "avoiding marriage" loses then better start the process.
I am a 32 year old female in India. Is it too late to get married?
Is 30 too late for a man to marry?
Is it possible for a girl at the age of 30 to get married in India?
Is 31 years old too late to get married?
If you are not married at 30-years-old, would you be worried?
No, absolutely not. There is no upper limit to the "right age" to get married, unless you count senility, due to its problem of preventing informed consent. I don't think you'd be senile at 29.The older you are, the more likely you are to end up with a woman who has been married before. This isn't really a problem, but it's a reality you need to acknowledge.Having said that, there are plenty of women who remain single into their 30s in order to pursue their careers. There are also a fair number of women who are willing to marry an older man - and the older you are, the wider the age-gap that becomes acceptable. By the time you are 32, few people will consider a woman of 24 "too young" or a woman of 36 "too old".So don't be pressured into marrying before you are ready. That's a certain recipe for making a poor choice.
You will receive n number of answers to not to marry based on just age and so many other stuff. I will give you practical answer which might not be pleasing to some people. Please do not forget you are in India. No matter how much we say that we have advanced, we are deeply pathetic when it comes to marriage related things. Mindset of boys, girls and parents are still same as it was before. The parents want to marry off their daughter with a well off boy maximum by age of 28 or 29, earlier it might be 22 or less but today parents are generous enough to let girl do her stuff till 28. Please not that all this while they keep searching for boy and get her married once he is approved totally. On boys side, they want a fair well educated girl and as soon as they fine one, marriage happens. In India age beyond 30 raises eyebrows, try it on shaadi website and very first curious question will be, "ohh ab tak aapne shaadi kyun nahin ki". This is silly because person asking question itself is late in getting married but they have apprehensions ki kya problem hui hogi. Ofcourse caste system, mangalik, kundly matching etc add insult to the injury.  Therefore my dear, you are late in getting married to a good girl. Your chances of getting your dream girl have already reduced and you will compromise a lot if you get late.
People get married at different ages as a matter of choice. As such, there doesn't accurately exist the ideal age for marriage although people do feel that anytime between the ages 25 and 30 is the best age to get married -- this is the general perception.According to actor John Dumelo listed a few instances and scenarios that shouldn’t push one to marriage– Don’t marry for sex.– Don’t marry because you are of age– Don’t marry because you are getting old– Don’t marry because you are lonely– Don’t marry because you need someone to support you financially– Don’t marry because you mistakenly got pregnant– Don’t marry because you don’t want to lose the person– Don’t marry because of family pressures– Don’t marry because you like the idea of marriage and admire every wedding gown you see– Don’t marry because all your friends are getting married.In the words of Susan B. Anthony"I declare to you that woman must not depend upon the protection of man, but must be taught to protect herself, and there I take my stand."Moreover, the hormones responsible for sexual pleasure isn't the same when you were younger. The rush for kids is another aspect that can serve to be a massive disadvantage of late marriage.
It is neither good nor bad, neither too early nor too late. It all depends upon your social and economic background/status.  Say, someone is a farmer or manual labourer, it is not prudent to wait till 30 to marry. Rather he should marry before 25 so that he can have matured children before he gets broke with age.  In case of a highly qualified person who is not yet satisfied with his job/financial status and in the beginning of his career at 30, it may not be right for him to think of marrying first. He may need to work a bit more to be fit for that. If one can get spouse who is at same stage, it is not a trouble to marry around 30 and lingering on marriage is not a very good thing. Both can compliment each other very well if both have a stable and growing career.  Decision to marry now or later is one's own comfort. There is no hard and fast formula to determine that but considering our society, thinking of marrying after 35 can proved to be the worst decision for both a girl and a boy. Marrying near 30 years is not too late for educated class, these days..
Welcome to the new age...No. In fact, I do not suggest getting married for any other reason than that you love the person who you intend to  marry, and more, you are absolutely ready to be married.I understand that there are cultural norms and expectations, but, my own thought is that unless you are ready to be married, and unless you can make the time to cultivate within the bounds of marriage, the things needed to make it work, you don't have to do a thing OTHER than what makes your life phenomenal. I know that you may think that there is a time frame in which you must make this commitment, but, the truth is that no, until you are ready to make that big of a commitment, you are NEVER to old to marry, at whatever age it is that you choose to. Indeed, children and our human ability to recreate life is a very important thing to us all, but, just like marriage, that neither can be hastily done - which is the reason why I am saying now, and again, that no, you are not too old to marry, no matter what you have been told.You cannot put a time limit or a time line on something as big and important as marriage. Be happy in your life now, and when it is time, Spirit will ensure that the right partner, at the right time, will materialize for youI hope this helps!ALOHA !
