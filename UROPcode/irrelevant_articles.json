Describing the impact of delirium and risk factors in mixed populations can help in the development of preventive actions.MethodsThe occurrence of delirium was evaluated prospectively in 465 consecutive nonventilated postoperative patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) using the confusion assessment method (CAM). Patients with and without delirium were compared. A multiple logistic regression was performed to identify the main risk factors for delirium in the first 24 h of admission to the SICU and the main predictors of outcomes.ResultsDelirium was diagnosed in 43 (9.2%) individuals and was more frequent on the second and third days of admission. The presence of delirium resulted in longer lengths of SICU and hospital stays [6 days (3\u201313) vs. 2 days (1\u20133), p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 26 days (12\u201339) vs. 6 days (3\u201313), p <0.001, respectively], as well as higher hospital and SICU mortality rates [16.3% vs. 4.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.004 and 6.5% vs. 1.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.042, respectively]. The risk factors for delirium were age (odds ratio (OR), 1.04 [1.02-1.07]), Acute Physiologic Score (APS; OR, 1.11 [1.04-1.2]), emergency surgery (OR, 8.05 [3.58-18.06]), the use of benzodiazepines (OR, 2.28 [1.04-5.00]), and trauma (OR, 6.16 [4.1-6.5]).ConclusionsDelirium negatively impacts postoperative nonventilated patients.

MILNE'S account of the social life and customs of the Palaungs, a people living in a northern Shan State, but quite distinct from the Shans and belonging to the Mon Kmer group, is the outcome of her linguistic researches. When she first came into contact with them in 1906, their language had been little studied. In the course of several visits to their country, she compiled a dictionary, and in acquiring a vocabulary took her informants through every stage of the ceremony or custom for which she wished to ascertain the associated groups of words. By pursuing this method, she not unnaturally acquired a good deal of information bearing on the psychology, the social life and religion of the people. This information is the subject matter of the present book. The reading public, whether it apprehends the immense labour which has gone to the making of it or not, will at any rate appreciate the result. Mrs. Milne has produced a most readable and entertaining book which at the same time is of considerable scientific value. A welcome feature is that, as an outcome of her method, she deals very fully with the early stages of the life of the individual-a subject which frequently is very inadequately treated in the description of a primitive tribe.The Home of an Eastern Clan: a Study of the Palaungs of the Shan States.Mrs.LeslieMilneBy.

In the first place he asserted that the radio draws many persons away from reading by depriving them of part of their leisure and making them gradually lose the habit of active cerebral work. Some people, he continued, are misled by the radio into imagining that the mind can attend to two objects at the same time, which is a mistake. Far from contributing to true culture, the radio encourages a taste for superficial ideas which are easily acquired and soon lost. In answer to the objection that the radio adds to without supplanting the other modes of information and knowledge, Dr. Duhamel maintained that we cannot safely disregard or decry a system of culture which has been tested for centuries in favour of a new process of which the remote results are necessarily quite unknown.

We have shown that tumor promoter induced activation of the transcription factor AP-1 is required for induced neoplastic transformation in the Balb/C JB6 cell model. Jun and Fos family protein levels have been found not to be limiting for AP-1 response. The present study asks whether activation of Erks1 and 2 is required for AP-1 transactivation and transformation of JB6 cells and whether Erks might be targeted for cancer prevention. Expression of either of two different dominant negative kinase inactive Erk2 mutants in transformation sensitive (P+) JB6 cells substantially inhibited the tumor promoter induced activation of Erks1 and 2 and of AP-1 measured by a collagenase-luciferase reporter. Multiple mutant Erk2 expressing clonal lines were also rendered non-responsive to induced neoplastic transformation. These observations, together with our recent finding attributing AP-1 non-responsiveness to Erk deficiency in a clonal line of transformation resistant (P\u2212) cells, argue for a requirement for Erks1 and/or 2 activation in AP-1 transactivation in the mouse JB6 neoplastic progression model, and suggest the utility of Erks as a prevention target.", "title": "Expression of dominant negative Erk2 inhibits AP-1 transactivation and neoplastic transformation"}, "analytical chemistry_1949": {"abstract": "AbstractTHE separation of hydrocarbons can be effected by different methods, for example, crystallization, distillation and solvent treatment.

Bergson is to have freshened up philosophy. His point of view is nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri, and he has successfully cast off all the trammels not only of the old cut and dried philosophy of the schools, hut even the gaseous mysticism of NeoHegelianism. Yet some style him a NeoHegelian. Philosophy, he says, should be moulded on experience, and experience both changes and grows with human development. There is something of most philosophies in M. Bergson's attitude to the universe, for his philosophy is simply this: it is everything but a system. He is neither monist nor pantheist, but, as it were, a layman trying to understand. This attitude of his is optimistic; he has confidence in the universe. It may seem that he, like other exponents of \u201cthe new philosophy,\u201d has a quarrel with monism and materialism, but he himself has deprecated all philosophical quarrels, for after all philosophy is only our attitude to and conception of the Absolute, and the wise man simply absorbs the positive results of all philosophies.(1) Henri Bergson: An Account of his Life and Philosophy.By A.

The HAT domain of CBP is adjacent to the binding site for the transcriptional activator El A. Although E1A displaces P/CAF from CBP, it does not disrupt the CBP-associated HAT activity.

In the course of several visits to their country, she compiled a dictionary, and in acquiring a vocabulary took her informants through every stage of the ceremony or custom for which she wished to ascertain the associated groups of words. By pursuing this method, she not unnaturally acquired a good deal of information bearing on the psychology, the social life and religion of the people. This information is the subject matter of the present book. The reading public, whether it apprehends the immense labour which has gone to the making of it or not, will at any rate appreciate the result. Mrs. Milne has produced a most readable and entertaining book which at the same time is of considerable scientific value. A welcome feature is that, as an outcome of her method, she deals very fully with the early stages of the life of the individual-a subject which frequently is very inadequately treated in the description of a primitive tribe.The Home of an Eastern Clan: a Study of the Palaungs of the Shan States.Mrs.LeslieMilneBy.

We have shown that tumor promoter induced activation of the transcription factor AP-1 is required for induced neoplastic transformation in the Balb/C JB6 cell model. Jun and Fos family protein levels have been found not to be limiting for AP-1 response. The present study asks whether activation of Erks1 and 2 is required for AP-1 transactivation and transformation of JB6 cells and whether Erks might be targeted for cancer prevention. Expression of either of two different dominant negative kinase inactive Erk2 mutants in transformation sensitive (P+) JB6 cells substantially inhibited the tumor promoter induced activation of Erks1 and 2 and of AP-1 measured by a collagenase-luciferase reporter. Multiple mutant Erk2 expressing clonal lines were also rendered non-responsive to induced neoplastic transformation. These observations, together with our recent finding attributing AP-1 non-responsiveness to Erk deficiency in a clonal line of transformation resistant (P\u2212) cells, argue for a requirement for Erks1 and/or 2 activation in AP-1 transactivation in the mouse JB6 neoplastic progression model, and suggest the utility of Erks as a prevention target.", "title": "Expression of dominant negative Erk2 inhibits AP-1 transactivation and neoplastic transformation"}, "physical chemistry_1967": {"abstract": "AbstractINCREASING the calcium concentration in the environment of various types of isolated mammalian and insect cells hastens their progress through mitosis and also counteracts the transient mitotic inhibition following irradiation1\u20136.

No one has done more to link geology with appreciation of the natural beauty of scenery. His work as an original investigator in geology and as a writer of inspiring volumes on this subject and on physical geography won for him the Royal medal of the Royal Society in 1896.

The rnajor, minor, and minimum foldings (with their thrustings) have each given rise to a foliation and developed in chronological order. The relations of major to minor folding furnish an explanation of the fact that the major cross- foliation, unlike a slaty cleavage, fails to traverse the pelitic beds. The foliation of the plutonic intrusions, and the tremolite-schists, are products of the major movements. The principal metamorphism is in- dependent of, and older than, the major and sub- sequent movements. Its foliation is developed along innumerable thrusts, but these are at angles so acute to the bedding that, especially when thrown into rapid isoclines, they easily escape notice. This is the true explanation of \u2018monoplanic schists\u2019. The early foliation is really the regional metamorphism.

The gene-specific and widespread methylation status among the carcinomas was related to patient gender and age, and microsatellite instability status. Possible CIMP tumors were identified by comparing the methylation profile with microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAF-, KRAS-, and TP53 mutation status.ResultsThe mean number of methylated genes per sample was 0.4 in normal colon mucosa from tumor-free individuals, 1.2 in mucosa from cancerous bowels, 2.2 in adenomas, and 3.9 in carcinomas. Widespread methylation was found in both adenomas and carcinomas. The promoters of ADAMTS1, MAL, and MGMT were frequently methylated in benign samples as well as in malignant tumors, independent of microsatellite instability. In contrast, normal mucosa samples taken from bowels without tumor were rarely methylated for the same genes. Hypermethylated CRABP1, MLH1, NR3C1, RUNX3, and SCGB3A1 were shown to be identifiers of carcinomas with microsatellite instability. In agreement with the CIMP concept, MSI and mutated BRAF were associated with samples harboring hypermethylation of several target genes.ConclusionMethylated ADAMTS1, MGMT, and MAL are suitable as markers for early tumor detection.", "title": "Gene methylation profiles of normal mucosa, and benign and malignant colorectal tumors identify early onset markers"}, "environmental chemistry_1922": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON.

We prove that the strains of minimizing sequences associated to re-scaled nonlinear energies weakly converge, up to subsequences, to the strains of minimizers of a limit energy, provided an additional compatibility condition is fulfilled by the force field. The limit energy is different from the classical energy of linear elasticity; nevertheless, the compatibility condition entails the coincidence of related minima and minimizers. A strong violation of this condition provides a limit energy which is unbounded from below, while a mild violation may produce unboundedness of strains and a limit energy which has infinitely many extra minimizers which are not minimizers of standard linear elastic energy.

Moore: The formation of nitrites from nitrates in aqueous solution by the action of sunlight and the assimilation of the nitrites by green leaves in sunlight. Dilute solutions of nitrates exposed either to sunlight or to a source of light rich in light-energy of short wave-length (such as light from mercury vapour arc enclosed in silica) undergo conversion of nitrate into nitrite. There is an uptake of chemical energy in this reaction transformed from light-energy, as in the formation of organic carbon compounds in foliage leaves; it is to be added to the relatively small number of endothermic reactions induced by light. When green leaves are immersed in nitrate solution comparatively little nitrite accumulates, indicating that nitrites are rapidly absorbed by the green leaf. Nitrates taken up by plants from soil would, in presence of sunlight, be changed to nitrites, which are much more reactive than nitrates. This indicates that the early stages of synthesis of nitrogenous compounds are carried out in the green leaf and aided by sunlight. Rain-water collected for a considerable time contains no nitrites, all having been oxidised to nitrates, but if exposed to bright sunlight or ultra-violet light for a few hours a strong reaction for nitrites is always obtained.

The implements described exhibit certain characteristics of form only before seen in the rostro-carinates discovered beneath the Pliocene Red Crag and in other pre-Palasolithic deposits in East Anglia. They show also by the nature of their flaking and provenance that thev are of early Palaeolithic age. The dual character of thfese specimens is verv marked and points to the conclusion that the knowledge of the manner in which to make a palasolith was acquired by long experience in producing rostro-carinates. This view finds support in the experiments in flint-flaking which have been carried out. The specimens have been recovered from a wide area in southern England, and it seems reasonable to regard them as presenting transitional types linking the rostro-carinates with the earliest pateoliths.", "title": "Societies and Academies"}, "medicinal chemistry_1909": {"abstract": "AbstractTHE very interesting observations recorded in Mr. Walker's letter in NATURE of December 2 confirm in a remarkable manner the view I have always held, that in a very literal sense \u201cseeing is believing\u201d; that is, that a visual image is not an image on the retina, but a mental representation of what the percipient believes to be before him.

In the pages of NATURE it is appropriate to speak of the man as he appeared to his scientific friends. The dominant qualities of his mind, as they were again and again revealed in intimate personal contact, were a never-failing freshness and elasticity together with the keen insight which seized at once upon the larger problems. \u201cWell, what has been going on in science lately?\u201d was his invariable question when we met after an interval; and his deep interest was always there, whether the subject was radio-activity, or some new light upon heredity and evolution, or Arrhenius's hypothesis of life-bearing germs, persisting from the eternal past, permeating all space, and driven by the pressure of light to all the worlds. And it was just the same in the province where he was master. John Rhys was always looking for the big, far-reaching conclusions. Place-names in the Iberian peninsula were the data for inferring a former southward extension of the Basques; while their northern migration was tentatively suggested by the names of chiefs among the Picts, that mysterious pepple of which scarcely anything is certainly known. The present writer has heard him tell of the Irish chieftain of whom it is recorded in time-worn stone that he was \u201cthe sumrnorier of the fairies\u201d evidence for a fascin-ating interpretation of an ancient folk-lore. The fairies, being, an older race, living, in caves and clinging to the hills, would still be called on by their conquerors, to assist, for example, in repelling some new invader. Such were the delightful subjects of which he. talked with scientific friends, and those who would wish to trace, in brief compass, the working of his master mind, cannot do better than read and re-read his presidential address to Section H of the British Association at Bradford (1900), in which he \u201cendeavoured to substitute for the rabble of divinities and demons, of fairies and phantoms that disport themselves at large in Celtic legend, a possible succession of peoples, to each of which should be ascribed its own proper attributes.\u201d", "title": "Sir John Rhys"}, "analytical chemistry_1920": {"abstract": "AbstractIN lubrication, a fluid or other body is used to decrease the friction between opposed solid faces. The lubricant may act in one of two ways. It may separate the faces by a layer thick enough to substitute its own internal friction, modified by the mechanical conditions in which it finds itself, for that of the solid faces; or it may be present as a film, too thin to develop its properties when in mass, which reacts with the substance of the solid faces to confer upon them new physical properties. In the latter case the solid faces continue to influence each other, not directly, but through the intermediation of the film of lubricant. There are indications that these two types of lubrication\u2014 one in which the solid faces intervene only owing to their form, rate of movement, etc., and not by their chemical constitution; the other in which the chemical constitution is directly involved\u2014are discontinuous states in that one cannot be changed gradually into the other by simply thinning the layer of lubricant.

This study aims to pinpoint epigenetic markers that can discriminate between non-malignant and malignant tissue from the large bowel, i.e. markers with diagnostic potential.The methylation status of eleven genes (ADAMTS1, CDKN2A, CRABP1, HOXA9, MAL, MGMT, MLH1, NR3C1, PTEN, RUNX3, and SCGB3A1) was determined in 154 tissue samples including normal mucosa, adenomas, and carcinomas of the colorectum. The gene-specific and widespread methylation status among the carcinomas was related to patient gender and age, and microsatellite instability status. Possible CIMP tumors were identified by comparing the methylation profile with microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAF-, KRAS-, and TP53 mutation status.ResultsThe mean number of methylated genes per sample was 0.4 in normal colon mucosa from tumor-free individuals, 1.2 in mucosa from cancerous bowels, 2.2 in adenomas, and 3.9 in carcinomas. Widespread methylation was found in both adenomas and carcinomas. The promoters of ADAMTS1, MAL, and MGMT were frequently methylated in benign samples as well as in malignant tumors, independent of microsatellite instability. In contrast, normal mucosa samples taken from bowels without tumor were rarely methylated for the same genes. Hypermethylated CRABP1, MLH1, NR3C1, RUNX3, and SCGB3A1 were shown to be identifiers of carcinomas with microsatellite instability. In agreement with the CIMP concept, MSI and mutated BRAF were associated with samples harboring hypermethylation of several target genes.ConclusionMethylated ADAMTS1, MGMT, and MAL are suitable as markers for early tumor detection.", "title": "Gene methylation profiles of normal mucosa, and benign and malignant colorectal tumors identify early onset markers"}, "polymer chemistry_1991": {"abstract": "AbstractThe recombination of DNA molecules has been reconstituted in vitrousing two purified enzymes from Escherichia coli.

Assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions is one technique used by policymakers in their decisions around the allocation of scarce resources. However, even where such evidence is available, other considerations may also be taken into account, and even over-ride technical evidence. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most effective intervention to reduce HIV-related morbidity and prolong mortality. However, treatment provision in the developing world has been hindered by the high costs of services and drugs, casting doubts on its cost-effectiveness. This paper looks at Thailand's publicly-funded antiretroviral initiative which was first introduced in 1992, and explores the extent to which cost-effectiveness evidence influenced policy.Methods:This article reviews the development of the national ART programme in Thailand between 1992 and 2004. It examines the roles of cost-effectiveness information in treatment policy decisions. Qualitative approaches including document analysis and interview of key informants were employed.Results:Two significant policy shifts have been observed in government-organised ART provision. In 1996, service-based therapy for a few was replaced by a research network to support clinical assessments of antiretroviral medication in public hospitals. This decision was taken after a domestic study illustrated the unaffordable fiscal burden and inefficient use of resources in provision of ART. The numbers of treatment recipients was maintained at 2,000 per year throughout the 1990s. It was not until 2001 that a new government pledged to extend the numbers receiving the service, as part of its commitment to universal coverage. Several elements played a role in this decision: new groups of dominant actors, drug price reductions, a pro-active civil society movement, lessons from experience on treatment benefits, and global treatment advocacy. Unlike previous policy discourse, human rights, ethics and equity notions were explicitly raised to support therapy extension.Conclusion:In the early decision, moving from a relatively limited ART service to a research network was clearly influenced by cost-effectiveness data. But in the 2001 decision to include ART in the universal coverage package, cost-effectiveness arguments were over-ruled by other considerations. Thai ART policy was shaped by many factors, and was not a simple rational process which relied on evidence.", "title": "Using cost-effectiveness analyses to inform policy: the case of antiretroviral therapy in Thailand"}, "polymer chemistry_1943": {"abstract": "AbstractAPPLICATIONS are invited for the following appointments on or before the dates mentioned:", "title": "APPOINTMENTS VACANT"}, "organic chemistry_2013": {"abstract": "AbstractThe three-dimensional spatial filtering and measurement noise associated with experimental planar and three-dimensional (3D) particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements is investigated using a combination of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and experimental databases.

We have shown that tumor promoter induced activation of the transcription factor AP-1 is required for induced neoplastic transformation in the Balb/C JB6 cell model.

The present study asks whether activation of Erks1 and 2 is required for AP-1 transactivation and transformation of JB6 cells and whether Erks might be targeted for cancer prevention. Expression of either of two different dominant negative kinase inactive Erk2 mutants in transformation sensitive (P+) JB6 cells substantially inhibited the tumor promoter induced activation of Erks1 and 2 and of AP-1 measured by a collagenase-luciferase reporter. Multiple mutant Erk2 expressing clonal lines were also rendered non-responsive to induced neoplastic transformation. These observations, together with our recent finding attributing AP-1 non-responsiveness to Erk deficiency in a clonal line of transformation resistant (P\u2212) cells, argue for a requirement for Erks1 and/or 2 activation in AP-1 transactivation in the mouse JB6 neoplastic progression model, and suggest the utility of Erks as a prevention target.", "title": "Expression of dominant negative Erk2 inhibits AP-1 transactivation and neoplastic transformation"}, "biochemistry_1903": {"abstract": "AbstractI LATELY had occasion to produce some radium radiographs of two partially overlapping pennies contained in a paper envelope which was laid directly upon the photographic plate.

Spatial filtering velocity fields from a DNS of a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL) at resolutions typical of PIV experiments are shown to underestimate Reynolds stresses by as much as 50\u00a0%. Comparison of experimental PIV measurement of a turbulent channel flow and 3D tomographic PIV measurements of a TBL with higher-resolution simulations and hot-wire anemometry measurements show that in real experiments, measurement noise acts to offset this effect. This is shown to produce measurements that appear to provide a good estimate of the turbulent fluctuations in the flow, when in reality the flow is spatially under-resolved and partially contaminated by noise. Means of identifying this noise are demonstrated using the one-dimensional (1D) velocity power spectra and the 1D transfer function between the power spectra of the unfiltered velocity field and the power spectra calculated from the filtered experimental measurement. This 1D transfer function differs from the commonly used sinc transfer function of PIV owing to the integrated effect of filtering in multiple directions. Failure to incorporate this difference is shown to overestimate the maximum resolved wave number in the 3D spectra of the planar PIV by close to 10\u00a0%, while conversely underestimating the maximum resolved wave number in the 3D PIV by 50\u00a0%. Appropriate spatial filtering of the experimental data is shown to remove the noise-dominated small-scale fluctuations and bring the data inline with that which should be obtained for a noiseless PIV measurement at the corresponding spatial resolution.", "title": "On the appropriate filtering of PIV measurements of turbulent shear flows"}, "environmental chemistry_1911": {"abstract": "AbstractTHE trustees of the Beit Memorial Fellowships for Medical Research elected the following persons to fellowships on December 16.

The limit energy is different from the classical energy of linear elasticity; nevertheless, the compatibility condition entails the coincidence of related minima and minimizers. A strong violation of this condition provides a limit energy which is unbounded from below, while a mild violation may produce unboundedness of strains and a limit energy which has infinitely many extra minimizers which are not minimizers of standard linear elastic energy.

During the characterization of epitopes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum that are recognized by human T cells, we analysed a sequence of the circumsporozoite protein, and found that synthetic peptides corresponding to this sequence are recognized by T cells in association with many different MHC class II molecules, both in mouse and in man. This region of the circumsporozoite protein is invariant in different parasite isolates3,4. Peptides derived from this region should be capable of inducing T-cell responses in individuals of most HLA-DR types, and may represent good candidates for inclusion in an effective anti-malaria peptide vaccine.", "title": "A malaria T-cell epitope recognized in association with most mouse and human MHC class II molecules"}, "computational chemistry_1908": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON.

MILNE'S account of the social life and customs of the Palaungs, a people living in a northern Shan State, but quite distinct from the Shans and belonging to the Mon Kmer group, is the outcome of her linguistic researches. When she first came into contact with them in 1906, their language had been little studied. In the course of several visits to their country, she compiled a dictionary, and in acquiring a vocabulary took her informants through every stage of the ceremony or custom for which she wished to ascertain the associated groups of words. By pursuing this method, she not unnaturally acquired a good deal of information bearing on the psychology, the social life and religion of the people. This information is the subject matter of the present book. The reading public, whether it apprehends the immense labour which has gone to the making of it or not, will at any rate appreciate the result. Mrs. Milne has produced a most readable and entertaining book which at the same time is of considerable scientific value. A welcome feature is that, as an outcome of her method, she deals very fully with the early stages of the life of the individual-a subject which frequently is very inadequately treated in the description of a primitive tribe.The Home of an Eastern Clan: a Study of the Palaungs of the Shan States.Mrs.LeslieMilneBy.

This study aims to pinpoint epigenetic markers that can discriminate between non-malignant and malignant tissue from the large bowel, i.e. markers with diagnostic potential.The methylation status of eleven genes (ADAMTS1, CDKN2A, CRABP1, HOXA9, MAL, MGMT, MLH1, NR3C1, PTEN, RUNX3, and SCGB3A1) was determined in 154 tissue samples including normal mucosa, adenomas, and carcinomas of the colorectum. The gene-specific and widespread methylation status among the carcinomas was related to patient gender and age, and microsatellite instability status. Possible CIMP tumors were identified by comparing the methylation profile with microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAF-, KRAS-, and TP53 mutation status.ResultsThe mean number of methylated genes per sample was 0.4 in normal colon mucosa from tumor-free individuals, 1.2 in mucosa from cancerous bowels, 2.2 in adenomas, and 3.9 in carcinomas. Widespread methylation was found in both adenomas and carcinomas. The promoters of ADAMTS1, MAL, and MGMT were frequently methylated in benign samples as well as in malignant tumors, independent of microsatellite instability. In contrast, normal mucosa samples taken from bowels without tumor were rarely methylated for the same genes. Hypermethylated CRABP1, MLH1, NR3C1, RUNX3, and SCGB3A1 were shown to be identifiers of carcinomas with microsatellite instability. In agreement with the CIMP concept, MSI and mutated BRAF were associated with samples harboring hypermethylation of several target genes.ConclusionMethylated ADAMTS1, MGMT, and MAL are suitable as markers for early tumor detection.", "title": "Gene methylation profiles of normal mucosa, and benign and malignant colorectal tumors identify early onset markers"}, "physical chemistry_1920": {"abstract": "AbstractIN lubrication, a fluid or other body is used to decrease the friction between opposed solid faces.

It may separate the faces by a layer thick enough to substitute its own internal friction, modified by the mechanical conditions in which it finds itself, for that of the solid faces; or it may be present as a film, too thin to develop its properties when in mass, which reacts with the substance of the solid faces to confer upon them new physical properties. In the latter case the solid faces continue to influence each other, not directly, but through the intermediation of the film of lubricant. There are indications that these two types of lubrication\u2014 one in which the solid faces intervene only owing to their form, rate of movement, etc., and not by their chemical constitution; the other in which the chemical constitution is directly involved\u2014are discontinuous states in that one cannot be changed gradually into the other by simply thinning the layer of lubricant.

Sir Archibald Geikie, who figured as a \u201cScientific Worthy\u201d in NATURE thirty-one years ago (January 5, 1893), has a world-wide reputation. As a geologist, and as the author of the \u201cText-book of Geology,\u201d originally published in 1882, and of other standard works on geology and geography, he is known everywhere. This is in great measure due to the way in -which Sir Archibald is able to quicken interest in his subject by the expression of his deep and intense feeling for Nature. No one has done more to link geology with appreciation of the natural beauty of scenery. His work as an original investigator in geology and as a writer of inspiring volumes on this subject and on physical geography won for him the Royal medal of the Royal Society in 1896. From 1908 until 1913 Sir Archibald served as president of the Royal Society, while he was president of the British Association at the Edinburgh meeting in 1892. For the period 1882\u20131901, he was Director-General of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom and Director of the Museum of Practical Geology.

The results were correlated to herd data and to calving and health data for each cow from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System and the Norwegian Cattle Health Recording System. The mean concentrations were 6.9 \u03bcg vit E per ml plasma and 0.16 \u03bcg Se per g blood. Both levels were highest in mid lactation. Plasma vit E varied with the amount of silage fed to the cow, while blood Se varied with the amount of concentrates and mineral supplements, and with geographical region. No differences in vit E or Se levels were found between cows with recorded treatments for mastitis, parturient paresis or reproductive disorders in the lactation during or immediately prior to sampling, and those without such treatments. For ketosis, a small difference in blood Se was found between the groups with or without recorded treatments.

The rnajor, minor, and minimum foldings (with their thrustings) have each given rise to a foliation and developed in chronological order. The relations of major to minor folding furnish an explanation of the fact that the major cross- foliation, unlike a slaty cleavage, fails to traverse the pelitic beds. The foliation of the plutonic intrusions, and the tremolite-schists, are products of the major movements. The principal metamorphism is in- dependent of, and older than, the major and sub- sequent movements. Its foliation is developed along innumerable thrusts, but these are at angles so acute to the bedding that, especially when thrown into rapid isoclines, they easily escape notice. This is the true explanation of \u2018monoplanic schists\u2019. The early foliation is really the regional metamorphism.

Moore: The formation of nitrites from nitrates in aqueous solution by the action of sunlight and the assimilation of the nitrites by green leaves in sunlight. Dilute solutions of nitrates exposed either to sunlight or to a source of light rich in light-energy of short wave-length (such as light from mercury vapour arc enclosed in silica) undergo conversion of nitrate into nitrite. There is an uptake of chemical energy in this reaction transformed from light-energy, as in the formation of organic carbon compounds in foliage leaves; it is to be added to the relatively small number of endothermic reactions induced by light. When green leaves are immersed in nitrate solution comparatively little nitrite accumulates, indicating that nitrites are rapidly absorbed by the green leaf. Nitrates taken up by plants from soil would, in presence of sunlight, be changed to nitrites, which are much more reactive than nitrates. This indicates that the early stages of synthesis of nitrogenous compounds are carried out in the green leaf and aided by sunlight. Rain-water collected for a considerable time contains no nitrites, all having been oxidised to nitrates, but if exposed to bright sunlight or ultra-violet light for a few hours a strong reaction for nitrites is always obtained. There is no hydrogen peroxide or ozone in air at surface level. The fresh odour in open air, commonly referred to as \u201cozone,\u201d is probably nitrogen trioxide, which at high dilutions has the odour of ozone.

Sir Archibald Geikie, who figured as a \u201cScientific Worthy\u201d in NATURE thirty-one years ago (January 5, 1893), has a world-wide reputation. As a geologist, and as the author of the \u201cText-book of Geology,\u201d originally published in 1882, and of other standard works on geology and geography, he is known everywhere. This is in great measure due to the way in -which Sir Archibald is able to quicken interest in his subject by the expression of his deep and intense feeling for Nature. No one has done more to link geology with appreciation of the natural beauty of scenery. His work as an original investigator in geology and as a writer of inspiring volumes on this subject and on physical geography won for him the Royal medal of the Royal Society in 1896. From 1908 until 1913 Sir Archibald served as president of the Royal Society, while he was president of the British Association at the Edinburgh meeting in 1892. For the period 1882\u20131901, he was Director-General of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom and Director of the Museum of Practical Geology.

In the course of several visits to their country, she compiled a dictionary, and in acquiring a vocabulary took her informants through every stage of the ceremony or custom for which she wished to ascertain the associated groups of words. By pursuing this method, she not unnaturally acquired a good deal of information bearing on the psychology, the social life and religion of the people.

The reading public, whether it apprehends the immense labour which has gone to the making of it or not, will at any rate appreciate the result.

In particular, cyanobacteria are a promising biomass feedstock because of their high photosynthetic capability.ResultsIn the present study, the expression of the flv3 gene, which encodes a flavodiiron protein involved in alternative electron flow (AEF) associated with NADPH-coupled O2 photoreduction in photosystem I, was enhanced in Synechocystis sp.

The gene-specific and widespread methylation status among the carcinomas was related to patient gender and age, and microsatellite instability status. Possible CIMP tumors were identified by comparing the methylation profile with microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAF-, KRAS-, and TP53 mutation status.ResultsThe mean number of methylated genes per sample was 0.4 in normal colon mucosa from tumor-free individuals, 1.2 in mucosa from cancerous bowels, 2.2 in adenomas, and 3.9 in carcinomas. Widespread methylation was found in both adenomas and carcinomas. The promoters of ADAMTS1, MAL, and MGMT were frequently methylated in benign samples as well as in malignant tumors, independent of microsatellite instability. In contrast, normal mucosa samples taken from bowels without tumor were rarely methylated for the same genes. Hypermethylated CRABP1, MLH1, NR3C1, RUNX3, and SCGB3A1 were shown to be identifiers of carcinomas with microsatellite instability. In agreement with the CIMP concept, MSI and mutated BRAF were associated with samples harboring hypermethylation of several target genes.ConclusionMethylated ADAMTS1, MGMT, and MAL are suitable as markers for early tumor detection.", "title": "Gene methylation profiles of normal mucosa, and benign and malignant colorectal tumors identify early onset markers"}, "biochemistry_2001": {"abstract": "AbstractThe predilection muscles of Trichinella spiralis and T. nativa were studied in 2 experimental groups of 6 raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), the third group serving as a control for clinical signs.

Assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions is one technique used by policymakers in their decisions around the allocation of scarce resources. However, even where such evidence is available, other considerations may also be taken into account, and even over-ride technical evidence. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most effective intervention to reduce HIV-related morbidity and prolong mortality. However, treatment provision in the developing world has been hindered by the high costs of services and drugs, casting doubts on its cost-effectiveness. This paper looks at Thailand's publicly-funded antiretroviral initiative which was first introduced in 1992, and explores the extent to which cost-effectiveness evidence influenced policy.Methods:This article reviews the development of the national ART programme in Thailand between 1992 and 2004. It examines the roles of cost-effectiveness information in treatment policy decisions. Qualitative approaches including document analysis and interview of key informants were employed.Results:Two significant policy shifts have been observed in government-organised ART provision. In 1996, service-based therapy for a few was replaced by a research network to support clinical assessments of antiretroviral medication in public hospitals. This decision was taken after a domestic study illustrated the unaffordable fiscal burden and inefficient use of resources in provision of ART. The numbers of treatment recipients was maintained at 2,000 per year throughout the 1990s. It was not until 2001 that a new government pledged to extend the numbers receiving the service, as part of its commitment to universal coverage. Several elements played a role in this decision: new groups of dominant actors, drug price reductions, a pro-active civil society movement, lessons from experience on treatment benefits, and global treatment advocacy. Unlike previous policy discourse, human rights, ethics and equity notions were explicitly raised to support therapy extension.Conclusion:In the early decision, moving from a relatively limited ART service to a research network was clearly influenced by cost-effectiveness data. But in the 2001 decision to include ART in the universal coverage package, cost-effectiveness arguments were over-ruled by other considerations. Thai ART policy was shaped by many factors, and was not a simple rational process which relied on evidence.", "title": "Using cost-effectiveness analyses to inform policy: the case of antiretroviral therapy in Thailand"}, "organic chemistry_1968": {"abstract": "AbstractCOPPER and zinc are surprisingly widespread pollutants of water.

Moore: The formation of nitrites from nitrates in aqueous solution by the action of sunlight and the assimilation of the nitrites by green leaves in sunlight. Dilute solutions of nitrates exposed either to sunlight or to a source of light rich in light-energy of short wave-length (such as light from mercury vapour arc enclosed in silica) undergo conversion of nitrate into nitrite. There is an uptake of chemical energy in this reaction transformed from light-energy, as in the formation of organic carbon compounds in foliage leaves; it is to be added to the relatively small number of endothermic reactions induced by light. When green leaves are immersed in nitrate solution comparatively little nitrite accumulates, indicating that nitrites are rapidly absorbed by the green leaf. Nitrates taken up by plants from soil would, in presence of sunlight, be changed to nitrites, which are much more reactive than nitrates. This indicates that the early stages of synthesis of nitrogenous compounds are carried out in the green leaf and aided by sunlight. Rain-water collected for a considerable time contains no nitrites, all having been oxidised to nitrates, but if exposed to bright sunlight or ultra-violet light for a few hours a strong reaction for nitrites is always obtained. There is no hydrogen peroxide or ozone in air at surface level. The fresh odour in open air, commonly referred to as \u201cozone,\u201d is probably nitrogen trioxide, which at high dilutions has the odour of ozone.

The implements described exhibit certain characteristics of form only before seen in the rostro-carinates discovered beneath the Pliocene Red Crag and in other pre-Palasolithic deposits in East Anglia. They show also by the nature of their flaking and provenance that thev are of early Palaeolithic age. The dual character of thfese specimens is verv marked and points to the conclusion that the knowledge of the manner in which to make a palasolith was acquired by long experience in producing rostro-carinates. This view finds support in the experiments in flint-flaking which have been carried out.

However, this evidence has been obtained largely from the use of a single ionophore, the antibiotic A23187; experiments with X537A, which is another ionophorous antibiotic capable of transporting Ca2+ (ref. 3), have failed to show the expected characteristics. For example, histamine release from rat mast cells mediated by X537A is neither dependent on extracellular Ca2+ nor prevented by metabolic inhibitors4. Ionomycin is a recently described polyether antibiotic produced by Streptomyces conglobatus ATCC 31005, and is active against Grampositive bacteria5. The antibiotic action is presumably due to its ionophorous properties, as it extracts Ca2+ from an aqueous phase into an organic phase with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (ref. 6). The ionophore is also capable of transporting 45Ca2+ across biological membranes (our unpublished results). Here we report the application of ionomydn to rat mast cells. We show that ionomycin stimulates mast cell secretion solely through its ability to form a lipid-soluble calcium complex, and thus to convey Ca2+ across the hydrocarbon region of the cell membrane.", "title": "Ionomycin stimulates mast cell histamine secretion by forming a lipid-soluble calcium complex"}, "organic chemistry_1998": {"abstract": "AbstractThe mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks) are activated in response to Ras expression or exposure to tumor promoters or to growth factors, and have been implicated in AP-1 transactivation in some models. We have shown that tumor promoter induced activation of the transcription factor AP-1 is required for induced neoplastic transformation in the Balb/C JB6 cell model. Jun and Fos family protein levels have been found not to be limiting for AP-1 response. The present study asks whether activation of Erks1 and 2 is required for AP-1 transactivation and transformation of JB6 cells and whether Erks might be targeted for cancer prevention. Expression of either of two different dominant negative kinase inactive Erk2 mutants in transformation sensitive (P+) JB6 cells substantially inhibited the tumor promoter induced activation of Erks1 and 2 and of AP-1 measured by a collagenase-luciferase reporter. Multiple mutant Erk2 expressing clonal lines were also rendered non-responsive to induced neoplastic transformation. These observations, together with our recent finding attributing AP-1 non-responsiveness to Erk deficiency in a clonal line of transformation resistant (P\u2212) cells, argue for a requirement for Erks1 and/or 2 activation in AP-1 transactivation in the mouse JB6 neoplastic progression model, and suggest the utility of Erks as a prevention target.", "title": "Expression of dominant negative Erk2 inhibits AP-1 transactivation and neoplastic transformation"}, "analytical chemistry_1910": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON.

A more extended study of the subject, which has included an experimental determination of the polarisations of the doublet components, has confirmed this hypothesis. In southeast England, for ionospheric reflection at vertical incidence, the echo component of lesser delay is in general of right-handed, and the component of greater delay of left-handed, circular polarisation, but this temporal sequence should be reversed in the southern hemisphere and in certain special circumstances in the northern hemisphere.\u2014M Taylor: The Appleton-Hartree formula and dispersion curves for the propagation of electromagnetic waves through an ionised medium in the presence of an external magnetic field.

In the first place he asserted that the radio draws many persons away from reading by depriving them of part of their leisure and making them gradually lose the habit of active cerebral work. Some people, he continued, are misled by the radio into imagining that the mind can attend to two objects at the same time, which is a mistake. Far from contributing to true culture, the radio encourages a taste for superficial ideas which are easily acquired and soon lost. In answer to the objection that the radio adds to without supplanting the other modes of information and knowledge, Dr. Duhamel maintained that we cannot safely disregard or decry a system of culture which has been tested for centuries in favour of a new process of which the remote results are necessarily quite unknown. As regards the plea that the radio is a source of pleasure, Dr. Duhamel retorted that no pleasure can last several hours a day, and that for some people the radio ceases almost at once to be a pleasure and becomes a craving.", "title": "The Radio and Culture"}, "computational chemistry_1972": {"abstract": "Mechanics of Sediment Transport.By M.

Yet some style him a NeoHegelian. Philosophy, he says, should be moulded on experience, and experience both changes and grows with human development. There is something of most philosophies in M.

Moore: The formation of nitrites from nitrates in aqueous solution by the action of sunlight and the assimilation of the nitrites by green leaves in sunlight. Dilute solutions of nitrates exposed either to sunlight or to a source of light rich in light-energy of short wave-length (such as light from mercury vapour arc enclosed in silica) undergo conversion of nitrate into nitrite. There is an uptake of chemical energy in this reaction transformed from light-energy, as in the formation of organic carbon compounds in foliage leaves; it is to be added to the relatively small number of endothermic reactions induced by light. When green leaves are immersed in nitrate solution comparatively little nitrite accumulates, indicating that nitrites are rapidly absorbed by the green leaf. Nitrates taken up by plants from soil would, in presence of sunlight, be changed to nitrites, which are much more reactive than nitrates. This indicates that the early stages of synthesis of nitrogenous compounds are carried out in the green leaf and aided by sunlight. Rain-water collected for a considerable time contains no nitrites, all having been oxidised to nitrates, but if exposed to bright sunlight or ultra-violet light for a few hours a strong reaction for nitrites is always obtained. There is no hydrogen peroxide or ozone in air at surface level. The fresh odour in open air, commonly referred to as \u201cozone,\u201d is probably nitrogen trioxide, which at high dilutions has the odour of ozone.

Moir: The transition from rostro-carinate flint implements to the tongued-shaped implements of river-terrace gravels. Seven flint implements, exhibiting a beak-like profile, have been found, associated with early palteolithSj in certain ancient valley gravels. The implements described exhibit certain characteristics of form only before seen in the rostro-carinates discovered beneath the Pliocene Red Crag and in other pre-Palasolithic deposits in East Anglia. They show also by the nature of their flaking and provenance that thev are of early Palaeolithic age.

The infection dose for both parasites was 1 larva/g body weight. After 12 weeks, the animals were euthanized and 13 sampling sites were analysed by the digestion method. Larvae were found in all sampled skeleton muscles of the infected animals, but not in the specimens from the heart or intestinal musculature. Both parasite species reproduced equally well in the raccoon dog. The median density of infection in positive tissues was 353 larvae per gram (lpg) with T. spiralis and 343 lpg with T. nativa. All the infected animals had the highest larvae numbers in the carpal flexors (M. flexor carpi ulnaris). Also tongue and eye muscles had high infection levels. There were no significant differences in the predilection sites between these 2 parasite species. Trichinellosis increased the relative amount of fat, but not the body weight in the captive raccoon dogs.

Making the impact of CPOE systems more observable may facilitate their adoption by users. We set out to examine factors associated with the adoption of a CPOE system for inter-organizational and intra-organizational care.MethodsThe diffusion of innovation theory was used to understand physicians' and nurses' attitudes and thoughts about implementation and use of the CPOE system. Two online survey questionnaires were distributed to all physicians and nurses using a CPOE system in county-wide healthcare organizations. The number of complete questionnaires analyzed was 134 from 200 nurses (67.0%) and 176 from 741 physicians (23.8%). Data were analyzed using descriptive-analytical statistical methods.ResultsMore nurses (56.7%) than physicians (31.3%) stated that the CPOE system introduction had worked well in their clinical setting (P < 0.001). Similarly, more physicians (73.9%) than nurses (50.7%) reported that they found the system not adapted to their specific professional practice (P = < 0.001). Also more physicians (25.0%) than nurses (13.4%) stated that they did want to return to the previous system (P = 0.041). We found that in particular the received relative advantages of the CPOE system were estimated to be significantly (P < 0.001) higher among nurses (39.6%) than physicians (16.5%). However, physicians' agreements with the compatibility of the CPOE and with its complexity were significantly higher than the nurses (P < 0.001).ConclusionsQualifications for CPOE adoption as defined by three attributes of diffusion of innovation theory were not satisfied in the study setting. CPOE systems are introduced as a response to the present limitations in paper-based systems. In consequence, user expectations are often high on their relative advantages as well as on a low level of complexity. Building CPOE systems therefore requires designs that can provide rather important additional advantages, e.g. by preventing prescription errors and ultimately improving patient safety and safety of clinical work. The decision-making process leading to the implementation and use of CPOE systems in healthcare therefore has to be improved. As any change in health service settings usually faces resistance, we emphasize that CPOE system designers and healthcare decision-makers should continually collect users' feedback about the systems, while not forgetting that it also is necessary to inform the users about the potential benefits involved.", "title": "Organization-wide adoption of computerized provider order entry systems: a study based on diffusion of innovations theory"}, "polymer chemistry_1985": {"abstract": "The British government and British academics are both misguided on the tenure system.", "title": "Holding to tenure"}, "physical chemistry_1932": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON Physical Society, Dec. 16.\u2014Allan Ferguson and J.

This nitrogen remobilization is assumed to induce leaf senescence. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the manipulation of nitrogen availability could affect leaf senescence during seed filling. Soybean variety Fukuyutaka was grown in the side-opened vinyl house in 2014 and 2015 in Saga University, Japan. The plants were sufficiently watered with the solution containing 100\u00a0mg L\u22121 nitrogen and other nutrients before starting the treatments. The nutrient solution with different nitrogen concentrations (5\u2013800\u00a0mg L\u22121) was applied to the plants from R6 (full-seed) to R7 (physiological maturity) stages. Parallel to the progress of plant senescence after R6 stage, the leaf-SPAD value, leaf nitrogen and soluble protein contents decreased gradually in control plants (100\u00a0mg L\u22121 nitrogen); however, these parameters did not change in higher nitrogen concentration treatments, whereas decreased quickly in lower nitrogen treatments. Therefore, the leaves and stems in higher nitrogen treatments remained green even at harvest time when the whole plant senesced in control and lower nitrogen treatments. The relative expression of an autophagy gene, GmATG8c, which is associated with nitrogen remobilization, showed the lower the nitrogen availability the earlier the up-regulation. The present results revealed that the shortage of nitrogen could stimulate the leaf senescence, while increasing soil nitrogen availability could delay even stop the leaf senescence, indicating that the nitrogen availability could be a key regulating factor of monocarpic senescence in soybean.", "title": "Nitrogen manipulation affects leaf senescence during late seed filling in soybean"}, "polymer chemistry_1908": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON.

The rnajor, minor, and minimum foldings (with their thrustings) have each given rise to a foliation and developed in chronological order. The relations of major to minor folding furnish an explanation of the fact that the major cross- foliation, unlike a slaty cleavage, fails to traverse the pelitic beds. The foliation of the plutonic intrusions, and the tremolite-schists, are products of the major movements. The principal metamorphism is in- dependent of, and older than, the major and sub- sequent movements. Its foliation is developed along innumerable thrusts, but these are at angles so acute to the bedding that, especially when thrown into rapid isoclines, they easily escape notice. This is the true explanation of \u2018monoplanic schists\u2019. The early foliation is really the regional metamorphism.

Describing the impact of delirium and risk factors in mixed populations can help in the development of preventive actions.MethodsThe occurrence of delirium was evaluated prospectively in 465 consecutive nonventilated postoperative patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) using the confusion assessment method (CAM). Patients with and without delirium were compared. A multiple logistic regression was performed to identify the main risk factors for delirium in the first 24 h of admission to the SICU and the main predictors of outcomes.ResultsDelirium was diagnosed in 43 (9.2%) individuals and was more frequent on the second and third days of admission. The presence of delirium resulted in longer lengths of SICU and hospital stays [6 days (3\u201313) vs. 2 days (1\u20133), p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 26 days (12\u201339) vs. 6 days (3\u201313), p <0.001, respectively], as well as higher hospital and SICU mortality rates [16.3% vs. 4.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.004 and 6.5% vs. 1.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.042, respectively].

Yet some style him a NeoHegelian. Philosophy, he says, should be moulded on experience, and experience both changes and grows with human development. There is something of most philosophies in M. Bergson's attitude to the universe, for his philosophy is simply this: it is everything but a system. He is neither monist nor pantheist, but, as it were, a layman trying to understand. This attitude of his is optimistic; he has confidence in the universe. It may seem that he, like other exponents of \u201cthe new philosophy,\u201d has a quarrel with monism and materialism, but he himself has deprecated all philosophical quarrels, for after all philosophy is only our attitude to and conception of the Absolute, and the wise man simply absorbs the positive results of all philosophies.(1) Henri Bergson: An Account of his Life and Philosophy.By A.

Larvae were found in all sampled skeleton muscles of the infected animals, but not in the specimens from the heart or intestinal musculature. Both parasite species reproduced equally well in the raccoon dog. The median density of infection in positive tissues was 353 larvae per gram (lpg) with T. spiralis and 343 lpg with T. nativa.

This is in great measure due to the way in -which Sir Archibald is able to quicken interest in his subject by the expression of his deep and intense feeling for Nature. No one has done more to link geology with appreciation of the natural beauty of scenery. His work as an original investigator in geology and as a writer of inspiring volumes on this subject and on physical geography won for him the Royal medal of the Royal Society in 1896.

In the first place he asserted that the radio draws many persons away from reading by depriving them of part of their leisure and making them gradually lose the habit of active cerebral work.

Far from contributing to true culture, the radio encourages a taste for superficial ideas which are easily acquired and soon lost. In answer to the objection that the radio adds to without supplanting the other modes of information and knowledge, Dr. Duhamel maintained that we cannot safely disregard or decry a system of culture which has been tested for centuries in favour of a new process of which the remote results are necessarily quite unknown.

During the characterization of epitopes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum that are recognized by human T cells, we analysed a sequence of the circumsporozoite protein, and found that synthetic peptides corresponding to this sequence are recognized by T cells in association with many different MHC class II molecules, both in mouse and in man.

Data were analyzed using descriptive-analytical statistical methods.ResultsMore nurses (56.7%) than physicians (31.3%) stated that the CPOE system introduction had worked well in their clinical setting (P < 0.001). Similarly, more physicians (73.9%) than nurses (50.7%) reported that they found the system not adapted to their specific professional practice (P = < 0.001). Also more physicians (25.0%) than nurses (13.4%) stated that they did want to return to the previous system (P = 0.041). We found that in particular the received relative advantages of the CPOE system were estimated to be significantly (P < 0.001) higher among nurses (39.6%) than physicians (16.5%). However, physicians' agreements with the compatibility of the CPOE and with its complexity were significantly higher than the nurses (P < 0.001).ConclusionsQualifications for CPOE adoption as defined by three attributes of diffusion of innovation theory were not satisfied in the study setting. CPOE systems are introduced as a response to the present limitations in paper-based systems. In consequence, user expectations are often high on their relative advantages as well as on a low level of complexity. Building CPOE systems therefore requires designs that can provide rather important additional advantages, e.g. by preventing prescription errors and ultimately improving patient safety and safety of clinical work. The decision-making process leading to the implementation and use of CPOE systems in healthcare therefore has to be improved. As any change in health service settings usually faces resistance, we emphasize that CPOE system designers and healthcare decision-makers should continually collect users' feedback about the systems, while not forgetting that it also is necessary to inform the users about the potential benefits involved.", "title": "Organization-wide adoption of computerized provider order entry systems: a study based on diffusion of innovations theory"}, "environmental chemistry_1932": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON Physical Society, Dec. 16.\u2014Allan Ferguson and J.

The derivation and general properties of the Appleton-Hartree formula and the various possible modes of propagation are also discussed.

And it was just the same in the province where he was master. John Rhys was always looking for the big, far-reaching conclusions. Place-names in the Iberian peninsula were the data for inferring a former southward extension of the Basques; while their northern migration was tentatively suggested by the names of chiefs among the Picts, that mysterious pepple of which scarcely anything is certainly known.

This behaviour is attributed to the influence of the mouse chromatin near the site of transgene integration1,2. This 'position effect' has been seen in transgenic mice carrying the human \u03b2-globin gene. It was however, abolished when DNase I hypersensitive sites (normally found 65 to 44 kilobases (kb) upstream) were linked to the human \u03b2-globin transgene3\u20135. Thus, the upstream DNA (previously named a dominant control or locus activation region, now denoted a locus control region) conferred the ability to express human \u03b2-globin at high levels dependent on copy number on every mouse carrying the construct. We report here an investigation of chicken \u03b2A-globin gene expression in transgenic mice. A 4.5-kb fragment carrying the \u03b2A-globin gene and its downstream enhancer6\u20139, without any far upstream elements, is sufficient to ensure that every transgenic mouse expresses chicken globin messenger RNA at levels proportional to the transgene copy number. Thus the chicken DNA elements that allow position-independent expression can function in mice. In marked contrast to the human \u03b2 cluster, these elements are no farther than 2 kb from the gene. The location of the elements within the cluster demonstrates that position independence can be mediated by DNA that does not define a gene cluster boundary.", "title": "Site-independent expression of the chicken \u03b2A-globin gene in transgenic mice"}, "electrochemistry_1994": {"abstract": "The last of Nature's celebrations of its 125th anniversary, a conference in Japan last week, uncovered Japan's discontent with the condition of the national universities.", "title": "How to pursue academic excellence"}, "biochemistry_1919": {"abstract": "AbstractAS explained in a preface by Sir Thomas H.

Photosynthetic algae have attracted attention as a third-generation feedstock for biofuel production, because algae cultivation does not directly compete with agricultural resources, including the requirement for productive land and fresh water. In particular, cyanobacteria are a promising biomass feedstock because of their high photosynthetic capability.ResultsIn the present study, the expression of the flv3 gene, which encodes a flavodiiron protein involved in alternative electron flow (AEF) associated with NADPH-coupled O2 photoreduction in photosystem I, was enhanced in Synechocystis sp.

Assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions is one technique used by policymakers in their decisions around the allocation of scarce resources. However, even where such evidence is available, other considerations may also be taken into account, and even over-ride technical evidence. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most effective intervention to reduce HIV-related morbidity and prolong mortality. However, treatment provision in the developing world has been hindered by the high costs of services and drugs, casting doubts on its cost-effectiveness. This paper looks at Thailand's publicly-funded antiretroviral initiative which was first introduced in 1992, and explores the extent to which cost-effectiveness evidence influenced policy.Methods:This article reviews the development of the national ART programme in Thailand between 1992 and 2004. It examines the roles of cost-effectiveness information in treatment policy decisions. Qualitative approaches including document analysis and interview of key informants were employed.Results:Two significant policy shifts have been observed in government-organised ART provision. In 1996, service-based therapy for a few was replaced by a research network to support clinical assessments of antiretroviral medication in public hospitals. This decision was taken after a domestic study illustrated the unaffordable fiscal burden and inefficient use of resources in provision of ART. The numbers of treatment recipients was maintained at 2,000 per year throughout the 1990s. It was not until 2001 that a new government pledged to extend the numbers receiving the service, as part of its commitment to universal coverage. Several elements played a role in this decision: new groups of dominant actors, drug price reductions, a pro-active civil society movement, lessons from experience on treatment benefits, and global treatment advocacy. Unlike previous policy discourse, human rights, ethics and equity notions were explicitly raised to support therapy extension.Conclusion:In the early decision, moving from a relatively limited ART service to a research network was clearly influenced by cost-effectiveness data. But in the 2001 decision to include ART in the universal coverage package, cost-effectiveness arguments were over-ruled by other considerations. Thai ART policy was shaped by many factors, and was not a simple rational process which relied on evidence.", "title": "Using cost-effectiveness analyses to inform policy: the case of antiretroviral therapy in Thailand"}, "organic chemistry_1928": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON.\u2014The Rhodes Trustees have made a donation of \u00a35000 to the fund which Mr. F.

Boyd Dawkins, oelected to the Society in 1867, was eighty-five on December 26. To both of them the congratulations of all scientific workers will be heartily accorded. Sir Archibald Geikie, who figured as a \u201cScientific Worthy\u201d in NATURE thirty-one years ago (January 5, 1893), has a world-wide reputation. As a geologist, and as the author of the \u201cText-book of Geology,\u201d originally published in 1882, and of other standard works on geology and geography, he is known everywhere. This is in great measure due to the way in -which Sir Archibald is able to quicken interest in his subject by the expression of his deep and intense feeling for Nature. No one has done more to link geology with appreciation of the natural beauty of scenery. His work as an original investigator in geology and as a writer of inspiring volumes on this subject and on physical geography won for him the Royal medal of the Royal Society in 1896. From 1908 until 1913 Sir Archibald served as president of the Royal Society, while he was president of the British Association at the Edinburgh meeting in 1892. For the period 1882\u20131901, he was Director-General of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom and Director of the Museum of Practical Geology. In spite of his advanced age, Sir Archibald maintains his active interest in both science and literature, and so recently as 1918 he produced a notable volume of Memoirs of John Michell, who died in 1793, one of the early workers in geology.", "title": "Current Topics and Events"}, "physical chemistry_1925": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON.

The rnajor, minor, and minimum foldings (with their thrustings) have each given rise to a foliation and developed in chronological order. The relations of major to minor folding furnish an explanation of the fact that the major cross- foliation, unlike a slaty cleavage, fails to traverse the pelitic beds. The foliation of the plutonic intrusions, and the tremolite-schists, are products of the major movements. The principal metamorphism is in- dependent of, and older than, the major and sub- sequent movements. Its foliation is developed along innumerable thrusts, but these are at angles so acute to the bedding that, especially when thrown into rapid isoclines, they easily escape notice. This is the true explanation of \u2018monoplanic schists\u2019. The early foliation is really the regional metamorphism. But the thrusting to which it is due, unlike those of the three later series, can be referred to no visible folding.

We made the annotation process more rigorous by inspecting each gene visually, utilizing a comprehensive set of curation rules, requiring traceable evidence for each gene model, and comparing each predicted peptide to SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL sequences.ResultsAlthough the number of predicted protein-coding genes in Drosophila remains essentially unchanged, the revised annotation significantly improves gene models, resulting in structural changes to 85% of the transcripts and 45% of the predicted proteins. We annotated transposable elements and non-protein-coding RNAs as new features, and extended the annotation of untranslated (UTR) sequences and alternative transcripts to include more than 70% and 20% of genes, respectively. Finally, cDNA sequence provided evidence for dicistronic transcripts, neighboring genes with overlapping UTRs on the same DNA sequence strand, alternatively spliced genes that encode distinct, non-overlapping peptides, and numerous nested genes.ConclusionsIdentification of so many unusual gene models not only suggests that some mechanisms for gene regulation are more prevalent than previously believed, but also underscores the complex challenges of eukaryotic gene prediction.

Since the precise distribution of chromosomes at mitotic anaphase is the essential prerequisite for chromosome number stability5, this seems the most likely point at which instability could be induced in culture. It has been shown6,7 that, in culture, animal cells of various species are characterised by the presence of multipolar mitoses, a feature which would produce daughter nuclei with aneuploid chromosome numbers.

We made the annotation process more rigorous by inspecting each gene visually, utilizing a comprehensive set of curation rules, requiring traceable evidence for each gene model, and comparing each predicted peptide to SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL sequences.ResultsAlthough the number of predicted protein-coding genes in Drosophila remains essentially unchanged, the revised annotation significantly improves gene models, resulting in structural changes to 85% of the transcripts and 45% of the predicted proteins. We annotated transposable elements and non-protein-coding RNAs as new features, and extended the annotation of untranslated (UTR) sequences and alternative transcripts to include more than 70% and 20% of genes, respectively. Finally, cDNA sequence provided evidence for dicistronic transcripts, neighboring genes with overlapping UTRs on the same DNA sequence strand, alternatively spliced genes that encode distinct, non-overlapping peptides, and numerous nested genes.ConclusionsIdentification of so many unusual gene models not only suggests that some mechanisms for gene regulation are more prevalent than previously believed, but also underscores the complex challenges of eukaryotic gene prediction.

For example, histamine release from rat mast cells mediated by X537A is neither dependent on extracellular Ca2+ nor prevented by metabolic inhibitors4. Ionomycin is a recently described polyether antibiotic produced by Streptomyces conglobatus ATCC 31005, and is active against Grampositive bacteria5. The antibiotic action is presumably due to its ionophorous properties, as it extracts Ca2+ from an aqueous phase into an organic phase with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (ref. 6). The ionophore is also capable of transporting 45Ca2+ across biological membranes (our unpublished results). Here we report the application of ionomydn to rat mast cells.

During the characterization of epitopes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum that are recognized by human T cells, we analysed a sequence of the circumsporozoite protein, and found that synthetic peptides corresponding to this sequence are recognized by T cells in association with many different MHC class II molecules, both in mouse and in man.

Assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions is one technique used by policymakers in their decisions around the allocation of scarce resources. However, even where such evidence is available, other considerations may also be taken into account, and even over-ride technical evidence. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most effective intervention to reduce HIV-related morbidity and prolong mortality. However, treatment provision in the developing world has been hindered by the high costs of services and drugs, casting doubts on its cost-effectiveness. This paper looks at Thailand's publicly-funded antiretroviral initiative which was first introduced in 1992, and explores the extent to which cost-effectiveness evidence influenced policy.Methods:This article reviews the development of the national ART programme in Thailand between 1992 and 2004. It examines the roles of cost-effectiveness information in treatment policy decisions. Qualitative approaches including document analysis and interview of key informants were employed.Results:Two significant policy shifts have been observed in government-organised ART provision. In 1996, service-based therapy for a few was replaced by a research network to support clinical assessments of antiretroviral medication in public hospitals. This decision was taken after a domestic study illustrated the unaffordable fiscal burden and inefficient use of resources in provision of ART. The numbers of treatment recipients was maintained at 2,000 per year throughout the 1990s. It was not until 2001 that a new government pledged to extend the numbers receiving the service, as part of its commitment to universal coverage. Several elements played a role in this decision: new groups of dominant actors, drug price reductions, a pro-active civil society movement, lessons from experience on treatment benefits, and global treatment advocacy. Unlike previous policy discourse, human rights, ethics and equity notions were explicitly raised to support therapy extension.Conclusion:In the early decision, moving from a relatively limited ART service to a research network was clearly influenced by cost-effectiveness data. But in the 2001 decision to include ART in the universal coverage package, cost-effectiveness arguments were over-ruled by other considerations. Thai ART policy was shaped by many factors, and was not a simple rational process which relied on evidence.", "title": "Using cost-effectiveness analyses to inform policy: the case of antiretroviral therapy in Thailand"}, "physical chemistry_1915": {"abstract": "AbstractTHE wonderful romance of the life of Sir John Rhys and the great work which he did for Celtic learning have formed the theme of many a writer during the past week. In the pages of NATURE it is appropriate to speak of the man as he appeared to his scientific friends.

And it was just the same in the province where he was master. John Rhys was always looking for the big, far-reaching conclusions. Place-names in the Iberian peninsula were the data for inferring a former southward extension of the Basques; while their northern migration was tentatively suggested by the names of chiefs among the Picts, that mysterious pepple of which scarcely anything is certainly known.

Genotyping of the rs16996148 SNP was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by direct sequencing.ResultsThe levels of apolipoprotein (Apo) B were higher in Mulao than in Han (P < 0.001). The frequencies of G and T alleles were 87.2% and 12.8% in Mulao, and 89.9% and 10.1% in Han (P < 0.05); respectively. The frequencies of GG, GT and TT genotypes were 76.0%, 22.5% and 1.5% in Mulao, and 81.2%, 17.4% and 1.4% in Han (P < 0.05); respectively. There were no significant differences in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between males and females in both ethnic groups. The levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in Mulao were different between the GG and GT/TT genotypes in males but not in females (P < 0.01 for all), the subjects with GT/TT genotypes had higher serum levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB than the subjects with GG genotype. The levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB in Han were different between the GG and GT/TT genotypes in males but not in females (P < 0.05-0.001), the T allele carriers had higher serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB than the T allele noncarriers.

The limit energy is different from the classical energy of linear elasticity; nevertheless, the compatibility condition entails the coincidence of related minima and minimizers. A strong violation of this condition provides a limit energy which is unbounded from below, while a mild violation may produce unboundedness of strains and a limit energy which has infinitely many extra minimizers which are not minimizers of standard linear elastic energy.

Since the precise distribution of chromosomes at mitotic anaphase is the essential prerequisite for chromosome number stability5, this seems the most likely point at which instability could be induced in culture. It has been shown6,7 that, in culture, animal cells of various species are characterised by the presence of multipolar mitoses, a feature which would produce daughter nuclei with aneuploid chromosome numbers.

This paper was based upon the author's studies of the development of the head region of the Axolotl (Amblystoma tigrinum). The. head of the Axolotl contained three segments behind the auditory capsule. Three metaotic somites were developed in these segments, of which the first soon disappeared, and the second and third contributed to the formation of the temporal muscle. To the first segment belonged the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, to the next two the vagus. The occipital condyles were developed between the third and fourth somites. The two hypoglossal roots corresponded to the fourth and fifth metaotic segments, and passed out in front of the first and second vertebr\u00e6. In the Amniota all these segments were included in the head. The skull of an amphibian was thus shorter than that of a mammal, yet the condyles were homologous in the two animals. The shifting backwards or forwards of the condyles was brought about, not by the inter- or ex-calation of segments, but by a transposition from one segment to another. The shifting of the condyles was comparable to the transposition of the limbs on the trunk-segments.\u2014Oldfield Thomas: The mammals of the tenth edition of Linn\u00e6us: an attempt to fix the types of the genera and the exact bases and localities of the species.

Making the impact of CPOE systems more observable may facilitate their adoption by users. We set out to examine factors associated with the adoption of a CPOE system for inter-organizational and intra-organizational care.MethodsThe diffusion of innovation theory was used to understand physicians' and nurses' attitudes and thoughts about implementation and use of the CPOE system. Two online survey questionnaires were distributed to all physicians and nurses using a CPOE system in county-wide healthcare organizations. The number of complete questionnaires analyzed was 134 from 200 nurses (67.0%) and 176 from 741 physicians (23.8%). Data were analyzed using descriptive-analytical statistical methods.ResultsMore nurses (56.7%) than physicians (31.3%) stated that the CPOE system introduction had worked well in their clinical setting (P < 0.001). Similarly, more physicians (73.9%) than nurses (50.7%) reported that they found the system not adapted to their specific professional practice (P = < 0.001). Also more physicians (25.0%) than nurses (13.4%) stated that they did want to return to the previous system (P = 0.041). We found that in particular the received relative advantages of the CPOE system were estimated to be significantly (P < 0.001) higher among nurses (39.6%) than physicians (16.5%). However, physicians' agreements with the compatibility of the CPOE and with its complexity were significantly higher than the nurses (P < 0.001).ConclusionsQualifications for CPOE adoption as defined by three attributes of diffusion of innovation theory were not satisfied in the study setting. CPOE systems are introduced as a response to the present limitations in paper-based systems. In consequence, user expectations are often high on their relative advantages as well as on a low level of complexity. Building CPOE systems therefore requires designs that can provide rather important additional advantages, e.g. by preventing prescription errors and ultimately improving patient safety and safety of clinical work. The decision-making process leading to the implementation and use of CPOE systems in healthcare therefore has to be improved. As any change in health service settings usually faces resistance, we emphasize that CPOE system designers and healthcare decision-makers should continually collect users' feedback about the systems, while not forgetting that it also is necessary to inform the users about the potential benefits involved.", "title": "Organization-wide adoption of computerized provider order entry systems: a study based on diffusion of innovations theory"}, "electrochemistry_1948": {"abstract": "AbstractIN 1926, Knaffl-Lenz1 introduced a method for the bioassay of digitalis preparations by determining the minimal lethal dose on intravenous injection in an\u00e6sthetized guinea pigs.

Sir Archibald Geikie, who figured as a \u201cScientific Worthy\u201d in NATURE thirty-one years ago (January 5, 1893), has a world-wide reputation. As a geologist, and as the author of the \u201cText-book of Geology,\u201d originally published in 1882, and of other standard works on geology and geography, he is known everywhere. This is in great measure due to the way in -which Sir Archibald is able to quicken interest in his subject by the expression of his deep and intense feeling for Nature. No one has done more to link geology with appreciation of the natural beauty of scenery. His work as an original investigator in geology and as a writer of inspiring volumes on this subject and on physical geography won for him the Royal medal of the Royal Society in 1896. From 1908 until 1913 Sir Archibald served as president of the Royal Society, while he was president of the British Association at the Edinburgh meeting in 1892. For the period 1882\u20131901, he was Director-General of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom and Director of the Museum of Practical Geology.

This behaviour is attributed to the influence of the mouse chromatin near the site of transgene integration1,2. This 'position effect' has been seen in transgenic mice carrying the human \u03b2-globin gene. It was however, abolished when DNase I hypersensitive sites (normally found 65 to 44 kilobases (kb) upstream) were linked to the human \u03b2-globin transgene3\u20135. Thus, the upstream DNA (previously named a dominant control or locus activation region, now denoted a locus control region) conferred the ability to express human \u03b2-globin at high levels dependent on copy number on every mouse carrying the construct. We report here an investigation of chicken \u03b2A-globin gene expression in transgenic mice. A 4.5-kb fragment carrying the \u03b2A-globin gene and its downstream enhancer6\u20139, without any far upstream elements, is sufficient to ensure that every transgenic mouse expresses chicken globin messenger RNA at levels proportional to the transgene copy number. Thus the chicken DNA elements that allow position-independent expression can function in mice. In marked contrast to the human \u03b2 cluster, these elements are no farther than 2 kb from the gene.

We have shown that tumor promoter induced activation of the transcription factor AP-1 is required for induced neoplastic transformation in the Balb/C JB6 cell model. Jun and Fos family protein levels have been found not to be limiting for AP-1 response. The present study asks whether activation of Erks1 and 2 is required for AP-1 transactivation and transformation of JB6 cells and whether Erks might be targeted for cancer prevention. Expression of either of two different dominant negative kinase inactive Erk2 mutants in transformation sensitive (P+) JB6 cells substantially inhibited the tumor promoter induced activation of Erks1 and 2 and of AP-1 measured by a collagenase-luciferase reporter. Multiple mutant Erk2 expressing clonal lines were also rendered non-responsive to induced neoplastic transformation. These observations, together with our recent finding attributing AP-1 non-responsiveness to Erk deficiency in a clonal line of transformation resistant (P\u2212) cells, argue for a requirement for Erks1 and/or 2 activation in AP-1 transactivation in the mouse JB6 neoplastic progression model, and suggest the utility of Erks as a prevention target.", "title": "Expression of dominant negative Erk2 inhibits AP-1 transactivation and neoplastic transformation"}, "biochemistry_2008": {"abstract": "AbstractBackgroundMultiple epigenetic and genetic changes have been reported in colorectal tumors, but few of these have clinical impact.

Making the impact of CPOE systems more observable may facilitate their adoption by users. We set out to examine factors associated with the adoption of a CPOE system for inter-organizational and intra-organizational care.MethodsThe diffusion of innovation theory was used to understand physicians' and nurses' attitudes and thoughts about implementation and use of the CPOE system. Two online survey questionnaires were distributed to all physicians and nurses using a CPOE system in county-wide healthcare organizations. The number of complete questionnaires analyzed was 134 from 200 nurses (67.0%) and 176 from 741 physicians (23.8%). Data were analyzed using descriptive-analytical statistical methods.ResultsMore nurses (56.7%) than physicians (31.3%) stated that the CPOE system introduction had worked well in their clinical setting (P < 0.001). Similarly, more physicians (73.9%) than nurses (50.7%) reported that they found the system not adapted to their specific professional practice (P = < 0.001). Also more physicians (25.0%) than nurses (13.4%) stated that they did want to return to the previous system (P = 0.041). We found that in particular the received relative advantages of the CPOE system were estimated to be significantly (P < 0.001) higher among nurses (39.6%) than physicians (16.5%). However, physicians' agreements with the compatibility of the CPOE and with its complexity were significantly higher than the nurses (P < 0.001).ConclusionsQualifications for CPOE adoption as defined by three attributes of diffusion of innovation theory were not satisfied in the study setting. CPOE systems are introduced as a response to the present limitations in paper-based systems. In consequence, user expectations are often high on their relative advantages as well as on a low level of complexity. Building CPOE systems therefore requires designs that can provide rather important additional advantages, e.g. by preventing prescription errors and ultimately improving patient safety and safety of clinical work. The decision-making process leading to the implementation and use of CPOE systems in healthcare therefore has to be improved. As any change in health service settings usually faces resistance, we emphasize that CPOE system designers and healthcare decision-makers should continually collect users' feedback about the systems, while not forgetting that it also is necessary to inform the users about the potential benefits involved.", "title": "Organization-wide adoption of computerized provider order entry systems: a study based on diffusion of innovations theory"}, "organic chemistry_2004": {"abstract": "AbstractBackgroundPublic health practitioners and researchers for many years have been attempting to understand more clearly the links between social conditions and the health of populations.

From this we conclude that in CML, c-abl sequences are translocated from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22q\u2212.

It was however, abolished when DNase I hypersensitive sites (normally found 65 to 44 kilobases (kb) upstream) were linked to the human \u03b2-globin transgene3\u20135. Thus, the upstream DNA (previously named a dominant control or locus activation region, now denoted a locus control region) conferred the ability to express human \u03b2-globin at high levels dependent on copy number on every mouse carrying the construct. We report here an investigation of chicken \u03b2A-globin gene expression in transgenic mice. A 4.5-kb fragment carrying the \u03b2A-globin gene and its downstream enhancer6\u20139, without any far upstream elements, is sufficient to ensure that every transgenic mouse expresses chicken globin messenger RNA at levels proportional to the transgene copy number. Thus the chicken DNA elements that allow position-independent expression can function in mice. In marked contrast to the human \u03b2 cluster, these elements are no farther than 2 kb from the gene.

This behaviour is attributed to the influence of the mouse chromatin near the site of transgene integration1,2. This 'position effect' has been seen in transgenic mice carrying the human \u03b2-globin gene. It was however, abolished when DNase I hypersensitive sites (normally found 65 to 44 kilobases (kb) upstream) were linked to the human \u03b2-globin transgene3\u20135. Thus, the upstream DNA (previously named a dominant control or locus activation region, now denoted a locus control region) conferred the ability to express human \u03b2-globin at high levels dependent on copy number on every mouse carrying the construct. We report here an investigation of chicken \u03b2A-globin gene expression in transgenic mice. A 4.5-kb fragment carrying the \u03b2A-globin gene and its downstream enhancer6\u20139, without any far upstream elements, is sufficient to ensure that every transgenic mouse expresses chicken globin messenger RNA at levels proportional to the transgene copy number. Thus the chicken DNA elements that allow position-independent expression can function in mice. In marked contrast to the human \u03b2 cluster, these elements are no farther than 2 kb from the gene. The location of the elements within the cluster demonstrates that position independence can be mediated by DNA that does not define a gene cluster boundary.", "title": "Site-independent expression of the chicken \u03b2A-globin gene in transgenic mice"}, "medicinal chemistry_1932": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON Physical Society, Dec. 16.\u2014Allan Ferguson and J.

This attitude of his is optimistic; he has confidence in the universe.

This paper was based upon the author's studies of the development of the head region of the Axolotl (Amblystoma tigrinum). The. head of the Axolotl contained three segments behind the auditory capsule. Three metaotic somites were developed in these segments, of which the first soon disappeared, and the second and third contributed to the formation of the temporal muscle. To the first segment belonged the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, to the next two the vagus. The occipital condyles were developed between the third and fourth somites. The two hypoglossal roots corresponded to the fourth and fifth metaotic segments, and passed out in front of the first and second vertebr\u00e6. In the Amniota all these segments were included in the head. The skull of an amphibian was thus shorter than that of a mammal, yet the condyles were homologous in the two animals. The shifting backwards or forwards of the condyles was brought about, not by the inter- or ex-calation of segments, but by a transposition from one segment to another. The shifting of the condyles was comparable to the transposition of the limbs on the trunk-segments.\u2014Oldfield Thomas: The mammals of the tenth edition of Linn\u00e6us: an attempt to fix the types of the genera and the exact bases and localities of the species.

In particular, cyanobacteria are a promising biomass feedstock because of their high photosynthetic capability.ResultsIn the present study, the expression of the flv3 gene, which encodes a flavodiiron protein involved in alternative electron flow (AEF) associated with NADPH-coupled O2 photoreduction in photosystem I, was enhanced in Synechocystis sp.

Parallel to the progress of plant senescence after R6 stage, the leaf-SPAD value, leaf nitrogen and soluble protein contents decreased gradually in control plants (100\u00a0mg L\u22121 nitrogen); however, these parameters did not change in higher nitrogen concentration treatments, whereas decreased quickly in lower nitrogen treatments. Therefore, the leaves and stems in higher nitrogen treatments remained green even at harvest time when the whole plant senesced in control and lower nitrogen treatments. The relative expression of an autophagy gene, GmATG8c, which is associated with nitrogen remobilization, showed the lower the nitrogen availability the earlier the up-regulation.

The relations of major to minor folding furnish an explanation of the fact that the major cross- foliation, unlike a slaty cleavage, fails to traverse the pelitic beds. The foliation of the plutonic intrusions, and the tremolite-schists, are products of the major movements. The principal metamorphism is in- dependent of, and older than, the major and sub- sequent movements. Its foliation is developed along innumerable thrusts, but these are at angles so acute to the bedding that, especially when thrown into rapid isoclines, they easily escape notice.

The limit energy is different from the classical energy of linear elasticity; nevertheless, the compatibility condition entails the coincidence of related minima and minimizers. A strong violation of this condition provides a limit energy which is unbounded from below, while a mild violation may produce unboundedness of strains and a limit energy which has infinitely many extra minimizers which are not minimizers of standard linear elastic energy.

Sir Archibald Geikie, O.M., the Nestor of British geology, who was elected to the Royal Society so long ago as 1865, attained the age of eighty-eight on December 28, and another distinguished geologist, Sir W. Boyd Dawkins, oelected to the Society in 1867, was eighty-five on December 26. To both of them the congratulations of all scientific workers will be heartily accorded. Sir Archibald Geikie, who figured as a \u201cScientific Worthy\u201d in NATURE thirty-one years ago (January 5, 1893), has a world-wide reputation. As a geologist, and as the author of the \u201cText-book of Geology,\u201d originally published in 1882, and of other standard works on geology and geography, he is known everywhere. This is in great measure due to the way in -which Sir Archibald is able to quicken interest in his subject by the expression of his deep and intense feeling for Nature. No one has done more to link geology with appreciation of the natural beauty of scenery. His work as an original investigator in geology and as a writer of inspiring volumes on this subject and on physical geography won for him the Royal medal of the Royal Society in 1896. From 1908 until 1913 Sir Archibald served as president of the Royal Society, while he was president of the British Association at the Edinburgh meeting in 1892. For the period 1882\u20131901, he was Director-General of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom and Director of the Museum of Practical Geology. In spite of his advanced age, Sir Archibald maintains his active interest in both science and literature, and so recently as 1918 he produced a notable volume of Memoirs of John Michell, who died in 1793, one of the early workers in geology.", "title": "Current Topics and Events"}, "polymer chemistry_1907": {"abstract": "AbstractIN NATURE for September 7, 1876, there was published, with the engraved portrait by Jeans, in the series of \u201cScientific Worthies,\u201d an account of Lord Kelvin, then Sir William Thomson, and of the scientific work, extending then over more than thirty years, by which he had rendered himself illustrious in physical science. Thirty-one years have elapsed since that appreciation was written, and now we have to mourn that this life of wonderful activity has come to its natural close. At the ripe age of eighty-three, as full of honours as of years, Lord Kelvin has passed away.

Furthermore, little is known about the association of rs16996148 SNP and serum lipid levels in the Chinese population. We therefore aimed to detect the association of rs16996148 SNP and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Mulao and Han populations.MethodA total of 712 subjects of Mulao nationality and 736 participants of Han nationality were randomly selected from our stratified randomized cluster samples. Genotyping of the rs16996148 SNP was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by direct sequencing.ResultsThe levels of apolipoprotein (Apo) B were higher in Mulao than in Han (P < 0.001). The frequencies of G and T alleles were 87.2% and 12.8% in Mulao, and 89.9% and 10.1% in Han (P < 0.05); respectively. The frequencies of GG, GT and TT genotypes were 76.0%, 22.5% and 1.5% in Mulao, and 81.2%, 17.4% and 1.4% in Han (P < 0.05); respectively. There were no significant differences in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between males and females in both ethnic groups. The levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in Mulao were different between the GG and GT/TT genotypes in males but not in females (P < 0.01 for all), the subjects with GT/TT genotypes had higher serum levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB than the subjects with GG genotype. The levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB in Han were different between the GG and GT/TT genotypes in males but not in females (P < 0.05-0.001), the T allele carriers had higher serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB than the T allele noncarriers. The levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in Mulao were correlated with the genotypes in males (P < 0.05-0.01) but not in females. The levels of TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoAI and ApoB in Han were associated with the genotypes in males (P < 0.05-0.001) but not in females.

Assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions is one technique used by policymakers in their decisions around the allocation of scarce resources. However, even where such evidence is available, other considerations may also be taken into account, and even over-ride technical evidence. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most effective intervention to reduce HIV-related morbidity and prolong mortality. However, treatment provision in the developing world has been hindered by the high costs of services and drugs, casting doubts on its cost-effectiveness. This paper looks at Thailand's publicly-funded antiretroviral initiative which was first introduced in 1992, and explores the extent to which cost-effectiveness evidence influenced policy.Methods:This article reviews the development of the national ART programme in Thailand between 1992 and 2004. It examines the roles of cost-effectiveness information in treatment policy decisions. Qualitative approaches including document analysis and interview of key informants were employed.Results:Two significant policy shifts have been observed in government-organised ART provision. In 1996, service-based therapy for a few was replaced by a research network to support clinical assessments of antiretroviral medication in public hospitals. This decision was taken after a domestic study illustrated the unaffordable fiscal burden and inefficient use of resources in provision of ART. The numbers of treatment recipients was maintained at 2,000 per year throughout the 1990s. It was not until 2001 that a new government pledged to extend the numbers receiving the service, as part of its commitment to universal coverage. Several elements played a role in this decision: new groups of dominant actors, drug price reductions, a pro-active civil society movement, lessons from experience on treatment benefits, and global treatment advocacy. Unlike previous policy discourse, human rights, ethics and equity notions were explicitly raised to support therapy extension.Conclusion:In the early decision, moving from a relatively limited ART service to a research network was clearly influenced by cost-effectiveness data. But in the 2001 decision to include ART in the universal coverage package, cost-effectiveness arguments were over-ruled by other considerations. Thai ART policy was shaped by many factors, and was not a simple rational process which relied on evidence.", "title": "Using cost-effectiveness analyses to inform policy: the case of antiretroviral therapy in Thailand"}, "computational chemistry_1928": {"abstract": "AbstractLONDON.\u2014The Rhodes Trustees have made a donation of \u00a35000 to the fund which Mr. F.

This paper was based upon the author's studies of the development of the head region of the Axolotl (Amblystoma tigrinum). The. head of the Axolotl contained three segments behind the auditory capsule. Three metaotic somites were developed in these segments, of which the first soon disappeared, and the second and third contributed to the formation of the temporal muscle. To the first segment belonged the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, to the next two the vagus. The occipital condyles were developed between the third and fourth somites. The two hypoglossal roots corresponded to the fourth and fifth metaotic segments, and passed out in front of the first and second vertebr\u00e6. In the Amniota all these segments were included in the head. The skull of an amphibian was thus shorter than that of a mammal, yet the condyles were homologous in the two animals. The shifting backwards or forwards of the condyles was brought about, not by the inter- or ex-calation of segments, but by a transposition from one segment to another. The shifting of the condyles was comparable to the transposition of the limbs on the trunk-segments.\u2014Oldfield Thomas: The mammals of the tenth edition of Linn\u00e6us: an attempt to fix the types of the genera and the exact bases and localities of the species.

The type of Simia, however, would not be S. satyrus, but S. sylyana, and of Dasypus D. novemcinctus instead of D. sexcinctus, the consequences of which changes were pointed out. Pygathrix, as represented by the two species nemaeus and nigripes, was shown to be generically distinct from Presbytis, so that the latter name still remained available for the ordinary Langurs. Changes in specific names, due to a complete examination, were shown to be less numerous than might have been expected, while the stability of mammalian nomenclature was much increased by avoiding the danger of what such an examination might lead to.

Assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions is one technique used by policymakers in their decisions around the allocation of scarce resources. However, even where such evidence is available, other considerations may also be taken into account, and even over-ride technical evidence. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most effective intervention to reduce HIV-related morbidity and prolong mortality. However, treatment provision in the developing world has been hindered by the high costs of services and drugs, casting doubts on its cost-effectiveness. This paper looks at Thailand's publicly-funded antiretroviral initiative which was first introduced in 1992, and explores the extent to which cost-effectiveness evidence influenced policy.Methods:This article reviews the development of the national ART programme in Thailand between 1992 and 2004. It examines the roles of cost-effectiveness information in treatment policy decisions. Qualitative approaches including document analysis and interview of key informants were employed.Results:Two significant policy shifts have been observed in government-organised ART provision. In 1996, service-based therapy for a few was replaced by a research network to support clinical assessments of antiretroviral medication in public hospitals. This decision was taken after a domestic study illustrated the unaffordable fiscal burden and inefficient use of resources in provision of ART. The numbers of treatment recipients was maintained at 2,000 per year throughout the 1990s. It was not until 2001 that a new government pledged to extend the numbers receiving the service, as part of its commitment to universal coverage. Several elements played a role in this decision: new groups of dominant actors, drug price reductions, a pro-active civil society movement, lessons from experience on treatment benefits, and global treatment advocacy. Unlike previous policy discourse, human rights, ethics and equity notions were explicitly raised to support therapy extension.Conclusion:In the early decision, moving from a relatively limited ART service to a research network was clearly influenced by cost-effectiveness data. But in the 2001 decision to include ART in the universal coverage package, cost-effectiveness arguments were over-ruled by other considerations. Thai ART policy was shaped by many factors, and was not a simple rational process which relied on evidence.", "title": "Using cost-effectiveness analyses to inform policy: the case of antiretroviral therapy in Thailand"}, "organic chemistry_1920": {"abstract": "AbstractIN lubrication, a fluid or other body is used to decrease the friction between opposed solid faces.

The results were correlated to herd data and to calving and health data for each cow from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System and the Norwegian Cattle Health Recording System. The mean concentrations were 6.9 \u03bcg vit E per ml plasma and 0.16 \u03bcg Se per g blood. Both levels were highest in mid lactation. Plasma vit E varied with the amount of silage fed to the cow, while blood Se varied with the amount of concentrates and mineral supplements, and with geographical region. No differences in vit E or Se levels were found between cows with recorded treatments for mastitis, parturient paresis or reproductive disorders in the lactation during or immediately prior to sampling, and those without such treatments. For ketosis, a small difference in blood Se was found between the groups with or without recorded treatments.

The dominant qualities of his mind, as they were again and again revealed in intimate personal contact, were a never-failing freshness and elasticity together with the keen insight which seized at once upon the larger problems. \u201cWell, what has been going on in science lately?\u201d was his invariable question when we met after an interval; and his deep interest was always there, whether the subject was radio-activity, or some new light upon heredity and evolution, or Arrhenius's hypothesis of life-bearing germs, persisting from the eternal past, permeating all space, and driven by the pressure of light to all the worlds. And it was just the same in the province where he was master. John Rhys was always looking for the big, far-reaching conclusions. Place-names in the Iberian peninsula were the data for inferring a former southward extension of the Basques; while their northern migration was tentatively suggested by the names of chiefs among the Picts, that mysterious pepple of which scarcely anything is certainly known. The present writer has heard him tell of the Irish chieftain of whom it is recorded in time-worn stone that he was \u201cthe sumrnorier of the fairies\u201d evidence for a fascin-ating interpretation of an ancient folk-lore.

Making the impact of CPOE systems more observable may facilitate their adoption by users. We set out to examine factors associated with the adoption of a CPOE system for inter-organizational and intra-organizational care.MethodsThe diffusion of innovation theory was used to understand physicians' and nurses' attitudes and thoughts about implementation and use of the CPOE system. Two online survey questionnaires were distributed to all physicians and nurses using a CPOE system in county-wide healthcare organizations. The number of complete questionnaires analyzed was 134 from 200 nurses (67.0%) and 176 from 741 physicians (23.8%). Data were analyzed using descriptive-analytical statistical methods.ResultsMore nurses (56.7%) than physicians (31.3%) stated that the CPOE system introduction had worked well in their clinical setting (P < 0.001). Similarly, more physicians (73.9%) than nurses (50.7%) reported that they found the system not adapted to their specific professional practice (P = < 0.001). Also more physicians (25.0%) than nurses (13.4%) stated that they did want to return to the previous system (P = 0.041). We found that in particular the received relative advantages of the CPOE system were estimated to be significantly (P < 0.001) higher among nurses (39.6%) than physicians (16.5%). However, physicians' agreements with the compatibility of the CPOE and with its complexity were significantly higher than the nurses (P < 0.001).ConclusionsQualifications for CPOE adoption as defined by three attributes of diffusion of innovation theory were not satisfied in the study setting. CPOE systems are introduced as a response to the present limitations in paper-based systems. In consequence, user expectations are often high on their relative advantages as well as on a low level of complexity. Building CPOE systems therefore requires designs that can provide rather important additional advantages, e.g. by preventing prescription errors and ultimately improving patient safety and safety of clinical work. The decision-making process leading to the implementation and use of CPOE systems in healthcare therefore has to be improved. As any change in health service settings usually faces resistance, we emphasize that CPOE system designers and healthcare decision-makers should continually collect users' feedback about the systems, while not forgetting that it also is necessary to inform the users about the potential benefits involved.", "title": "Organization-wide adoption of computerized provider order entry systems: a study based on diffusion of innovations theory"}, "physical chemistry_1927": {"abstract": "AbstractALTHOUGH the undercooling of pure metals was observed by Roberts-Austen so long ago as 1898, no experiment have so far been published regarding the super of although explanations of certain structte have been based on their existence particularly regard to eutectics.

This paper was based upon the author's studies of the development of the head region of the Axolotl (Amblystoma tigrinum). The. head of the Axolotl contained three segments behind the auditory capsule. Three metaotic somites were developed in these segments, of which the first soon disappeared, and the second and third contributed to the formation of the temporal muscle. To the first segment belonged the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, to the next two the vagus. The occipital condyles were developed between the third and fourth somites. The two hypoglossal roots corresponded to the fourth and fifth metaotic segments, and passed out in front of the first and second vertebr\u00e6. In the Amniota all these segments were included in the head. The skull of an amphibian was thus shorter than that of a mammal, yet the condyles were homologous in the two animals. The shifting backwards or forwards of the condyles was brought about, not by the inter- or ex-calation of segments, but by a transposition from one segment to another. The shifting of the condyles was comparable to the transposition of the limbs on the trunk-segments.\u2014Oldfield Thomas: The mammals of the tenth edition of Linn\u00e6us: an attempt to fix the types of the genera and the exact bases and localities of the species.

A strong violation of this condition provides a limit energy which is unbounded from below, while a mild violation may produce unboundedness of strains and a limit energy which has infinitely many extra minimizers which are not minimizers of standard linear elastic energy.

We evaluated the efficacy of LDD for the subjective symptoms in primary SS patients.This was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled cross-over study. 22 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg LDD or matching placebo twice a day for 10 weeks. The first medication period was followed by 10-week washout period, after which the patient received either LDD or placebo, depending on the first drug received, followed by the second washout period. Stimulated saliva flow rates and pH were measured before and after one and ten weeks of each medication and after washout periods. VAS scale was used to assess the effect of LDD and placebo on following six subjective symptoms: xerostomia; xerophtalmia; difficulty of swallowing; myalgia; arthralgia; and fatigue. The effect was evaluated for each medication and washout period separately.ResultsOverall, the effects of medications on subjective symptoms were minor. Wilcoxon test demonstrated increased fatigue with LDD during medication (p < 0.05). The differences may, however, reflect normal fluctuation of symptoms in SS patients.ConclusionLDD may not be useful in reducing the primary SS symptoms.", "title": "Effectiveness of low-dose doxycycline (LDD) on clinical symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over study"}, "biochemistry_1923": {"abstract": "AbstractTwo octogenarian fellows of the Royal Society celebrated their birthdays this week. Sir Archibald Geikie, O.M., the Nestor of British geology, who was elected to the Royal Society so long ago as 1865, attained the age of eighty-eight on December 28, and another distinguished geologist, Sir W. Boyd Dawkins, oelected to the Society in 1867, was eighty-five on December 26. To both of them the congratulations of all scientific workers will be heartily accorded. Sir Archibald Geikie, who figured as a \u201cScientific Worthy\u201d in NATURE thirty-one years ago (January 5, 1893), has a world-wide reputation. As a geologist, and as the author of the \u201cText-book of Geology,\u201d originally published in 1882, and of other standard works on geology and geography, he is known everywhere. This is in great measure due to the way in -which Sir Archibald is able to quicken interest in his subject by the expression of his deep and intense feeling for Nature. No one has done more to link geology with appreciation of the natural beauty of scenery. His work as an original investigator in geology and as a writer of inspiring volumes on this subject and on physical geography won for him the Royal medal of the Royal Society in 1896. From 1908 until 1913 Sir Archibald served as president of the Royal Society, while he was president of the British Association at the Edinburgh meeting in 1892. For the period 1882\u20131901, he was Director-General of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom and Director of the Museum of Practical Geology. In spite of his advanced age, Sir Archibald maintains his active interest in both science and literature, and so recently as 1918 he produced a notable volume of Memoirs of John Michell, who died in 1793, one of the early workers in geology.", "title": "Current Topics and Events"}, "physical chemistry_1903": {"abstract": "AbstractI LATELY had occasion to produce some radium radiographs of two partially overlapping pennies contained in a paper envelope which was laid directly upon the photographic plate. A print from one of the results shows that the shadow of the upper coin is blurred and diminished where the rays pass through air from the edge of this coin to the plate, but that it is sharp and of the correct size where the rays pass to the plate through the lower coin. This seems to point to the production of a considerable secondary radiation by the rays in their passage through air.", "title": "Secondary Radiation produced by Radium Rays"}, "analytical chemistry_1907": {"abstract": "AbstractIN NATURE for September 7, 1876, there was published, with the engraved portrait by Jeans, in the series of \u201cScientific Worthies,\u201d an account of Lord Kelvin, then Sir William Thomson, and of the scientific work, extending then over more than thirty years, by which he had rendered himself illustrious in physical science. Thirty-one years have elapsed since that appreciation was written, and now we have to mourn that this life of wonderful activity has come to its natural close. At the ripe age of eighty-three, as full of honours as of years, Lord Kelvin has passed away. To say that his eye was not dimmed, nor his natural force abated, would be scarcely strictly true, yet he retained to the last the exercise of his intellectual powers. The vigour and keenness with which he entered into the discussions at the British Association meeting at Leicester in August last were truly remarkable at his advanced age. It was in the course of making experiments in a corridor in his country house, Netherhall, Largs, that he contracted the chill which brought about the fatal end.", "title": "Lord Kelvin"}, "medicinal chemistry_1956": {"abstract": "The Biology of SenescenceBy Dr. Alex Comfort.

These particles are effective scatterers and absorbers of visible radiation3,7 and appear to be responsible for the phenomenon of Arctic haze first reported by Mitchell8. On the basis of trace element analysis, it has been suggested that these particles originate from anthropogenic sources at mid-latitudes1,4. Direct substantiation of combustion-generated particles in the Arctic atmosphere has been provided by the identification of large concentrations of graphitic carbon particles at the GMCC\u2013NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) observatory near Barrow, Alaska, using Raman spectroscopy3. We report here on an extension of our studies of carbon particles in the Alaskan Arctic to the Canadian Arctic and the Norwegian Arctic.

It had been threatening snow most of the day, and a few flakes fell during the afternoon, the sky being overcast. At about 3.30 p.m. to 4 p.m. the sky cleared over the mountains towards the east, and revealed, instead of the usual blue, a fairly large expanse of vivid emerald green. None of us had ever seen it before, so that we all stopped.

In wilderness areas they may endanger fish in otherwise clean rivers as the result of mining operations1. In British industrial areas, they commonly contribute an average of 23 per cent of total toxicity of mixed pollution for fish, and in some rivers a much higher proportion2. Furthermore, trace concentrations, one-tenth to one-twentieth of accepted standards for drinking water, can be lethal for fish in regions where surface water is very soft1. In such circumstances, year-round prevention of \u201cspills\u201d of metal pollution can be difficult.

MILNE'S account of the social life and customs of the Palaungs, a people living in a northern Shan State, but quite distinct from the Shans and belonging to the Mon Kmer group, is the outcome of her linguistic researches. When she first came into contact with them in 1906, their language had been little studied. In the course of several visits to their country, she compiled a dictionary, and in acquiring a vocabulary took her informants through every stage of the ceremony or custom for which she wished to ascertain the associated groups of words. By pursuing this method, she not unnaturally acquired a good deal of information bearing on the psychology, the social life and religion of the people. This information is the subject matter of the present book. The reading public, whether it apprehends the immense labour which has gone to the making of it or not, will at any rate appreciate the result. Mrs. Milne has produced a most readable and entertaining book which at the same time is of considerable scientific value. A welcome feature is that, as an outcome of her method, she deals very fully with the early stages of the life of the individual-a subject which frequently is very inadequately treated in the description of a primitive tribe.The Home of an Eastern Clan: a Study of the Palaungs of the Shan States.Mrs.LeslieMilneBy.
