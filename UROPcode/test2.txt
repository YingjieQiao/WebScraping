{"Microplastics in freshwaters and drinking water: Critical review and assessment of data quality ": "Microplastics have recently been detected in drinking water as well as in drinking water sources. This presence has triggered discussions on possible implications for human health. However, there have been questions regarding the quality of these occurrence studies since there are no standard sampling, extraction and identification methods for microplastics. Accordingly, we assessed the quality of fifty studies researching microplastics in drinking water and in its major freshwater sources. This includes an assessment of microplastic occurrence data from river and lake water, groundwater, tap water and bottled drinking water. Studies of occurrence in wastewater were also reviewed. We review and propose best practices to sample, extract and detect microplastics and provide a quantitative quality assessment of studies reporting microplastic concentrations. Further, we summarize the findings related to microplastic concentrations, polymer types and particle shapes. Microplastics are frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water, and number concentrations spanned ten orders of magnitude (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122 to 108 #/m3) across individual samples and water types. However, only four out of 50 studies received positive scores for all proposed quality criteria, implying there is a significant need to improve quality assurance of microplastic sampling and analysis in water samples. The order in globally detected polymers in these studies is PE\u202f\u2248\u202fPP\u202f>\u202fPS\u202f>\u202fPVC\u202f>\u202fPET, which probably reflects the global plastic demand and a higher tendency for PVC and PET to settle as a result of their higher densities. Fragments, fibres, film, foam and pellets were the most frequently reported shapes. We conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water, to better understand potential exposure and to inform human health risk assessments.", "A review on emerging contaminants in wastewaters and the environment: Current knowledge, understudied areas and recommendations for future monitoring ": "This review identifies understudied areas of emerging contaminant (EC) research in wastewaters and the environment, and recommends direction for future monitoring. Non-regulated trace organic ECs including pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and personal care products are focused on due to ongoing policy initiatives and the expectant broadening of environmental legislation. These ECs are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, mainly derived from the discharge of municipal wastewater effluents. Their presence is of concern due to the possible ecological impact (e.g., endocrine disruption) to biota within the environment. To better understand their fate in wastewaters and in the environment, a standardised approach to sampling is needed. This ensures representative data is attained and facilitates a better understanding of spatial and temporal trends of EC occurrence. During wastewater treatment, there is a lack of suspended particulate matter analysis due to further preparation requirements and a lack of good analytical approaches. This results in the under-reporting of several ECs entering wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and the aquatic environment. Also, sludge can act as a concentrating medium for some chemicals during wastewater treatment. The majority of treated sludge is applied directly to agricultural land without analysis for ECs. As a result there is a paucity of information on the fate of ECs in soils and consequently, there has been no driver to investigate the toxicity to exposed terrestrial organisms. Therefore a more holistic approach to environmental monitoring is required, such that the fate and impact of ECs in all exposed environmental compartments are studied. The traditional analytical approach of applying targeted screening with low resolution mass spectrometry (e.g., triple quadrupoles) results in numerous chemicals such as transformation products going undetected. These can exhibit similar toxicity to the parent EC, demonstrating the necessity of using an integrated analytical approach which compliments targeted and non-targeted screening with biological assays to measure ecological impact. With respect to current toxicity testing protocols, failure to consider the enantiomeric distribution of chiral compounds found in the environment, and the possible toxicological differences between enantiomers is concerning. Such information is essential for the development of more accurate environmental risk assessment.", "Microplastics in wastewater treatment plants: Detection, occurrence and removal ": "Microplastics have aroused increasing concern as they pose threats to aquatic species as well as human beings. They do not only contribute to accumulation of plastics in the environment, but due to absorption they can also contribute to spreading of micropollutants in the environment. Studies indicated that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in releasing microplastics to the environment. Therefore, effective detection of the microplastics and understanding their occurrence and fate in WWTPs are of great importance towards microplastics control. In this review, the up-to-date status on the detection, occurrence and removal of microplastics in WWTPs are comprehensively reviewed. Specifically, the different techniques used for collecting microplastics from both wastewater and sewage sludge, and their pretreatment and characterization methods are reviewed and analyzed. The key aspects regarding microplastics occurrence in WWTPs, such as concentrations, total discharges, materials, shapes and sizes are summarized and compared. Microplastics removal in different treatment stages and their retention in sewage sludge are explored. The development of potential microplastics-targeted treatment technologies is also presented. Although previous researches in microplastics have undoubtedly improved our level of understanding, it is clear that much remains to be learned about microplastics in WWTPs, as many unanswered questions and thereby concerns still remain; some of these important future research areas are outlined. The key challenges appear to be to harmonize detection methods as well as microplastics mitigation from wastewater and sewage sludge.", "A review of bio-based materials for oil spill treatment ": "Being cost-effective, synthetic materials were initially used abundantly for the removal of oil. Gradually, however, awareness of the use of dispersants like Corexit, which makes water resources more toxic than oil, has changed the scenario for the treatment of spilled oil. The removal of spilled oil from water resources is still a very topical issue. An eco-friendly and sustainable approach towards the environment has introduced many low-cost, non-toxic and biodegradable materials along with different biomasses to make micro-to nano-sized materials, membranes, sponges/aerogel, etc. for the removal and recovery of oil from water resources. Additionally, the reusability of these materials after the recovery of oils has added one more step towards sustainability. This review comprises the work conducted by various researchers in the field of the removal and recovery of spilled oils using various biomasses and polymers, either in the form of sorbents or separators.", "Occurrence, identification and removal of microplastic particles and fibers in conventional activated sludge process and advanced MBR technology ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are acting as routes of microplastics (MPs) to the environment, hence the urgent need to examine MPs in wastewaters and different types of sludge through sampling campaigns covering extended periods of time. In this study, the efficiency of a municipal WWTP to remove MPs from wastewater was studied by collecting wastewater and sludge samples once in every two weeks during a 3-month sampling campaign. The WWTP was operated based on the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The microplastic particles and fibers from both water and sludge samples were identified by using an optical microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscope and Raman microscope. Overall, the retention capacity of microplastics in the studied WWTP was found to be 98.3%. Most of the MP fraction was removed before the activated sludge process. The efficiency of an advanced membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology was also examined. The main related finding is that MBR permeate contained 0.4\u202fMP/L in comparison with the final effluent of the CAS process (1.0\u202fMP/L). According to this study, both microplastic fibers and particles are discharged from the WWTP to the aquatic environment.", "Microplastics in freshwater systems: A review on occurrence, environmental effects, and methods for microplastics detection ": "The continuous increase in synthetic plastic production and poor management in plastic waste have led to a tremendous increase in the dumping into our aqueous environment. Consequently, microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5\u202fmm are produced and stay in both seawater and freshwater environment. The presence of microplastics as a new type of emerging contaminant has become a great issue of concerns from public and government authorities. The sources of microplastics to freshwater systems are many with the largest portion from wastewater treatment plants. The abundance of microplastics varies with the location, from above 1 million pieces per cubic meter to less than 1 piece in 100 cubic meters.\n                  Microplastics can cause several harmful physical effects on humans and living organisms through such mechanisms as entanglement and ingestion. The microplastics can act as carriers of various toxins such as additives from industrial production processes and persistent contaminants by the sorption in waters. Those toxins may cause great health problems to humans. A few studies on the fishes demonstrated that the microplastics and the associated toxins are bio-accumulated and cause such problems as intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles.\n                  In studies of microplastics, fresh water is first sampled by the nets with typical mesh size of 330\u202f\u03bcm for collection of microplastics. After the volume reducing process, the samples will then go through the purification process including density separation by such inorganic salts as sodium chloride and digestion process by oxidizing agents or enzymes. The sequence of these two processes (namely purification and digestion) is dependent on the sample type. The purified samples can be studied by several analytical methods. The commonly used methods for the qualification studies are FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and liquid chromatography. A tagging method can be used in the quantification study. Our literature study finds that there is still no universal accepted quantification and qualification tools of microplastics in fresh waters. More work is anticipated so as to obtain accurate information on microplastics in freshwater, which can then be used for the better assessment of the environmental risk.", "Identification of microplastic in effluents of waste water treatment plants using focal plane array-based micro-Fourier-transform infrared imaging ": "The global presence of microplastic (MP) in aquatic ecosystems has been shown by various studies. However, neither MP concentrations nor their sources or sinks are completely known. Waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered as significant point sources discharging MP to the environment.\n                  This study investigated MP in the effluents of 12 WWTPs in Lower Saxony, Germany. Samples were purified by a plastic-preserving enzymatic-oxidative procedure and subsequent density separation using a zinc chloride solution. For analysis, attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR) and focal plane array (FPA)-based transmission micro-FT-IR imaging were applied. This allowed the identification of polymers of all MP down to a size of 20\u00a0\u03bcm. In all effluents MP was found with quantities ranging from 0 to 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0MP\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bcm and 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101 to 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0MP\u00a0<\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bcm. By far, polyethylene was the most frequent polymer type in both size classes. Quantities of synthetic fibres ranged from 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101 to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0m\u22123 and were predominantly made of polyester. Considering the annual effluxes of tested WWTPs, total discharges of 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 to 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0MP particles and fibres per WWTP could be expected. Interestingly, one tertiary WWTP had an additionally installed post-filtration that reduced the total MP discharge by 97%. Furthermore, the sewage sludge of six WWTPs was examined and the existence of MP, predominantly polyethylene, revealed. Our findings suggest that WWTPs could be a sink but also a source of MP and thus can be considered to play an important role for environmental MP pollution.", "Evaluation of advanced oxidation processes for water and wastewater treatment \u2013 A critical review ": "This study provides an overview of established processes as well as recent progress in emerging technologies for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In addition to a discussion of major reaction mechanisms and formation of by-products, data on energy efficiency were collected in an extensive analysis of studies reported in the peer-reviewed literature enabling a critical comparison of various established and emerging AOPs based on electrical energy per order (EEO) values. Despite strong variations within reviewed EEO values, significant differences could be observed between three groups of AOPs: (1) O3 (often considered as AOP-like process), O3/H2O2, O3/UV, UV/H2O2, UV/persulfate, UV/chlorine, and electron beam represent median EEO values of <1\u202fkWh/m3, while median energy consumption by (2) photo-Fenton, plasma, and electrolytic AOPs were significantly higher (EEO values in the range of 1\u2013100 kWh/m3). (3) UV-based photocatalysis, ultrasound, and microwave-based AOPs are characterized by median values of >100\u202fkWh/m3 and were therefore considered as not (yet) energy efficient AOPs. Specific evaluation of 147 data points for the UV/H2O2 process revealed strong effects of operational conditions on reported EEO values. Besides water type and quality, a major influence was observed for process capacity (lab-vs. pilot-vs. full-scale applications) and, in case of UV-based processes, of the lamp type. However, due to the contribution of other factors, correlation of EEO values with specific water quality parameters such as UV absorbance and dissolved organic carbon were not substantial. Also, correlations between EEO and compound reactivity with OH-radicals were not significant (photolytically active compounds were not considered). Based on these findings, recommendations regarding the use of the EEO concept, including the upscaling of laboratory results, were derived.", "Solutions to microplastic pollution \u2013 Removal of microplastics from wastewater effluent with advanced wastewater treatment technologies ": "Conventional wastewater treatment with primary and secondary treatment processes efficiently remove microplastics (MPs) from the wastewater. Despite the efficient removal, final effluents can act as entrance route of MPs, given the large volumes constantly discharged into the aquatic environments. This study investigated the removal of MPs from effluent in four different municipal wastewater treatment plants utilizing different advanced final-stage treatment technologies. The study included membrane bioreactor treating primary effluent and different tertiary treatment technologies (discfilter, rapid sand filtration and dissolved air flotation) treating secondary effluent. The MBR removed 99.9% of MPs during the treatment (from 6.9 to 0.005\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121), rapid sand filter 97% (from 0.7 to 0.02\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121), dissolved air flotation 95% (from 2.0 to 0.1\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121) and discfilter 40\u201398.5% (from 0.5 \u2013 2.0 to 0.03\u20130.3\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121) of the MPs during the treatment. Our study shows that with advanced final-stage wastewater treatment technologies WWTPs can substantially reduce the MP pollution discharged from wastewater treatment plants into the aquatic environments.", "Microplastics in freshwater systems: A review of the emerging threats, identification of knowledge gaps and prioritisation of research needs ": "Plastic contamination is an increasing environmental problem in marine systems where it has spread globally to even the most remote habitats. Plastic pieces in smaller size scales, microplastics (particles <5\u00a0mm), have reached high densities (e.g., 100\u00a0000 items per m3) in waters and sediments, and are interacting with organisms and the environment in a variety of ways. Early investigations of freshwater systems suggest microplastic presence and interactions are equally as far reaching as are being observed in marine systems. Microplastics are being detected in freshwaters of Europe, North America, and Asia, and the first organismal studies are finding that freshwater fauna across a range of feeding guilds ingest microplastics.\n                  Drawing from the marine literature and these initial freshwater studies, we review the issue of microplastics in freshwater systems to summarise current understanding, identify knowledge gaps and suggest future research priorities. Evidence suggests that freshwater systems may share similarities to marine systems in the types of forces that transport microplastics (e.g. surface currents); the prevalence of microplastics (e.g. numerically abundant and ubiquitous); the approaches used for detection, identification and quantification (e.g. density separation, filtration, sieving and infrared spectroscopy); and the potential impacts (e.g. physical damage to organisms that ingest them, chemical transfer of toxicants). Differences between freshwater and marine systems include the closer proximity to point sources in freshwaters, the typically smaller sizes of freshwater systems, and spatial and temporal differences in the mixing/transport of particles by physical forces. These differences between marine and freshwater systems may lead to differences in the type of microplastics present. For example, rivers may show a predictable pattern in microplastic characteristics (size, shape, relative abundance) based on waste sources (e.g. household vs. industrial) adjacent to the river, and distance downstream from a point source.\n                  Given that the study of microplastics in freshwaters has only arisen in the last few years, we are still limited in our understanding of 1) their presence and distribution in the environment; 2) their transport pathways and factors that affect distributions; 3) methods for their accurate detection and quantification; 4) the extent and relevance of their impacts on aquatic life. We also do not know how microplastics might transfer from freshwater to terrestrial ecosystems, and we do not know if and how they may affect human health. This is concerning because human populations have a high dependency on freshwaters for drinking water and for food resources. Increasing the level of understanding in these areas is essential if we are to develop appropriate policy and management tools to address this emerging issue.", "Continuous ozonation of urban wastewater: Removal of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and antibiotic resistance genes and phytotoxicity ": "This work evaluated the removal of a mixture of eight antibiotics (i.e. ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLA), ofloxacin (OFL), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and tetracycline (TC)) from urban wastewater, by ozonation operated in continuous mode at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (i.e. 10, 20, 40 and 60\u202fmin) and specific ozone doses (i.e. 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 gO3 gDOC\u2212 1). As expected, the efficiency of ozonation was highly ozone dose- and contact time-dependent. The removal of the parent compounds of the selected antibiotics to levels below their detection limits was achieved with HRT of 40\u202fmin and specific ozone dose of 0.125 gO3 gDOC\u2212 1. The effect of ozonation was also investigated at a microbiological and genomic level, by studying the efficiency of the process with respect to the inactivation of Escherichia coli and antibiotic-resistant E.\u00a0coli, as well as to the reduction of the abundance of selected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The inactivation of total cultivable E.\u00a0coli was achieved under the experimental conditions of HRT 40\u202fmin and 0.25 gO3 gDOC\u22121, at which all antibiotic compounds were already degraded. The regrowth examinations revealed that higher ozone concentrations were required for the permanent inactivation of E.\u00a0coli below the Limit of Quantification (<LOQ\u202f=\u202f0.01\u202fCFU mL\u2212 1). Also, the abundance of the examined ARGs (intl1, aadA1, dfrA1, qacE\u03941 and sul1) was found to decrease with increasing HRT and ozone dose. Despite the fact that the mildest operating parameters were able to eliminate the parent compounds of the tested antibiotics in wastewater effluents, it was clearly demonstrated in this study that higher ozone doses were required in order to confer permanent damage and/or death and prevent potential post-treatment re-growth of both total bacteria and ARB, and to reduce the abundance of ARGs below the LOQ. Interestingly, the mineralization of wastewater, in terms of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) removal, was found to be significantly low even when the higher ozone doses were applied, leading to an increased phytotoxicity towards various plant species. The findings of this study clearly underline the importance of properly optimising the ozonation process (e.g. specific ozone dose and contact time) taking into consideration both the bacterial species and associated ARGs, as well as the wastewater physicochemical properties (e.g. DOC), in order to mitigate the spread of ARB&ARGs, as well as to reduce the potential phytotoxicity.", "Antibiotic resistance genes in treated wastewater and in the receiving water bodies: A pan-European survey of urban settings ": "There is increasing public concern regarding the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during wastewater treatment, their persistence during the treatment process and their potential impacts on the receiving water bodies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine the abundance of nine ARGs and a class 1 integron associated integrase gene in 16 wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents from ten different European countries. In order to assess the impact on the receiving water bodies, gene abundances in the latter were also analysed.\n                  Six out of the nine ARGs analysed were detected in all effluent and river water samples. Among the quantified genes, intI1 and sul1 were the most abundant. Our results demonstrate that European WWTP contribute to the enrichment of the resistome in the receiving water bodies with the particular impact being dependent on the effluent load and local hydrological conditions. The ARGs concentrations in WWTP effluents were found to be inversely correlated to the number of implemented biological treatment steps, indicating a possible option for WWTP management.\n                  Furthermore, this study has identified bla\n                     OXA-58 as a possible resistance gene for future studies investigating the impact of WWTPs on their receiving water.", "Nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment processes \u2013 Origin, impact and potential solutions ": "The presence of nano and microplastics in water has increasingly become a major environmental challenge. A key challenge in their detection resides in the relatively inadequate analytical techniques available preventing deep understanding of the fate of nano/microplastics in water. The occurrence of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment plants poses a concern for the quality of the treated water. Due to their broad but small size and diverse chemical natures, nano/microplastics may travel easily along water and wastewater treatment processes infiltrating remediation processes at various levels, representing operational and process stability challenges. This review aims at presenting the current understanding of the fate and impact of nano/microplastics through water and wastewater treatment plants. The formation and fragmentation mechanisms, physical-chemical properties and occurrence of nano/microplastics in water are correlated to the interactions of nano/microplastics with water and wastewater treatment plant processes and potential solutions to limit these interactions are comprehensively reviewed. This critical analysis offers new strategies to limit the number of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater to keep water quality up to the required standards and reduce threats on our ecosystems.", "Determinants of presence and removal of antibiotic resistance genes during WWTP treatment: A cross-sectional study ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), linking human fecal residues and the environment, are considered as hotspots for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In order to evaluate the role of WWTPs and underlying operational parameters for the removal of AMR, the presence and removal efficiency of a selected set of 6 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and 2 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) was evaluated by means of qPCR in influent and effluent samples from 62 Dutch WWTPs. The role of possible factors impacting the concentrations of ARGs and MGEs in the influent and their removal was identified through statistical analysis. ARGs and the class I integron-integrase gene (intI1) were, on average, removed to a similar extent (1.76 log reduction) or better (+0.30\u20131.90 logs) than the total bacteria (measured as 16S rRNA gene). In contrast, broad-host-range plasmids (IncP-1) had a significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) relative abundance after treatment. The presence of healthcare institutions in the area served did only slightly increase the concentrations of ARGs or MGEs in influent. From the extended panel of operational parameters, rainfall, increasing the hydraulic load of the plant, most significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) affected the treatment efficiency by decreasing it on average\u00a0\u22120.38 logs per time the flow exceeded the average daily flow. Our results suggest that overall, WWTP treatments do not favor the proliferation of the assessed resistance genes but might increase the relative abundance of broad-host-range plasmids of the IncP-1 type.", "Full-scale partial nitritation/anammox experiences \u2013 An application survey ": "Partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) has been one of the most innovative developments in biological wastewater treatment in recent years. With its discovery in the 1990s a completely new way of ammonium removal from wastewater became available. Over the past decade many technologies have been developed and studied for their applicability to the PN/A concept and several have made it into full-scale. With the perspective of reaching 100 full-scale installations in operation worldwide by 2014 this work presents a summary of PN/A technologies that have been successfully developed, implemented and optimized for high-strength ammonium wastewaters with low C:N ratios and elevated temperatures. The data revealed that more than 50% of all PN/A installations are sequencing batch reactors, 88% of all plants being operated as single-stage systems, and 75% for sidestream treatment of municipal wastewater. Additionally an in-depth survey of 14 full-scale installations was conducted to evaluate practical experiences and report on operational control and troubleshooting. Incoming solids, aeration control and nitrate built up were revealed as the main operational difficulties. The information provided gives a unique/new perspective throughout all the major technologies and discusses the remaining obstacles.", "Spatial ecology of a wastewater network defines the antibiotic resistance genes in downstream receiving waters ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an effective barrier in the protection of human and environment health around the world, although WWTPs also are suggested to be selectors and-or reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) before entering the environment. The dogma about WWTPs as \u201cARG selectors\u201d presumes that biotreatment compartments (e.g., activated sludge; AS) are single densely populated ecosystems with elevated horizontal gene transfer. However, recent work has suggested WWTP biotreatment compartments may be different than previously believed relative to antibiotic resistance (AR) fate, and other process factors, such as bacterial separation and specific waste sources, may be key to ARGs released to the environment. Here we combined 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing and high-throughput qPCR to characterise microbial communities and ARGs across a wastewater network in Spain that includes both community (i.e., non-clinical urban) and hospital sources. Contrary to expectations, ARGs found in downstream receiving waters were not dominated by AS biosolids (RAS), but more resembled raw wastewater sources. In fact, ARGs and microbial communities in liquid-phase WWTP effluents and RAS were significantly different (Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index\u202f=\u202f0.66\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.11), with a consequential fraction of influent ARGs and organisms passing directly through the WWTP with limited association with RAS. Instead, ARGs and organisms in the RAS may be more defined by biosolids separation and biophysical traits, such as flocculation, rather than ARG carriage. This explains why RAS has significantly lower ARG richness (47\u202f\u00b1\u202f4 ARGs) than liquid-phase effluents (104\u202f\u00b1\u202f5 ARGs), and downstream water column (135\u202f\u00b1\u202f4 ARGs) and river sediments (120\u202f\u00b1\u202f5 ARGs) (Tukey's test, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). These data suggest RAS and liquid-phase WWTP effluents may reflect two parallel ecosystems with potentially limited ARG exchange. As such, ARG mitigation in WWTPs should more focus on removing bacterial hosts from the liquid phase, AR source reduction, and possibly disinfection to reduce ARG releases to the environment.", "Lead release to potable water during the Flint, Michigan water crisis as revealed by routine biosolids monitoring data ": "Routine biosolids monitoring data provides an independent and comprehensive means to estimate water lead release pre-, during and post-Flint Water Crisis (FWC). The mass of potable plumbing-related metals (i.e., lead, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc) in sewage biosolids strongly correlated with one another during the FWC (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). A simple parametric regression model based on 90th percentile potable water lead measurements (WLL90) from five city-wide citizen science sampling efforts August 2015\u2013August 2017 was strongly correlated to corresponding monthly lead mass in biosolids [Biosolids-Pb (kg)\u00a0=\u00a00.483 x WLL90 (\u03bcg/L)\u00a0+\u00a01.79; R2\u202f=\u202f0.86, p\u202f<\u202f0.05]. Although total biosolids lead increased just 14% during the 18 months of the FWC versus the comparable time pre-FWC, 76% of that increase occurred in July\u2013September 2014, and the corresponding percentage of Flint children under 6 years with elevated blood lead \u2265 5\u202f\u03bcg/dL (i.e., %EBL5) doubling from 3.45% to 6.61% in those same three months versus 2013 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). %EBL5 was not statistically higher during the remaining months of the FWC compared to pre-FWC or post-FWC. As expected, lead in biosolids during the FWC, when orthophosphate was not added, was moderately correlated with water temperature (R2\u202f=\u202f0.30, p\u202f<\u202f0.05), but not at other times pre- and post-FWC when orthophosphate was present. Tripling the orthophosphate dose post-FWC versus pre-FWC and some lead pipe removal, decreased lead in biosolids (and %EBL5) to historic lows (2016\u20132017 vs. 2012\u20132013; p\u202f<\u202f0.05), supporting the effectiveness of these public health interventions in reducing childhood water lead exposure.", "Diversity and antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli populations in hospital and community wastewater compared to wastewater at the receiving urban treatment plant ": "Bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns among the indicator organism Escherichia coli were monitored in wastewater samples collected over one year from a hospital (HW), a community (CW) and the receiving urban (UW) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We compared levels of antibiotic resistance in the different types of wastewater, and identified whether resistant strains were endemic in the wastewater system. If so, implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots (e.g. hospital outlets) could be used to decrease the amount of resistant bacteria in the wastewater. E.\u00a0coli from HW (n\u202f=\u202f2644), CW (n\u202f=\u202f2525) and UW (n\u202f=\u202f2693) were analyzed by biochemical phenotyping (PhenePlate System) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics (AREB System). The phenotypic diversities of the total E.\u00a0coli populations were similar for all three sites (Simpson's Diversity index, Di\u202f=\u202f0.973), however for individual samples, HW showed low diversities (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.800) and the E.\u00a0coli flora was often dominated by strains that may have originated from the fecal flora of single individuals. The diversities in CW samples was higher (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.936), and UW samples showed similar diversities as the whole collection of isolates (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.971). Resistance to at least one of the nine antibiotics was observed in 45% of the HW isolates, 44% of CW isolates, and 33% of UW isolates. Resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol was uncommon (3.2 and 5.3%, respectively), whereas resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was most common (24% and 31%, respectively). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E.\u00a0coli (ESBL-EC) were more common in HW (11.5%) and in CW (6.9%) compared to UW (3.7%). A high diversity (Di\u202f=\u202f0.974) was observed among ESBL-EC isolates from UW (n\u202f=\u202f99), indicating absence of any clonal structure among these isolates. Common PhP types of ESBL-EC often dominated in each HW sample, but were not identified across different samples, whereas ESBL-EC in CW showed low diversity (Di\u202f=\u202f0.857) and were dominated by a specific PhP type that was found across almost all CW samples. The antibiotic resistance rates were highest in hospital wastewater, but surprisingly they were also high in the studied community wastewater, compared to the urban wastewater. The relative contribution of HW seemed low in terms of dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria to the WWTP.", "Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill: A source of microplastics? -Evidence of microplastics in landfill leachate ": "Although landfill is suspected to be releasing microplastics to the environment, there is few empirical researches carried out. To clarify suspicions of landfills as potential sources of microplastics, twelve leachate samples from four active and two closed municipal solid waste landfills were investigated. Microplastics were found in all the landfill leachate samples. In total, seventeen different types of plastics were identified in the leachate samples with calculated concentration ranging from 0.42 to 24.58 items/L. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the predominant polymer types. 99.36% microplastics were derived from the fragmentation of plastic waste buried in landfills. The size of 77.48% microplastics was between 100 and 1000\u202f\u03bcm. The study shows that the generation, accumulation and release of microplastic in landfills is a long-term process. The results of our study provide preliminary evidence and validate that landfill isn't the final sink of plastics, but a potential source of microplastics.", "Analysis of microplastics in water by micro-Raman spectroscopy: Release of plastic particles from different packaging into mineral water ": "Microplastics are anthropogenic contaminants which have been found in oceans, lakes and rivers. Investigations focusing on drinking water are rare and studies have mainly been using micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (\u03bc-FT-IR). A major limitation of this technique is its inability to detect particles smaller than 20\u00a0\u03bcm. However, micro-Raman spectroscopy is capable of detecting even smaller particle sizes. Therefore, we show that this technique, which was used in this study, is particularly useful in detecting microplastics in drinking water where particle sizes are in the low micrometer range. In our study, we compared the results from drinking water distributed in plastic bottles, glass bottles and beverage cartons.\n                  We tested the microplastic content of water from 22 different returnable and single-use plastic bottles, 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles obtained from grocery stores in Germany. Small (\u201350-500\u00a0\u03bcm) and very small (1\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm) microplastic fragments were found in every type of water. Interestingly, almost 80% of all microplastic particles found had a particle size between 5 and 20\u00a0\u03bcm and were therefore not detectable by the analytical techniques used in previous studies. The average microplastics content was 118\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088 particles/l in returnable, but only 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 particles/l in single-use plastic bottles. The microplastics content in the beverage cartons was only 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 particles/l. Contrary to our assumptions we found high amounts of plastic particles in some of the glass bottled waters (range 0\u2013253 particles/l, mean 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a052 particles/l). A statistically significant difference from the blank value (14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013) to the investigated packaging types could only be shown comparing to the returnable bottles (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\n                  Most of the particles in water from returnable plastic bottles were identified as consisting of polyester (primary polyethylene terephthalate PET, 84%) and polypropylene (PP; 7%). This is not surprising since the bottles are made of PET and the caps are made of PP. In water from single-use plastic bottles only a few micro-PET-particles have been found. In the water from beverage cartons and also from glass bottles, microplastic particles other than PET were found, for example polyethylene or polyolefins. This can be explained by the fact that beverage cartons are coated with polyethylene foils and caps are treated with lubricants. Therefore, these findings indicate that the packaging itself may release microparticles. The main fraction of the microplastic particles identified are of very small size with dimensions less than 20\u00a0\u03bcm, which is not detectable with the \u03bc-FT-IR technique used in previous studies.", "Transport and fate of microplastic particles in wastewater treatment plants ": "Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are frequently suspected as significant point sources or conduits of microplastics to the environment. To directly investigate these suspicions, effluent discharges from seven tertiary plants and one secondary plant in Southern California were studied. The study also looked at influent loads, particle size/type, conveyance, and removal at these wastewater treatment facilities. Over 0.189 million liters of effluent at each of the seven tertiary plants were filtered using an assembled stack of sieves with mesh sizes between 400 and 45\u00a0\u03bcm. Additionally, the surface of 28.4 million liters of final effluent at three tertiary plants was skimmed using a 125\u00a0\u03bcm filtering assembly. The results suggest that tertiary effluent is not a significant source of microplastics and that these plastic pollutants are effectively removed during the skimming and settling treatment processes. However, at a downstream secondary plant, an average of one micro-particle in every 1.14 thousand liters of final effluent was counted. The majority of microplastics identified in this study had a profile (color, shape, and size) similar to the blue polyethylene particles present in toothpaste formulations. Existing treatment processes were determined to be very effective for removal of microplastic contaminants entering typical municipal WWTPs.", "Applications of nanotechnology in water and wastewater treatment ": "Providing clean and affordable water to meet human needs is a grand challenge of the 21st century. Worldwide, water supply struggles to keep up with the fast growing demand, which is exacerbated by population growth, global climate change, and water quality deterioration. The need for technological innovation to enable integrated water management cannot be overstated. Nanotechnology holds great potential in advancing water and wastewater treatment to improve treatment efficiency as well as to augment water supply through safe use of unconventional water sources. Here we review recent development in nanotechnology for water and wastewater treatment. The discussion covers candidate nanomaterials, properties and mechanisms that enable the applications, advantages and limitations as compared to existing processes, and barriers and research needs for commercialization. By tracing these technological advances to the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials, the present review outlines the opportunities and limitations to further capitalize on these unique properties for sustainable water management.", "Full-scale comparison of UV/H2O2 and UV/Cl2 advanced oxidation: The degradation of micropollutant surrogates and the formation of disinfection byproducts ": "The photolysis of chlorine by UV light leads to the formation of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) as well as reactive chlorine species (RCS) that can be effective as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water treatment. Much of the research to date has been done at laboratory- or bench-scale. This study reports results from a model that demonstrates that the relative effectiveness of the UV/Cl2 AOP compared to the more traditional UV/H2O2 AOP is a function of optical path length. As such, the relative effectiveness of the two treatment options evaluated at small scale may not reflect the relative performance at full-scale, making results previously obtained at small-scale potentially less scalable. This study therefore compares the performance of UV/Cl2 to UV/H2O2 at a full-scale water treatment plant, using sucralose and caffeine as spiked surrogates for contaminants that are reactive solely to OH radicals, and to both OH and RCS, respectively. pH was varied between 6.5 and 8.0. The results demonstrated that when using a medium pressure UV lamp, UV/Cl2 might lead to approximately twice the production of OH radicals as UV/H2O2 at pH 6.5 when using the same molar oxidant concentration, but adding chlorine to the UV reactor at pH 8.0 had a negligible impact on OH radical concentration in comparison to UV alone. The study also confirmed previous small-scale results that RCS can be a major contributor to UV/Cl2 treatment for compounds such as caffeine that are susceptible to RCS, with UV/Cl2 effective at both pH 6.5 and 8.0 for such compounds. Disinfection byproducts were monitored, with adsorbable organohalide (AOX) formation increasing by approximately 10\u202f\u03bcg-Cl/L due to chlorine photolysis, but only at pH 6.5 and not at pH 8.0. This implies that UV/Cl2 might increase AOX mostly due to reaction between OH and organic precursors to make them more reactive with chlorine, and not due to RCS. The formation of specific DBPs of current or emerging regulatory interest was minimal under all conditions, except for chlorate. Chlorate yields were in the order of 6\u201318% of the photolysed chlorine.", "Export of microplastics from land to sea. A modelling approach ": "Quantifying the transport of plastic debris from river to sea is crucial for assessing the risks of plastic debris to human health and the environment. We present a global modelling approach to analyse the composition and quantity of point-source microplastic fluxes from European rivers to the sea. The model accounts for different types and sources of microplastics entering river systems via point sources. We combine information on these sources with information on sewage management and plastic retention during river transport for the largest European rivers. Sources of microplastics include personal care products, laundry, household dust and tyre and road wear particles (TRWP). Most of the modelled microplastics exported by rivers to seas are synthetic polymers from TRWP (42%) and plastic-based textiles abraded during laundry (29%). Smaller sources are synthetic polymers and plastic fibres in household dust (19%) and microbeads in personal care products (10%). Microplastic export differs largely among European rivers, as a result of differences in socio-economic development and technological status of sewage treatment facilities. About two-thirds of the microplastics modelled in this study flow into the Mediterranean and Black Sea. This can be explained by the relatively low microplastic removal efficiency of sewage treatment plants in the river basins draining into these two seas. Sewage treatment is generally more efficient in river basins draining into the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. We use our model to explore future trends up to the year 2050. Our scenarios indicate that in the future river export of microplastics may increase in some river basins, but decrease in others. Remarkably, for many basins we calculate a reduction in river export of microplastics from point-sources, mainly due to an anticipated improvement in sewage treatment.", "Persistent contaminants as potential constraints on the recovery of urban river food webs from gross pollution ": "Urban areas contribute substantially to xenobiotic contaminant loads in rivers, but their effects have been investigated more for individual organisms and sensitive taxa, rather than through the emergent properties of communities. Here, we use replicated, catchment-scale sampling of benthic invertebrates and novel multivariate techniques to assess whether urban wastewater contaminants affected the structure and function of river food webs. We postulated that the continued occurrence of selected contaminants in river systems might explain the incomplete recovery of urban rivers from legacy gross pollution. Benthic invertebrate communities were sampled monthly over a year (2016\u20132017) at 18 sites across 3 river systems in South Wales (United Kingdom). Contaminant sources were characterised using remote sensing, water quality data from routine monitoring and measured concentrations of selected persistent xenobiotic pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers). Urban wastewater discharges had relatively limited effects on river water quality, with small increases in nitrate, phosphate, temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solids in urban systems. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in invertebrates, however, were significantly higher under greater urban land cover and wastewater discharge. Food webs at the most highly contaminated urban sites were characterised by: (i) reduced taxonomic and functional diversity; (ii) simplified food web structure with reduced network connectance; and (iii) reductions in the abundance of prey important for apex predators such as the Eurasian dipper (Cinclus cinclus). Although correlative and partially confounded by other effects, these data provide support for the hypothesis that impairment to food webs resulting from urban pollutants might explain population, community and ecosystem-level effects in urban river systems, and hence incomplete recovery from past pollution.", "Current time-temperature relationships for thermal inactivation of Ascaris eggs at mesophilic temperatures are too conservative and may hamper development of simple, but effective sanitation ": "Ascaris eggs are commonly used as indicators for pathogen inactivation during the treatment of fecal sludge and wastewater due to their highly resistant lipid membrane and ability to survive in the environment for long periods of time. Current guidelines suggest that thermal treatment alone cannot inactivate Ascaris eggs at temperatures below 45\u202f\u00b0C, although some evidence in the literature suggests this to be incorrect. Here, we performed a controlled experiment to test the effect of mesophilic temperatures on Ascaris inactivation. We exposed Ascaris suum eggs to a temperature gradient between 34\u00b0C and 45\u202f\u00b0C under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to observe the required exposure times for a 3-log reduction. Indeed, we found that temperatures lower than 45\u202f\u00b0C did inactivate these eggs, and the required exposure times were up to two orders of magnitude shorter than suggested by current guidelines. Results from the anaerobic exposures were used to develop a time-temperature relationship that is appropriate for Ascaris inactivation at mesophilic temperatures. Data from the literature demonstrated that our relationship is conservative, with faster inactivation occurring under environmental conditions when Ascaris eggs were suspended in fecal sludge or manure. A specific aerobic relationship was not developed, but we demonstrated that aerobic conditions cause faster inactivation than anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the anaerobic relationship provides a conservative guideline for both conditions. We demonstrate that relatively low temperatures can considerably impact Ascaris viability and suggest that mesophilic temperatures can be used in waste treatment processes to inactivate pathogens. The development of safe, low-input, mesophilic treatment processes is particularly valuable for ensuring universal access to safe sanitation and excreta management.", "Development and validation of a physiologically based kinetic model for starting up and operation of the biological gas desulfurization process under haloalkaline conditions ": "Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic and corrosive gas that must be removed from gaseous hydrocarbon streams prior to combustion. This paper describes a gas biodesulfurization process where sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) facilitate sulfide conversion to both sulfur and sulfate. In order to optimize the formation of sulfur, it is crucial to understand the relations between the SOB microbial composition, kinetics of biological and abiotic sulfide oxidation and the effects on the biodesulfurization process efficiency. Hence, a physiologically based kinetic model was developed for four different inocula. The resulting model can be used as a tool to evaluate biodesulfurization process performance. The model relies on a ratio of two key enzymes involved in the sulfide oxidation process, i.e., flavocytochrome c and sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase (FCC and SQR). The model was calibrated by measuring biological sulfide oxidation rates for different inocula obtained from four full-scale biodesulfurization installations fed with gases from various industries. Experimentally obtained biological sulfide oxidation rates showed dissimilarities between the tested biomasses which could be explained by assuming distinctions in the key-enzyme ratios. Hence, we introduce a new model parameter \u03b1 to whereby \u03b1 describes the ratio between the relative expression levels of FCC and SQR enzymes. Our experiments show that sulfur production is the highest at low \u03b1 values.", "Towards high resolution monitoring of water flow velocity using flat flexible thin mm-sized resistance-typed sensor film (MRSF) ": "Novel flexible thin mm-sized resistance-typed sensor film (MRSF) fabricated using ink-jet printing technology (IPT) was developed in this study to monitor water flow rate in pipelines in real time in situ mode. The mechanism of MRSF is that the mm-sized interdigitated electrodes made by printing silver nanoparticles on an elastic polyimide film bend under different flow rates, leading to variation of the resistance of the sensor at different degrees of curvature. Continuous flow tests showed that MRSF possessed a high accuracy (0.2\u202fm/s) and excellent sensitivity (0.1447/ms\u22121). A model of sensor resistance and flow velocity was established to unfold the correlation between the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and the mechanic flexibility of sensor materials. An analytical model yielded a high coefficient of determination (R2\u202f>\u202f0.93) for the relationship between the resistance increment of the MRSF and the square of the flow velocity at the velocity range of 0.25\u20132\u202fm/s. Furthermore, a temperature-correction model was developed to quantify the effect of water temperature on the sensor resistance readings. MRSF exhibited a low temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR, 0.001) at the water temperature range of 20\u201360\u202f\u00b0C. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the finite element method were conducted and confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions. High-resolution monitoring of water flow rate using MRSF technology was expected to save at least 50% energy consumption for a given unit, especially under flow fluctuation. MRSF possesses a great potential to perform real-time in situ monitoring at high accuracy with ultralow cost, thus enabling the feedback control at high spatiotemporal resolution to reduce the overall energy consumption in water and wastewater systems.", "Improving water-efficient irrigation: Prospects and difficulties of innovative practices ": "Innovative irrigation practices can enhance water efficiency, gaining an economic advantage while also reducing environmental burdens. In some cases the necessary knowledge has been provided by extension services, helping farmers to adapt and implement viable solutions, thus gaining more benefits from irrigation technology. Often investment in technological improvements has incurred higher water prices, however, without gaining the full potential benefits through water efficiency. Farmers generally lack adequate means and incentives to know crops\u2019 water use, actual irrigation applications, crops\u2019 yield response to different water management practices, and thus current on-farm water-efficiency levels.\n                  Those general difficulties are illustrated by our two case studies investigating options, stimuli and difficulties to improve water-efficient practices. The two areas have strong stimuli for improvement but lack a knowledge-exchange system to help farmers and resource managers identify scope for improvements. Partly for this reason, farmers\u2019 responsibility for efficient water management has been displaced to hypothetical prospects, e.g. extra supplies from reuse of treated wastewater or a long-term low water pricing. In both cases a displaced responsibility complements the default assumption that farmers\u2019 irrigation practices already have adequate water-use efficiency. Under current circumstances, agricultural water management will maintain the unknown water-efficiency level and farmers will have weaker incentives to make efforts for more efficient practices. A continuous knowledge-exchange is necessary so that all relevant stakeholders can share greater responsibility across the entire water-supply chain. On this basis, more water-efficient management could combine wider environmental benefits with economic advantage for farmers.", "Adaptation strategies for agricultural water management under climate change in Europe ": "Climate change is expected to intensify the existing risks, particularly in regions where water scarcity is already a concern, as well as create new opportunities in some areas. Efforts to develop adaptation strategies for agricultural water management can benefit from understanding the risks and adaptation strategies proposed to date. This understanding may assist in developing priorities for the adaptation of water resources for irrigation. Here we characterise the main risks across European regions and evaluate adaptation strategies by reviewing over 168 highly relevant publications that appeared in the last 15 years. Based on this extensive database we characterise the effort and benefit of a number of agronomic and policy measures, aiming to develop concrete adaptation plans and responding to concrete regional challenges. The adaptation choices consider current technological perspectives and do not project future technological change; we are certain that technological change will shape some choices for adaptation in the coming decades. The greatest scope for action is in improving adaptive capacity and responding to changes in water demands, however the implementation requires revamping current water policy, adequate training to farmers and viable financial instruments. These results aim to assist stakeholders as they take up the adaptation challenge and develop measures to reduce the vulnerability of the sector to climate change.", "Agro-industrial wastewater reuse for irrigation of a vegetable crop succession under Mediterranean conditions ": "In many countries of the Mediterranean region, characterized by frequent drought periods, agricultural production often occurs under water deficiency or conditions that cause the depletion of the existing water resources. In these areas, the reuse of reclaimed wastewater for crop irrigation could contribute to mitigate/decrease water shortage, support the agriculture sector and protect groundwater resources. In 1.5-year field experiments in Southern Italy (Apulia Region), the effects of irrigation with treated agro-industrial wastewater on soil properties, crops yield and qualitative traits of crop products, including their microbiological safety, were assessed. Groundwater (GW), secondary treated wastewater (SW) and tertiary treated wastewater (TW) from an innovative \u201con-demand\u201d UV disinfection system were used to irrigate tomato and broccoli, cultivated in succession. The three irrigation water sources and the corresponding irrigated soils, plants and crop products were analyzed for the main physico-chemical characteristics, quali-quantitative parameters and fecal indicators. SW and TW showed higher values of the main physico-chemical parameters than GW. SW irrigated soil resulted in a significant increase of NH4-N, Na+, SAR, EC (below the threshold value beyond which a soil is defined as saline) during the first tomato crop cycle, and of pH during the broccoli growing season. Irrigation with treated wastewater did not significantly affect the marketable yield nor the qualitative traits of tomato and broccoli crops, except for the Na+ and NO3\n                     \u2212 content (below the threshold levels defined by the European guidelines for vegetables). High levels of E. coli (above the Italian limit for reuse), Fecal coliforms and Fecal enterococci (up to 104 CFU 100ml\u22121) were observed in the SW and, when chlorination was not done, in the TW. Nevertheless, E. coli was not isolated from any sample of soil, plant and crop product, probably due to its rapid die-off. Moreover, low concentrations of Fecal coliforms and Total heterotrophic count were found in plant and crop product. The drip irrigation system used, which avoided the close contact between water and plant, may have contributed to this. Under the conditions applied in this study, the reuse of treated agro-industrial wastewater for irrigation can be considered an effective way to cope with agricultural water shortage in the Mediterranean area.", "AquaCrop-OS: An open source version of FAO's crop water productivity model ": "Crop simulation models are valuable tools for quantifying crop yield response to water, and for devising strategies to improve agricultural water management. However, applicability of the majority of crop models is limited greatly by a failure to provide open-access to model source code. In this study, we present an open-source version of the FAO AquaCrop model, which simulates efficiently water-limited crop production across diverse environmental and agronomic conditions. Our model, called AquaCrop-OpenSource (AquaCrop-OS), can be run in multiple programming languages and operating systems. Support for parallel execution reduces significantly simulation times when applying the model in large geospatial frameworks, for long-run policy analysis, or for uncertainty assessment. Furthermore, AquaCrop-OS is compliant with the Open Modelling Interface standard facilitating linkage to other disciplinary models, for example to guide integrated water resources planning.", "Long-term sustainability of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in question: An economic assessment of water management alternatives ": "A dense dike system has been built in the upstream floodplains of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, allowing large scale rice production based on compartmentalized fields and optimized water management. Intensive cultivation has enabled farmers to greatly increase their rice productivity and augment the national food bowl. However, flood-control structures have undermined the water retention capacity, compromising various benefits of floodwaters for delta ecosystems. Effects are both internal and external to farming. Negative internal effects are the large investment requirements and higher farming costs. Negative externalities include increased flood damage, reduced sediment flows, saltwater intrusion and riverbank erosion. In this study, we assessed the effects of three dike\u2013agricultural system scenarios on delta-level sustainability, considering both internal and external effects. Direct and indirect costs were estimated using various methodologies and the literature. Our findings show that extensive development of high dikes on the floodplains is the least economical and most ecologically risky alternative. In this scenario, accelerated high-dike construction exacted a cost 136% greater than the situation represented by the baseline year of 2011. Externalities in this scenario contributed to rising economic losses in both aquaculture and agriculture. The scenario of transforming high-dike into low-dike systems revealed lower water management costs combined with lesser environmental impacts and greater capacity to exploit floodwater benefits. Our findings provide a useful input for decision-makers considering the unintended economic consequences of existing water management strategies. They support a transition to low-dike farming systems for a more sustainable delta.", "Water scarcity: Fact or fiction? ": "It is surprisingly difficult to determine whether water is truly scarce in the physical sense at a global scale (a supply problem) or whether it is available but should be used better (a demand problem). The paper reviews water scarcity indicators and global assessments based on these indicators. The most widely used indicator, the Falkenmark indicator, is popular because it is easy to apply and understand but it does not help to explain the true nature of water scarcity. The more complex indicators are not widely applied because data are lacking to apply them and the definitions are not intuitive. Water is definitely physically scarce in densely populated arid areas, Central and West Asia, and North Africa, with projected availabilities of less than 1000m3/capita/year. This scarcity relates to water for food production, however, and not to water for domestic purposes that are minute at this scale. In most of the rest of the world water scarcity at a national scale has as much to do with the development of the demand as the availability of the supply. Accounting for water for environmental requirements shows that abstraction of water for domestic, food and industrial uses already have a major impact on ecosystems in many parts of the world, even those not considered \u201cwater scarce\u201d. Water will be a major constraint for agriculture in coming decades and particularly in Asia and Africa this will require major institutional adjustments. A \u201csoft path\u201d to address water scarcity, focusing on increasing overall water productivity, is recommended.", "Model of crop growth, water flow, and solute transport in layered soil ": "Agro-eco-hydrological models are essential for managing scarce water resources and ensuring crop productivity. Here, a one-dimensional agro-eco-hydrological model, LAWSTAC, capable of simulating water and solute transport in layered soil coupled with crop growth, is presented and validated. LAWSTAC considers eight hydraulic conductivity discretization methods to address the nonlinearity of Richards equation for soil water flow. LAWSTAC includes two root water uptake models and a flexible root distribution model for reliable transpiration simulation. Simulation of infiltration in layered soil demonstrated that the methods of arithmetic mean, geometric mean and triadic mean performed well among the eight discretization methods. The model was further verified by comparison with results from two widely used models, HYDRUS-1D and SWAP, based on the measured data in a spring wheat field for 2007 and 2008 in the Northwest China. The models produced similar results for flow in layered soil, although SWAP showed some instability in the salinity dynamics. LAWSTAC models crop growth with a more efficient parameterization than SWAP. The root mean square error for soil moisture, soil salinity concentration and LAI simulated by LAWSTAC was less than 0.06\u2009cm3\u2009cm\u22123, 3.56\u2009g L-1, and 0.43, respectively. In conclusion, LAWSTAC is suitable for simulating soil water and salinity dynamics, crop growth and their interactions.", "Assessing the environmental sustainability of irrigation with oil and gas produced water in drylands ": "Produced water (PW) is the largest by-product of the oil and gas industry. Its management is both economically and environmentally costly. PW reuse for irrigation offers an alternative to current disposal practices while providing water to irrigators in drylands. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the environmental effects of irrigation with PW. The SALTIRSOIL_M model was used to simulate the irrigation of sugar beet with 15 PWs of a wide range of qualities in four climates of different aridity and on four contrasting soil types. The impacts on soil salinity, sodicity and pH as well as on crop yield and drainage water salinity were estimated. Well-drained soils with low water content at field capacity (Arenosol) are less sensitive to salinisation while a relatively high gypsum content (Gypsisol) makes the soil less vulnerable to both sodification and salinisation. On the contrary, clayey soils with higher water content at field capacity and lower gypsum content must be avoided as the soil structural stability as well as a tolerable soil electrical conductivity for the crop cannot be maintained on the long-term. Soil pH was not found to be sensitive to PW quality. Drainage water quality was found to be closely linked to PW quality although it is also influenced by the soil type. The impact of drainage water on the aquifer must be considered and reuse or disposal implemented accordingly for achieving sustainable irrigation. Finally, increasing aridity intensifies soil and drainage water salinity and sodicity. This investigation highlights the importance of adapting the existing irrigation water quality guidelines through the use of models to include relevant parameters related to soil type and aridity. Indeed, it will support the petroleum industry and irrigators, to estimate the risks due to watering crops with PW and will encourage its sustainable reuse in water-scarce areas.", "Differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on agricultural production in Nigeria: Any lessons for climate-smart agriculture? ": "The rain-fed agriculture system is vulnerable to climate change impact. However, such impact may also vary by aggregate and sub-sectoral levels of agricultural production. The impact of climate change and variability on agricultural production would engender appropriate policies and practices towards a sustainable agricultural production system. We investigated the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on agricultural production in Nigeria, and drew lessons for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Nigeria. Using time series data that spanned 43 years and econometric analytical technique, we quantified the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on aggregate production and sub-sectors (all crops, staples, livestock, fisheries and forestry). Irrigation had positive and significant impact on aggregate agricultural production as well as all sub-sectors of agriculture. These findings suggest the need for the minimization of the impact of climate-induced production risks through CSA which would involve complementary development of more arable land areas under irrigation in Nigeria. Irrigation would also enhance complementary agricultural water management for the development of all the sub-sectors of agriculture, thereby enhancing food security and sustainable agricultural production under prevailing climate change and variability.", "Drought response in field grown potatoes and the interactions between canopy growth and yield ": "Potato is an important food crop with high yields. However when exposed to drought it suffers major yield losses. Considering its global importance and the increasing incidence of drought due to climate change, research toward drought tolerance in potato remains imperative. We have studied a set of 103 commercial cultivars representing the genetic diversity in the European potato market. The cultivars were grown in different field locations in three subsequent years (2013\u20132015). Our aim was to understand how different field drought regimes affect canopy growth in potato, and how these effects translate to tuber yield. The field environmental conditions were monitored, and pictures of canopy ground cover during the growing season were taken. Canopy growth parameters were extracted by an iterative method using the beta sigmoid growth function to model canopy growth. At harvest, tuber yield was scored and tuber size was graded. The GGE (Genotype and Genotype-by-Environment) bi-plot and Finlay Wilkinson\u2019s Regression were used to investigate Genotype x Environment interactions. We observed that the timing of the drought occurrence differentially affected canopy growth and tuber yield. Under drought stress, fast attainment of exponential growth and maximum canopy cover had negative effects on tuber formation and tuber bulking. Growth rate, maximum canopy cover, and area under the canopy curve (photosynthetic capacity over the growth season) were more important for tuber bulking than they were for tuber formation under drought stress. Cultivars with high yield were identified as potential material for improvement to drought tolerance. These findings will contribute to the breeding for drought-tolerant potato amidst the threats of climate change.", "Evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of continuous maize and maize and soybean in rotation in the upper Midwest U.S. ": "This study examined evapotranspiration (ET) from no-till, rainfed maize and soybean during three growing seasons (May-Sep) of normal rainfall years (2009, 2010, 2011) and a drought year (2012) in Michigan, USA, based on daily soil water uptake measured by time-domain reflectometry at multiple depths through the root zone. During normal rainfall years, growing-season ET was similar between continuous maize (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation: 471\u2009\u00b1\u200947\u2009mm) and maize in rotation (469\u2009\u00b1\u200951\u2009mm). During the drought year, ET decreased by only 3% for continuous maize but by 20% for maize in rotation. During the normal rainfall years, ET for soybean (453\u2009\u00b1\u200934\u2009mm) was statistically indistinguishable from ET for maize, and was lower during the drought year (333\u2009mm). Water use efficiency (WUE), calculated from harvest yield (grain\u2009+\u2009corn stover) and ET, was 25.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm-1 for continuous maize and 27.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121 for maize in rotation during the normal rainfall years, whereas WUEs for both continuous maize and maize in rotation were much lower in the 2012 drought year (14.0 and 15.5\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121, respectively), coincident with lower production. Soybean had a much lower WUE than maize during the three normal years (6.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121) and the drought year (4.57\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121), also explained by lower yield. Both maize and soybean tended to use all available water in the soil profile; there was no consistent difference in ET between these crops, while yield varied markedly from year to year.", "Deficit irrigation and emerging fruit crops as a strategy to save water in Mediterranean semiarid agrosystems ": "Water scarcity in Mediterranean climate areas will be progressively aggravated by climate change, population increase and urban, tourism and industrial activities. To protect water resources and their integrity for future use and to improve biodiversity, besides following advanced deficit irrigation strategies in fruit cultivation, attention could well be directed towards what are at present underused plant materials able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality. To this end, the state of the art as regards deficit irrigation strategies and the response of some very interesting emerging fruit crops [jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.), loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.), pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) and pomegranate (Punica granatum L.)] are reviewed. The strengths and weaknesses of deficit irrigation strategies and the mechanisms developed by these emerging fruit crops in the face of water stress are discussed. The response of these crops to deficit irrigation, with special attention paid to the effect on yield but also on fruit quality and health-related chemical compounds, was analysed in order to assess their suitability for saving water in Mediterranean semiarid agrosystems and to analyze their potential role as alternatives to currently cultivated fruit crops with higher water requirements. Finally, the factors involved in establishing an identity brand (hydroSOS) to protect fruits obtained under specific DI conditions are discussed.", "A review of coupled hydrologic and crop growth models ": "Coupling hydrologic and crop models is becoming an increasingly important approach in the development of agro-hydrologic theme. Scientists and decision makers working to address issues in the areas of resource conservation and agricultural productivity are interested in the complementary processing of the two coupled systems. The objective of the present work is to review relevant studies related to hydrologic and crop models coupling, and to analyze the domain applicability, limitations, and other considerations.", "Understanding clients, providers and the institutional dimensions of irrigation services in developing countries: A study of water markets in Bangladesh ": "Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated nations that nonetheless has largely achieved staple self-sufficiency. This development has been enabled in part by the rapid proliferation of small-scale irrigation pumps that enabled double rice cropping, as well as by a competitive market system in which farmers purchase water at affordable fee-for-service prices from private irrigation pump owners. Excess groundwater abstraction in areas of high shallow tube-well density and increased fuel costs for pumping have however called into question the sustainability of Bangladesh\u2019s groundwater irrigation economy. Cost-saving agronomic methods are called for, alongside aligned policies, markets, and farmers\u2019 incentives. The study assesses different institutions and water-pricing methods for irrigation services that have emerged in Bangladesh, each of which varies in their incentive structure for water conservation, and the level of economic risk involved for farmers and service providers. Using primary data collected from 139 irrigation service providers and 556 client-farmers, we empirically examine the structure of irrigation service types and associated market and institutional dimensions. Our findings demonstrate that competition among pump owners, social capital and personal relationships, and economic and agronomic risk perceptions of both pump owners and farmers significantly influence the structure of irrigation services and water pricing methods. Greater competition among pump owners increases the likelihood of pay-per-hour services and reduces the likelihood of crop harvest sharing arrangements. Based on these findings, we explore policy implications for enhancing irrigation services and irrigation sustainability in Bangladesh.", "Impacts of plastic film mulching on crop yields, soil water, nitrate, and organic carbon in Northwestern China: A meta-analysis ": "In order to increase crop yield in semi-arid and arid areas, plastic film mulching (PFM) is widely used in Northwestern China. To date, many studies have addressed the effects of PFM on soil physical and biochemical properties in rain-fed agriculture in Northwestern China, but the findings of different studies are often contradictory. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the impacts of PFM on soil water content, soil nutrients and food production is needed. We compiled the results of 1278 observations to evaluate the overall effects of PFM on soil water content, the distribution of nitrate and soil organic carbon, and crop yield in rain-fed agriculture in Northwestern China. Our results showed that PFM increased soil moisture and nitrate concentration in topsoils (0\u201320\u202fcm) by 12.9% and 28.2%, respectively, but slightly decreased (1.8%) soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the 0\u201310\u202fcm soil layer. PFM significantly increased grain yields by 43.1%, with greatest effect in spring maize (79.4%). When related to cumulative precipitation during the crop growing season, yield increase from PFM was greatest (72.8%) at 200\u2013300\u202fmm, which was attributed to the large increase for spring maize and potato, implying that crop zoning would be beneficial for PFM in this region. When related to N application rate, crop yields benefited most from PFM (80.2%) at 200\u2013300\u202fkg/ha. A cost-benefit analysis indicated that PFM increased economic return by an average of 29.5%, with the best improvement for spring maize (71.1%) and no increase for spring wheat. In conclusion, PFM can significantly increase crop yield and economic return (especially for spring maize) in rain-fed agriculture areas of Northwestern China. Crop zoning is recommended for PFM to achieve the largest economic benefit. However, full account needs to be taken of the environmental impacts relating to N loss, SOC depletion and film pollution to evaluate the sustainability of PFM systems and further research is required to quantify and mitigate these impacts.", "Cucumber (Cucumis sativus, L.) water use efficiency (WUE) under plastic mulch and drip irrigation ": "To study the effect of two types of plastic mulch (transparent and black) with drip irrigation on water requirement and Cucumber (Cucumis sativus, L.) yield, in addition to their effect on Maturity time. Trials were carried out at Teezen Research Station, Hama Agricultural Research Center, GCSAR, Syria, during 2009\u20132010 growing seasons using complete randomized block design with three replicates. Soil characteristics were followed too because they reflect the effects of plastic mulch. Treatments were transparent mulched drip irrigation (DI+TM), black mulched drip irrigation (DI+BM), drip irrigation without mulching (DI) and surface furrow irrigation (SI). The results of the study indicated that (DI+TM) treatment excelled all other treatments at yield and water use efficiency (WUE), where its yield was 63.9tha\u22121, and (WUE) was 0.262tha\u22121\n                     mm\u22121, while (DI+BM) treatment produced 57.9tha\u22121, with a (WUE) of 0.238tha\u22121\n                     mm\u22121. However cucumber yield and WUE declined in the remaining treatments of no mulch (DI) and (SI) to reach 44.1tha\u22121 with 0.153tha\u22121\n                     mm\u22121 and 37.7tha\u22121 with 0.056tha\u22121\n                     mm\u22121, respectively. The results showed that (DI+TM) treatment gave the highest soil temperature and moisture during both of the seasons in comparison to (DI+BM). This enhanced its vegetative growth and almost doubled its productivity compared to the SI treatment.", "The dynamics of the relationship between household decision-making and farm household income in small-scale irrigation schemes in southern Africa ": "Irrigation has been promoted as a strategy to reduce poverty and improve livelihoods in southern Africa. Households\u2019 livelihood strategies within small-scale irrigation schemes have become increasingly complex and diversified. Strategies consist of farm income from rain-fed and irrigated cropping as well as livestock and an increasing dependence on off-farm income. The success of these strategies depends on the household\u2019s ability to make decisions about how to utilize its\u2019 financial, labour, land and water resources. This study explores the dynamics of decision-making in households on-farm household income within six small-scale irrigation schemes, across three southern African countries. Household survey data (n\u2009=\u2009402) was analyzed using ordered probit and ordinary least squares regression. Focus group discussions and field observations provided qualitative data on decision-making in the six schemes. We found strong support for the notion that decision-making dynamics strongly influence total household income. Households make trade-offs between irrigation, dryland, livestock and off-farm work when they allocate their labour resources to maximize household income; as opposed to maximizing the income from any individual component of their livelihood strategy, such as irrigation. Combined with the impact of the small plot size of irrigated land, this is likely to result in sub-optimal benefits from expensive investments in irrigation infrastructure. Policy-makers must consider this when developing and implementing new policies.", "UAVs challenge to assess water stress for sustainable agriculture ": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present an exciting opportunity to monitor crop fields with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing capable of improving water stress management in agriculture. In this study, we reviewed the application of different types of UAVs using different remote sensors and compared their performance with ground-truth plant data. Several reflectance indices, such as NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI and PRInorm obtained from UAVs have shown positive correlations related to water stress indicators such as water potential (\u03a8) and stomatal conductance (g\n                     \n                        s\n                     ). Nevertheless, they have performed differently in diverse crops; thus, their uses and applications are also discussed in this study. Thermal imagery is also a common remote sensing technology used to assess water stress in plants, via thermal indices (calculated using artificial surfaces as references), estimates of the difference between canopy and air temperature, and even canopy conductance estimates derived from leaf energy balance models. These indices have shown a great potential to determine field stress heterogeneity using unmanned aerial platforms. It has also been proposed that chlorophyll fluorescence could be an even better indicator of plant photosynthesis and water use efficiency under water stress. Therefore, developing systems and methodologies to easily retrieve fluorescence from UAVs should be a priority for the near future. After a decade of work with UAVs, recently emerging technologies have developed more user-friendly aerial platforms, such as the multi-copters, which offer industry, science, and society new opportunities. Their use as high-throughput phenotyping platforms for real field conditions and also for water stress management increasing temporal and resolution scales could improve our capacity to determine important crop traits such as yield or stress tolerance for breeding purposes.", "Assessment of meteorological and agricultural droughts using in-situ observations and remote sensing data ": "Most research on drought assessment adopted historical in-situ observations, however, there has been increased data availability from remote sensing during the recent years. This study utilizes the two sources of data in drought assessment. Using the historical in-situ observations, the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological drought were firstly investigated by calculating the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at 1, 3, 6-month time scales in Northeast China. Using remote sensing data, the combined deficit index (CDI) for agricultural drought assessment was computed based on tri-monthly sum of deficit in antecedent rainfall and deficit in monthly NDVI at land cover type and sub-type levels in the same region. In the end, the agricultural drought calculated by the CDI was evaluated against the deficit in crop yield, as well as deficit in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET), in order to verify the applicability of the CDI for agricultural drought assessment in the study region. The results showed that the CDI has better correlations with the SPEI (R2\u202f=\u202f0.48) than the SPI (R2\u202f=\u202f0.05) at 3-month scales with weight factor a\u202f=\u202f0.5 in dry farming areas. The spatial pattern of the CDI showed that the area of agricultural drought increased from July to October. In addition, a significant linear correlation was found between the CDI and anomaly in annual agricultural yield (R2\u202f=\u202f0.55), and anomaly in monthly land surface temperature (R2\u202f=\u202f0.42). The results prove that the CDI calculated by remote sensing data is not only a reliable indicator for agricultural drought assessment in Northeast China, but also provides useful information for agricultural drought disaster prevention and mitigation, and water management improvement.", "Treated agro-industrial wastewater irrigation of tomato crop: Effects on qualitative/quantitative characteristics of production and microbiological properties of the soil ": "A comparative study was carried out to evaluate the effects of two water irrigation sources on the quality and microbiological safety of tomato plants and fruit, and on the microbiological soil properties: irrigation with groundwater (GW) and with treated agro-industrial wastewater (TW). In a field experiment in southern Italy (Apulia region), the physico-chemical characteristics of the irrigation waters and the fruit quality parameters were determined. Escherichia coli, fecal Enterococci and Salmonella spp. were also monitored in the irrigation waters, tomato plant and fruit, and root-zone soil. Bacteriological analysis for total heterotrophic counts (THCs) were determined for plant, fruit, and soil samples. The irrigation water source did not significantly affect yield quantitative traits. However, with GW, the marketable fruit yield was higher than with TW (\u223c82 vs. \u223c79Mgha\u22121, respectively). For both irrigation treatments, the most important qualitative parameters that characterize the processing tomato fruit (i.e., dry matter content, pH, soluble solid content, color parameters) were in agreement with reports in the literature. For the microbiological results, the mean levels of E. coli and fecal Enterococci were 4408 and 3804CFU 100ml\u22121, respectively, for TW (above the Italian guidelines for TW re-use). For the tomato plant and fruit, no E. coli isolated in either, and fecal coliforms and THC were not influenced by the irrigation waters (P\n                     >0.05). Total bacterial enumeration by quantitative PCR was lower in soil irrigated with GW, than TW (3.69 vs. 4.02, \u00d7106, respectively). Moreover, soil microbial community patterns substantially differed between the two water treatments. These data show that while fecal indicators are not affected, the community composition and dynamics of the whole bacterial population in soil is influenced by the different qualities of these waters used for irrigation.", "Urban agriculture and small farm water use: Case studies and trends from Cache Valley, Utah ": "The landscape of water in Utah is changing due to population growth, conversion of agricultural land to urban development, and increasing awareness of water scarcity. At the same time, Utah is experiencing a growing number of urban and small farms, but knowledge of water use in this sector is limited. Better understanding of what occurs at the field level on urban and small farms can aid state water use estimates and conservation efforts, and assist farmers in moving towards wiser water management. For the 2015 growing season, we performed irrigation evaluations for 24 urban and small farms in Cache Valley, Utah and we explore the results through case studies and identify trends among gross irrigation depth and field variables including field size, irrigation method, application uniformity, and scheduling practices. Results show a great degree of heterogeneity in irrigation methods, equipment used, and management practices. The beneficial consumed fraction of irrigation water ranged from 0.06 to 1.0. Small fields had lower application uniformities and greater irrigation depths than large fields. Surface irrigated fields had higher irrigation depths than sprinkle and drip irrigated fields. Additionally, fields using a fixed irrigation schedule had higher depths than fields that were irrigated inconsistently due to other factors. The results show that urban and small farm irrigators need improved knowledge of proper irrigation management. Irrigators, university extension services, and state water authorities working in this sector need to recognize the link between proper management and total water use, and focus more efforts on improving management, specifically how to use 1) low-cost methods to measure flow rates, 2) simple irrigation scheduling tools, and 3) improve application uniformity.", "Evapotranspiration over a rainfed maize field in northeast China: How are relationships between the environment and terrestrial evapotranspiration mediated by leaf area? ": "As a central process in the hydrological system and the climate system, terrestrial evapotranspiration is a key factor furthering our understanding of the climate change processes. Knowledge of factors controlling the variability in evapotranspiration is crucial for the prediction of the fate of terrestrial ecosystems under environmental changes. Based on long-term (2005\u20132014) eddy covariance flux data observed at a rainfed maize site in northeast China, the purpose of this study was to clarify the environmental regulation of actual evapotranspiration (ET) and the extent to which the regulatory effects on ET are directly or indirectly mediated by changes in biotic factors, using the structural equation modeling (SEM) method. The results showed that annual total ET was 397\u2009\u00b1\u200935\u2009mm for the rainfed maize site in comparison with 575\u2009\u00b1\u2009169\u2009mm of precipitation (Prec), with an ET/Prec ratio ranging from 0.43 (2012) to 1.14 (2014). It was revealed that net radiation (Rn) was the primary controlling factor of the maize ET, followed by leaf area index (LAI), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature (Ta), and soil water content (SWC). The adjusted SEM models explained 71%, 67%, and 67% of the variation in daily ET of the maize growing season (ETgs) for dry, normal, and moist years, respectively. Rn and VPD dominated ETgs in an increasing order of dry, normal, and moist years. Conversely, the effects of LAI and Ta on ETgs followed the opposite trend. This indicated that drought may increase the sensitivity of maize ET to temperature changes, and decrease the sensitivity of maize ET to radiation changes. In SEM analysis, LAI played an important mediating role in the relationship among climate, soil variables, and ETgs. Rn, VPD, Ta, and SWC all had significant indirect effects on ETgs mediated through LAI. At the annual scale, it was identified that most active days could be a robust predictor of annual ET.", "Effects of potassium rates and types on growth, leaf gas exchange and biochemical changes in rice (Oryza sativa) planted under cyclic water stress ": "Three levels of potassium rates [80kgK2Oha\u22121, 120kgK2Oha\u22121 and 160kgK2Oha\u22121) and two types potassium (KCl and K2SO4) on rice under cyclic water stress 15 days and the absolute control (80kgK2Oha\u22121 of KCl fertilizer on rice under control flooded) were exposed to rice to investigate the influence of potassium in minimizing cyclic water stress effects in rice. It was found as fertilization rates increased from 80>120>160kgK2Oha\u22121 the production of proline was increased. The increase in proline production was simultaneously enhanced the production of Catalase and Maliondialdehyde. As the potassium rate increased from 80>120>160kgK2Oha\u22121, the transpiration rate was observed to be increased in both potassium types. The result suggested that high potassium rates would reduce water stress effects by having high transpiration rate. High transpiration rate would increase the nutrient uptake that would repair the damage tissue under water stress thus reduce the oxidative stress of rice under water stress condition. This been showed by high significant positive correlations of transpiration rate with CAT activity (r\n                     =0.871; p\n                     \u22640.05), MDA (r\n                     =0.914; p\n                     \u22640.05) and Proline (r\n                     =0.842; p\n                     \u22640.05). It was found that the increase of K rates by KCl increased NAR higher than the increased K rates in K2SO4. This might be due to higher absorption of K element in rice by KCl compared to K2SO4. The study has showed that application of potassium either KCl or K2SO4 would minimize the effects on rice growth and physiology under cyclic water stress. The current study also suggested that plant tolerate to cyclic water stress by increased the production of proline, MDA and decrease of Catalase activity to protect the plant from damage from water stress.", "A WEAP-MODFLOW surface water-groundwater model for the irrigated Miyandoab plain, Urmia lake basin, Iran: Multi-objective calibration and quantification of historical drought impacts ": "This study develops and applies the first coupled surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) flow model for the irrigated Miyandoab plain located in the Urmia basin, in the northwest of Iran. The model is implemented using a dynamic coupling between MODFLOW and WEAP and consists of spatially distributed monthly water balances for the aquifer, root-zone, rivers, canals, and reservoirs. Multi-objective calibration of the model using river discharge and GW level data yields accurate simulation of historical conditions, and results in better constrained parameters compared to using either data source alone. Model simulations show that crop water demand cannot be met during droughts due to limited GW pumping capacity, and that increased GW pumping has a relatively strong impact on GW levels due to the small specific yield of the aquifer. The SW-GW model provides a unique tool for exploring management options that sustain agricultural production and downstream flow to the shrinking Urmia Lake.", "Irrigation management under water scarcity ": "The use of water for agricultural production in water scarcity regions requires innovative and sustainable research, and an appropriate transfer of technologies. This paper discusses some of these aspects, mainly relative to on-farm irrigation management including the use of treated wastewater and saline waters. First, the paper proposes some concepts relative to water scarcity, concerning aridity, drought, desertification and water shortage, as well as policies to cope with these water stressed regimes. Conceptual approaches on irrigation performances, water use and water savings are reviewed in a wide perspective. This is followed by a discussion of supply management to cope with water scarcity, giving particular attention to the use of wastewater and low-quality waters, including the respective impacts on health and the environment as water scarcity is requiring that waters of inferior quality be increasingly used for irrigation. The paper then focuses on demand management, starting with aspects relating to the improvement of irrigation methods and the respective performances, mainly the distribution uniformity (DU) as a fundamental tool to reduce the demand for water at the farm level, and to control the negative environmental impacts of over-irrigation, including salt stressed areas. Discussions are supported by recent research results. The suitability of irrigation methods for using treated wastewaters and saline waters is analysed. Supplemental irrigation (SI) and deficit irrigation strategies are also discussed, including limitations on the applicability of related practices. The paper also identifies the need to adopt emerging technologies for water management as well as to develop appropriate methodologies for the analysis of social, economic, and environmental benefits of improved irrigation management.", "Pore-scale imaging and modelling ": "Pore-scale imaging and modelling \u2013 digital core analysis \u2013 is becoming a routine service in the oil and gas industry, and has potential applications in contaminant transport and carbon dioxide storage. This paper briefly describes the underlying technology, namely imaging of the pore space of rocks from the nanometre scale upwards, coupled with a suite of different numerical techniques for simulating single and multiphase flow and transport through these images. Three example applications are then described, illustrating the range of scientific problems that can be tackled: dispersion in different rock samples that predicts the anomalous transport behaviour characteristic of highly heterogeneous carbonates; imaging of super-critical carbon dioxide in sandstone to demonstrate the possibility of capillary trapping in geological carbon storage; and the computation of relative permeability for mixed-wet carbonates and implications for oilfield waterflood recovery. The paper concludes by discussing limitations and challenges, including finding representative samples, imaging and simulating flow and transport in pore spaces over many orders of magnitude in size, the determination of wettability, and upscaling to the field scale. We conclude that pore-scale modelling is likely to become more widely applied in the oil industry including assessment of unconventional oil and gas resources. It has the potential to transform our understanding of multiphase flow processes, facilitating more efficient oil and gas recovery, effective contaminant removal and safe carbon dioxide storage.", "Green-blue water accounting in a soil water balance ": "It has become common practice to speak about \u2018green\u2019 versus \u2018blue\u2019 water consumption, in order to distinguish between consumption of rainwater versus groundwater or surface water. The two sources of water differ in terms of possibilities for storage and use. Whereas industrial, municipal and livestock water supply primarily depend on blue water, crop cultivation relies on both green and blue water. Discriminating between green and blue water consumption in a crop field is not straightforward: consumption refers to evapotranspiration (ET) and water contained in the harvested crop, which both appear in undifferentiated form. One cannot see which part of ET or the water in a plant originates from rainwater and which part from irrigation water. In this paper I propose a generic and physically based method to differentiate green and blue evaporation (E) and green and blue transpiration (T) by daily accounting of the fractions green and blue water in each soil and vegetation layer. The green and blue fractions of all water fluxes leaving a soil or vegetation layer in a day depend on the average green and blue water fractions in that soil or vegetation layer during that day. This method allows for an accurate assessment of irrigation efficiency (the ratio of blue water transpiration to the irrigation water applied), and for a precise estimation of green and blue water footprints of crop production (the ratio of either green ET or blue ET to the crop yield).", "Development and evaluation of a framework for global flood hazard mapping ": "Nowadays, the development of high-resolution flood hazard models have become feasible at continental and global scale, and their application in developing countries and data-scarce regions can be extremely helpful to increase preparedness of population and reduce catastrophic impacts.\n                  The present work describes the development of a novel procedure for global flood hazard mapping, based on the most recent advances in large scale flood modelling. We derive a long-term dataset of daily river discharges from the hydrological simulations of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS). Streamflow data is downscaled on a high resolution river network and processed to provide the input for local flood inundation simulations, performed with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. All flood-prone areas identified along the river network are then merged to create continental flood hazard maps for different return periods at 30\u2032\u2032 resolution. We evaluate the performance of our methodology in several river basins across the globe by comparing simulated flood maps with both official hazard maps and a mosaic of flooded areas detected from satellite images. The evaluation procedure also includes comparisons with the results of other large scale flood models. We further investigate the sensitivity of the flood modelling framework to several parameters and modelling approaches and identify strengths, limitations and possible improvements of the methodology.", "Spatio-temporal analysis of compound hydro-hazard extremes across the\u00a0UK ": "There exists an increasing need to understand the impact of climate change on the hydrological extremes of flood and drought, collectively referred to as \u2018hydro-hazards\u2019. At present, current methodology are limited in their scope, particularly with respect to inadequate representation of the uncertainty in the hydroclimatological modelling chain.\n                  This paper proposes spatially consistent comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the identification of compound hydro-hazard hotspots \u2013 hotspots of change where concurrent increase in mean annual flood and drought events is projected. We apply a quasi-ergodic analysis of variance (QE-ANOVA) framework, to detail both the magnitude and the sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain for the mean projected mean change signal whilst accounting for non-stationarity. The framework is designed for application across a wide geographical range and is thus readily transferable. We illustrate the ability of the framework through application to 239 UK catchments based on hydroclimatological projections from the EDgE project (5 CMI5-GCMs and 3 HMs, forced under RCP8.5).\n                  The results indicate that half of the projected hotspots are temporally concurrent or temporally successive within the year, exacerbating potential impacts on society. The north-east of Scotland and south-west of the UK were identified as spatio-temporally compound hotspot regions and are of particular concern. This intensification of the hydrologic dynamic (timing and seasonality of hydro-hazards) over a limited time frame represents a major challenge for future water management.\n                  Hydrological models were identified as the largest source of variability, in some instances exceeding 80% of the total variance. Critically, clear spatial variability in the sources of modelling uncertainty was also observed; highlighting the need to apply a spatially consistent methodology, such as that presented. This application raises important questions regarding the spatial variability of hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty. In terms of water management planning, such findings allow for more focussed studies with a view to improving the projections which inform the adaptation process.", "Flood risk and its reduction in China ": "Despite massive flood protection efforts in China, undertaken since the ancient times, disastrous floods continue to plague the country. In this paper, we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in China. First, we review published results (including our own works) on change detection in observed records of intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We provide information on essential features of extreme floods in last decades \u2013 floods on large rivers, urban floods, and flash floods. Next, we review available projections for the future (including our own results), related to intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We try to interpret the difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications. Since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large, projections have to be interpreted with caution, because of the impact on decisions related to climate change adaptation, flood risk reduction, and water resources management. We review flood risk reduction strategies in China, focusing on the present situation and division of responsibilities. China has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness, by both structural (\u201chard\u201d) defences, such as: dikes, dams and flood control reservoirs, and diversions, as well as non-structural (\u201csoft\u201d) measures: spatial planning and zoning; watershed management (source control), flood forecasting and warning systems; and awareness raising. The strategy of flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding.", "Pore occupancy, relative permeability and flow intermittency measurements using X-ray micro-tomography in a complex carbonate ": "We imaged the steady-state flow of brine and decane (oil) at different fractional flows during dual injection in a micro-porous limestone, Estaillades, using X-ray micro-tomography. We applied differential imaging to: (a) distinguish micro-porous regions from macro-pores, and (b) determine fluid pore occupancy in both regions, and relative permeability at a capillary number, Ca\u00a0=\u00a07.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126. The sample porosity was approximately 28%, with 7% in macro-pores and 21% in pores that could not be directly resolved (micro-porosity). Fluid occupancy in micro-porosity was classified into three sub-phases: micro-pore space with oil, micro-pore space with brine, and micro-pores partially filled with oil and brine. Our method indicated an initially higher oil recovery from micro-porosity, consistent with waterflooding in a water-wet rock. The fractional flow and relative permeabilities of the two fluids were obtained from measurements of the pressure differential across the sample and the saturation calculated from the images. The brine saturation and relative permeabilities are impacted by the presence of water-wet micro-porosity which provides additional connectivity to the phases. Furthermore, we find that in addition to brine and decane, a fraction of the macroscopic pore space contains an intermittent phase, which is occupied either by brine or decane during the hour-long scan time. Pore and throat occupancy of oil, brine and intermittent phase were obtained from images at different fractional flows using the generalized pore network extracted from the image of macro-pores. The intermittent phase, where the occupancy fluctuated between oil-filled and brine-filled, was predominantly located in the small and intermediate size pores and throats. Overall, we establish a new experimental methodology to: (i) quantify initial and recovered oil in micro-pores, (ii) characterise intermittent flow, and (iii) measure steady-state relative permeability in carbonates, which is shown to be greatly influenced by micro-porosity.", "Assessing seasonal drought variations and trends over Central Europe ": "The relevance of drought is still often underestimated for temperate climate regions like Central Europe that are characterized by on average ample precipitation. Nonetheless, several drought events in recent years (e.g. 1992, 2003, 2015 and 2018) demonstrated that droughts are a relevant factor for several economic activities (e.g., agriculture, water dependent industries, energy supply, etc.) in Central Europe. This is particularly true for the vegetation period, where increasing evapotranspiration rates due to rising atmospheric temperatures are intensifying existing drought conditions that originally developed from rainfalls deficits. The contribution of this study is an assessment of the long-term variability of drought conditions and seasonal climate trends within 1951\u20132015 based on a collective of 91 climate stations from the national meteorological services of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. Using a set of eight drought and three heavy precipitation indices an aggregated evaluation of seasonal precipitation characteristics is done and the driest seasons are identified for the entire study area as well as for four sub-regions. It is shown that the choice of the study period matters (1951\u20132015 vs. 1961\u20132015) as the pronounced (multi-)decadal variability of drought conditions restricts the temporal stability of computed trends. The drought trends computed for 1951\u20132015 are similar in direction, but generally smaller in magnitude than those of the ten year shorter period 1961\u20132015, as the 1950s have been a very dry decade in Central Europe. Seasonally, drying trends were observed for spring and less pronounced for summer, while autumn and winter show wetting trends. The seasonal trends are sensitive to shifts in the season definition by one month. Vegetation period I (VP-I) shows stronger drying trends, but less increases in heavy precipitation than spring, while the drought trends are less pronounced in vegetation period II (VP-II) as compared to the summer season, but more trends towards heavy precipitation increases occur in VP-II. These differences are explained by the daily trends in the seasonal cycle that show the strongest drying in April, June and the beginning of August and the strongest wetting in March and September. Generally, heavy precipitation increases prevail over decreasing trends in all seasons, whereby stations with strong drought trends generally have smaller positive or even negative heavy precipitation trends. A simultaneous occurrence of drought and heavy precipitation increases is observed in spring at several stations, particularly in sub-region West.", "The water footprint of wood for lumber, pulp, paper, fuel and firewood ": "This paper presents the first estimate of global water use in the forestry sector related to roundwood production for lumber, pulp, paper, fuel and firewood. For the period 1961\u20132010, we estimate forest evaporation at a high spatial resolution level and attribute total water consumption to various forest products, including ecosystem services. Global water consumption for roundwood production increased by 25% over 50 years to 961\u00d7109 m3/y (96% green; 4% blue) in 2001\u20132010. The water footprint per m3 of wood is significantly smaller in (sub)tropical forests compared to temperate/boreal forests, because (sub)tropical forests host relatively more value next to wood production in the form of other ecosystem services. In terms of economic water productivity and energy yield from bio-ethanol per unit of water, roundwood is rather comparable with major food, feed and energy crops. Recycling of wood products could effectively reduce the water footprint of the forestry sector, thereby leaving more water available for the generation of other ecosystem services. Intensification of wood production can only reduce the water footprint per unit of wood if the additional wood value per ha outweighs the loss of value of other ecosystem services, which is often not the case in (sub)tropical forests. The results of this study contribute to a more complete picture of the human appropriation of water, thus feeding the debate on water for food or feed versus energy and wood.", "(Multi)wavelets increase both accuracy and efficiency of standard Godunov-type hydrodynamic models ": "This paper presents a scaled reformulation of a robust second-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) solver for the Shallow Water Equations (SWE), with guiding principles on how it can be naturally extended to fit into the multiresolution analysis of multiwavelets (MW). Multiresolution analysis applied to the flow and topography data enables the creation of an adaptive MWDG2 solution on a non-uniform grid. The multiresolution analysis also permits control of the adaptive model error by a single user-prescribed parameter. This results in an adaptive MWDG2 solver that can fully exploit the local (de)compression of piecewise-linear modelled data, and from which a first-order finite volume version (FV1) is directly obtainable based on the Haar wavelet (HFV1) for local (de)compression of piecewise-constant modelled data. The behaviour of the adaptive HFV1 and MWDG2 solvers is systematically studied on a number of well-known hydraulic tests that cover all elementary aspects relevant to accurate, efficient and robust modelling. The adaptive solvers are run starting from a baseline mesh with a single element, and their accuracy and efficiency are measured referring to standard FV1 and DG2 simulations on the uniform grid involving the finest resolution accessible by the adaptive solvers. Our findings reveal that the MWDG2 solver can achieve the same accuracy as the DG2 solver but with a greater efficiency than the FV1 solver due to the smoothness of its piecewise-linear basis, which enables more aggressive coarsening than with the piecewise-constant basis in the HFV1 solver. This suggests a great potential for the MWDG2 solver to efficiently handle the depth and breadth in resolution variability, while also being a multiresolution mesh generator. Accompanying model software and simulation data are openly available online.", "The impact of porous media heterogeneity on non-Darcy flow behaviour from pore-scale simulation ": "The effect of pore-scale heterogeneity on non-Darcy flow behaviour is investigated by means of direct flow simulations on 3-D images of a beadpack, Bentheimer sandstone and Estaillades carbonate. The critical Reynolds number indicating the cessation of the creeping Darcy flow regime in Estaillades carbonate is two orders of magnitude smaller than in Bentheimer sandstone, and is three orders of magnitude smaller than in the beadpack. It is inferred from the examination of flow field features that the emergence of steady eddies in pore space of Estaillades at elevated fluid velocities accounts for the early transition away from the Darcy flow regime. The non-Darcy coefficient \u03b2, the onset of non-Darcy flow, and the Darcy permeability for all samples are obtained and compared to available experimental data demonstrating the predictive capability of our approach. X-ray imaging along with direct pore-scale simulation of flow provides a viable alternative to experiments and empirical correlations for predicting non-Darcy flow parameters such as the \u03b2 factor, and the onset of non-Darcy flow.", "Flow and bed morphology response to the introduction of wood logs for sediment management ": "Submerged vanes alter sediment transport by inducing a secondary circulation without significantly compromising the conveyance capacity of the river. Here, a laboratory study is conducted to investigate whether wood logs or trunks can be used for sediment management. The effectivity of a traditional vane field is compared to set-ups with screens of stacked logs, and large individual trunks. Results indicate that all three set-ups redistribute sediment but that the trunks are least effective in inducing a secondary circulation and cause higher turbulence and drag, leading to a stronger decrease in streamwise velocity. We conclude that a field of trunks acts as a sediment trap because of a strong reduction of the streamwise velocity, without a strong secondary flow such as dominant in the other configurations. Screens of stacked logs can be successfully implemented in rivers, as they are only slightly less effective than traditional vanes. The risk of piping underneath objects and the associated scour are points of concern.", "Relational analysis of the resource nexus in arid land crop production ": "While a large number of descriptive studies have delineated the interlinkages between water, food and energy resources in the last decade, there is still need for systematic conceptualization of resource nexus interconnections. This paper proposes a theory of relational analysis of the nexus based on the analytical concept of nexus networks. A taxonomy of nexus interconnections, detailing sequential and hierarchical connections, is characterized between and amongst the technosphere and biosphere. We illustrate the use of a novel diagnostic tool with regard to its ability to integrate macro-, meso- and microscale drivers of nexus problems. We apply this framework to problems generated by intensive crop production for exportation in an arid landscape (driven by external markets) and sustainable management of water resources (driven by public policies) in a southern Spanish region. We elucidate interconnected causal mechanisms for groundwater overexploitation and profile different social-ecological patterns on a spatially-explicit basis. The proposed approach is capable of accounting for the water-energy-food resource nexus in an integrated and multi-level fashion, addressing the tensions generated by both multi-functionality and resource entanglement in complex social-ecological systems.", "Understanding and managing the food-energy-water nexus \u2013 opportunities for water resources research ": "Studies on the food, energy, and water (FEW) nexus lay a shared foundation for researchers, policy makers, practitioners, and stakeholders to understand and manage linked production, utilization, and security of FEW systems. The FEW nexus paradigm provides the water community specific channels to move forward in interdisciplinary research where integrated water resources management (IWRM) has fallen short. Here, we help water researchers identify, articulate, utilize, and extend our disciplinary strengths within the broader FEW communities, while informing scientists in the food and energy domains about our unique skillset. This paper explores the relevance of existing and ongoing scholarship within the water community, as well as current research needs, for understanding FEW processes and systems and implementing FEW solutions through innovations in technologies, infrastructures, and policies. Following the historical efforts in IWRM, hydrologists, water resources engineers, economists, and policy analysts are provided opportunities for interdisciplinary studies among themselves and in collaboration with energy and food communities, united by a common path to achieve sustainability development goals.", "Seawater intrusion processes, investigation and management: Recent advances and future challenges ": "Seawater intrusion (SI) is a global issue, exacerbated by increasing demands for freshwater in coastal zones and predisposed to the influences of rising sea levels and changing climates. This review presents the state of knowledge in SI research, compares classes of methods for assessing and managing SI, and suggests areas for future research. We subdivide SI research into categories relating to processes, measurement, prediction and management. Considerable research effort spanning more than 50years has provided an extensive array of field, laboratory and computer-based techniques for SI investigation. Despite this, knowledge gaps exist in SI process understanding, in particular associated with transient SI processes and timeframes, and the characterization and prediction of freshwater\u2013saltwater interfaces over regional scales and in highly heterogeneous and dynamic settings. Multidisciplinary research is warranted to evaluate interactions between SI and submarine groundwater discharge, ecosystem health and unsaturated zone processes. Recent advances in numerical simulation, calibration and optimization techniques require rigorous field-scale application to contemporary issues of climate change, sea-level rise, and socioeconomic and ecological factors that are inseparable elements of SI management. The number of well-characterized examples of SI is small, and this has impeded understanding of field-scale processes, such as those controlling mixing zones, saltwater upconing, heterogeneity effects and other factors. Current SI process understanding is based mainly on numerical simulation and laboratory sand-tank experimentation to unravel the combined effects of tides, surface water\u2013groundwater interaction, heterogeneity, pumping and density contrasts. The research effort would benefit from intensive measurement campaigns to delineate accurately interfaces and their movement in response to real-world coastal aquifer stresses, encompassing a range of geological and hydrological settings.", "An argument-driven classification and comparison of reservoir operation optimization methods ": "Reservoir operation optimization aims to determine release and transfer decisions that maximise water management objectives such as ensuring a reliable water supply, hydropower production, mitigation of downstream floods, etc. An extensive and growing body of scientific literature exists on advancing and applying mathematical optimization methods to reservoir operation problems. In this paper, we review such literature according to a novel classification system of optimization approaches, which focuses on the characteristics of the actual operation problem \u2013 i.e. what needs to be optimized, or in mathematical terms, \u2018the argument\u2019 of the optimization problems - rather than the mathematical properties of the optimization algorithm. This enables us to discuss the advantages, limitations and the scope of application of the different optimisation methods; and to provide practical guidelines for matching the properties of a system and operation problem with a suitable optimization method. Alongside this paper we provide code to implement many of the methods we review for an illustrative reservoir system.", "Real-time simulation of surface water and groundwater with data assimilation ": "Data assimilation (DA) has proven to be a useful technique in real-time hydrological modeling and forecasting. Jointly assimilating both surface water and groundwater data has promising application value for hydrological simulations in areas where surface water and groundwater are closely linked; however, such studies have not been intensively reported. In addition, the role of the quality of precipitation forecast has not been fully addressed in real-time forecasting using a coupled surface water - groundwater model, where the model evaluation includes both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. In the present study, we use the MIKE SHE hydrological model code in conjunction with the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter DA technique. The study area is a small urbanized catchment in Denmark. The model is run in simulated real-time using historical numerical weather prediction forecasts. The results show that DA can significantly reduce model bias and thereby improve model performance for both surface water and groundwater simulations. Comparing the impact of DA and rainfall forecast quality, it is found that, for streamflow forecasts, the most important factor is the quality of the rainfall data; whereas for groundwater head forecasts, the initial state at time of forecast is more important. We also find that inclusion of rainfall forecast uncertainty may be important for simulating a single event, however, it is not vital if long-term average model performance is of interest.", "Analysis of the current world biofuel production under a water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus perspective ": "This paper assesses the sustainability of bioenergy production under a nexus perspective through a new efficiency type index. The index describes 1st generation biofuel production under the perspective of the implied consumption of natural resources. We consider the sustainability of energy production as a sequence of steps, each characterised by its efficiency, and propose an index which returns an overall efficiency value describing the adequacy or inadequacy of the considered processes under a nexus perspective. The direct application of the nexus index entails an indication of the possible improvements needed to move production towards most sustainable processes or places. Moreover, it allows evaluating the efficiency of the main crops currently used in biofuel production with respect to the water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus. The results depict countries presently capable of performing sustainable production of 1st generation biofuel from particular crops. Furthermore, the analysis of the single components of the nexus index allows understanding the effects of possible improvements (e.g. soil and water management, new generation biofuels) on the overall production efficiency under a nexus perspective.", "Capillary pressure\u2013saturation relationships for porous granular materials: Pore morphology method vs. pore unit assembly method ": "In studies of two-phase flow in complex porous media it is often desirable to have an estimation of the capillary pressure\u2013saturation curve prior to measurements. Therefore, we compare in this research the capability of three pore-scale approaches in reproducing experimentally measured capillary pressure\u2013saturation curves. To do so, we have generated 12 packings of spheres that are representative of four different glass-bead packings and eight different sand packings, for which we have found experimental data on the capillary pressure\u2013saturation curve in the literature. In generating the packings, we matched the particle size distributions and porosity values of the granular materials. We have used three different pore-scale approaches for generating the capillary pressure\u2013saturation curves of each packing: i) the Pore Unit Assembly (PUA) method in combination with the Mayer and Stowe\u2013Princen (MS\u2013P) approximation for estimating the entry pressures of pore throats, ii) the PUA method in combination with the hemisphere approximation, and iii) the Pore Morphology Method (PMM) in combination with the hemisphere approximation. The three approaches were also used to produce capillary pressure\u2013saturation curves for the coating layer of paper, used in inkjet printing. Curves for such layers are extremely difficult to determine experimentally, due to their very small thickness and the presence of extremely small pores (less than one micrometer in size). Results indicate that the PMM and PUA-hemisphere method give similar capillary pressure\u2013saturation curves, because both methods rely on a hemisphere to represent the air\u2013water interface. The ability of the hemisphere approximation and the MS\u2013P approximation to reproduce correct capillary pressure seems to depend on the type of particle size distribution, with the hemisphere approximation working well for narrowly distributed granular materials.", "Pore-scale contact angle measurements at reservoir conditions using X-ray microtomography ": "Contact angle is a principal control of the flow of multiple fluid phases through porous media; however its measurement on other than flat surfaces remains a challenge. A new method is presented for the measurement of the contact angle between immiscible fluids at the pore scale at reservoir conditions (10MPa and 50\u00b0C) inside a quarry limestone through the use of X-ray microtomography. It is applied to a super-critical CO2\u2013brine\u2013carbonate system by resampling the micro-CT data onto planes orthogonal to the contact lines, allowing for vectors to be traced along the grain surface and the CO2\u2013brine interface. A distribution of contact angles ranging from 35\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 is observed, indicating that the CO2\u2013brine\u2013carbonate system is weakly water-wet. This range of contact angles can be understood as the result of contact angle hysteresis and surface heterogeneity on a range of length scales. Surface heterogeneity is examined by comparison of micro-CT results with optical thin sections and SEM images.", "Understanding, management and modelling of urban hydrology and its consequences for receiving waters: A state of the art ": "Urban hydrology has evolved to improve the way urban runoff is managed for flood protection, public health and environmental protection. There have been significant recent advances in the measurement and prediction of urban rainfall, with technologies such as radar and microwave networks showing promise. The ability to predict urban hydrology has also evolved, to deliver models suited to the small temporal and spatial scales typical of urban and peri-urban applications. Urban stormwater management increasingly consider the needs of receiving environments as well as those of humans. There is a clear trend towards approaches that attempt to restore pre-development flow-regimes and water quality, with an increasing recognition that restoring a more natural water balance benefits not only the environment, but enhances the liveability of the urban landscape. Once regarded only as a nuisance, stormwater is now increasingly regarded as a resource. Despite the advances, many important challenges in urban hydrology remain. Further research into the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban rainfall is required to improve short-term rainfall prediction. The performance of stormwater technologies in restoring the water balance and in removing emerging priority pollutants remain poorly quantified. All of these challenges are overlaid by the uncertainty of climate change, which imposes a requirement to ensure that stormwater management systems are adaptable and resilient to changes. Urban hydrology will play a critical role in addressing these challenges.", "A global-scale two-layer transient groundwater model: Development and application to groundwater depletion ": "Groundwater is the world\u2019s largest accessible source of freshwater to satisfy human water needs. Moreover, groundwater buffers variable precipitation rates over time, thereby effectively sustaining river flows in times of droughts and evaporation in areas with shallow water tables. In this study, building on previous work, we simulate groundwater head fluctuations and groundwater storage changes in both confined and unconfined aquifer systems using a global-scale high-resolution (5\u2032) groundwater model by deriving new estimates of the distribution and thickness of confining layers. Inclusion of confined aquifer systems (estimated 6\u201320% of the total aquifer area) improves estimates of timing and amplitude of groundwater head fluctuations and changes groundwater flow paths and groundwater-surface water interaction rates. Groundwater flow paths within confining layers are shorter than paths in the underlying aquifer, while flows within the confined aquifer can get disconnected from the local drainage system due to the low conductivity of the confining layer. Lateral groundwater flows between basins are significant in the model, especially for areas with (partially) confined aquifers were long flow paths crossing catchment boundaries are simulated, thereby supporting water budgets of neighboring catchments or aquifer systems. The developed two-layer transient groundwater model is used to identify hot-spots of groundwater depletion. Global groundwater depletion is estimated as 7013\u00a0 km3 (137\u00a0 km3y\n                        \n                           \n                           \n                              \u2212\n                              1\n                           \n                        \n                     ) over 1960\u20132010, which is consistent with estimates of previous studies.", "Stationarity is undead: Uncertainty dominates the distribution of extremes ": "The increasing effort to develop and apply nonstationary models in hydrologic frequency analyses under changing environmental conditions can be frustrated when the additional uncertainty related to the model complexity is accounted for along with the sampling uncertainty. In order to show the practical implications and possible problems of using nonstationary models and provide critical guidelines, in this study we review the main tools developed in this field (such as nonstationary distribution functions, return periods, and risk of failure) highlighting advantages and disadvantages. The discussion is supported by three case studies that revise three illustrative examples reported in the scientific and technical literature referring to the Little Sugar Creek (at Charlotte, North Carolina), Red River of the North (North Dakota/Minnesota), and the Assunpink Creek (at Trenton, New Jersey). The uncertainty of the results is assessed by complementing point estimates with confidence intervals (CIs) and emphasizing critical aspects such as the subjectivity affecting the choice of the models\u2019 structure. Our results show that (1) nonstationary frequency analyses should not only be based on at-site time series but require additional information and detailed exploratory data analyses (EDA); (2) as nonstationary models imply that the time-varying model structure holds true for the entire future design life period, an appropriate modeling strategy requires that EDA identifies a well-defined deterministic mechanism leading the examined process; (3) when the model structure cannot be inferred in a deductive manner and nonstationary models are fitted by inductive inference, model structure introduces an additional source of uncertainty so that the resulting nonstationary models can provide no practical enhancement of the credibility and accuracy of the predicted extreme quantiles, whereas possible model misspecification can easily lead to physically inconsistent results; (4) when the model structure is uncertain, stationary models and a suitable assessment of the uncertainty accounting for possible temporal persistence should be retained as more theoretically coherent and reliable options for practical applications in real-world design and management problems; (5) a clear understanding of the actual probabilistic meaning of stationary and nonstationary return periods and risk of failure is required for a correct risk assessment and communication.", "A generalized framework for process-informed nonstationary extreme value analysis ": "Evolving climate conditions and anthropogenic factors, such as CO2 emissions, urbanization and population growth, can cause changes in weather and climate extremes. Most current risk assessment models rely on the assumption of stationarity (i.e., no temporal change in statistics of extremes). Most nonstationary modeling studies focus primarily on changes in extremes over time. Here, we present Process-informed Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis (ProNEVA) as a generalized tool for incorporating different types of physical drivers (i.e., underlying processes), stationary and nonstationary concepts, and extreme value analysis methods (i.e., annual maxima, peak-over-threshold). ProNEVA builds upon a newly-developed hybrid evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for numerical parameters estimation and uncertainty assessment. This offers more robust uncertainty estimates of return periods of climatic extremes under both stationary and nonstationary assumptions. ProNEVA is designed as a generalized tool allowing using different types of data and nonstationarity concepts physically-based or purely statistical) into account. In this paper, we show a wide range of applications describing changes in: annual maxima river discharge in response to urbanization, annual maxima sea levels over time, annual maxima temperatures in response to CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, and precipitation with a peak-over-threshold approach. ProNEVA is freely available to the public and includes a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance its implementation.", "Multiscale modelling of dual-porosity porous media; a computational pore-scale study for flow and solute transport ": "Many environmental and agricultural applications involve the transport of water and dissolved constituents through aggregated soil profiles, or porous media that are structured, fractured or macroporous in other ways. During the past several decades, various process-based macroscopic models have been used to simulate contaminant transport in such media. Many of these models consider advective-dispersive transport through relatively large inter-aggregate pore domains, while exchange with the smaller intra-aggregate pores is assumed to be controlled by diffusion. Exchange of solute between the two domains is often represented using a first-order mass transfer coefficient, which is commonly obtained by fitting to observed data. This study aims to understand and quantify the solute exchange term by applying a dual-porosity pore-scale network model to relatively large domains, and analysing the pore-scale results in terms of the classical dual-porosity (mobile-immobile) transport formulation.\n                  We examined the effects of key parameters (notably aggregate porosity and aggregate permeability) on the main dual-porosity model parameters, i.e., the mobile water fraction (\u03d5m\n                     ) and the mass transfer coefficient (\u03b1). Results were obtained for a wide range of aggregate porosities (between 0.082 and 0.700). The effect of aggregate permeability was explored by varying pore throat sizes within the aggregates. Solute breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained with the pore-scale network model at several locations along the domain were analysed using analytical solutions of the dual-porosity model to obtain estimates of \u03d5m\n                      and \u03b1. An increase in aggregate porosity was found to decrease \u03d5m\n                      and increase \u03b1, leading to considerable tailing in the BTCs. Changes in the aggregate pore throat size affected the relative flow velocity between the intra- and inter-aggregate domains. Higher flow velocities within the aggregates caused a change in the transport regime from diffusion dominated to more advection dominated. This change increased the exchange rate of solutes between the mobile and immobile domains, with a related increase in the value of the mass transfer coefficient and less tailing in the BTCs.", "\n               In situ characterization of immiscible three-phase flow at the pore scale for a water-wet carbonate rock ": "X-ray micro-tomography is used to image the pore-scale configurations of fluid in a rock saturated with three phases - brine, oil and gas - mimicking a subsurface reservoir, at high pressure and temperature. We determine pore occupancy during a displacement sequence that involves waterflooding, gas injection and water re-injection. In the water-wet sample considered, brine occupied the smallest pores, gas the biggest, while oil occupied pores of intermediate size and is displaced by both water and gas. Double displacement events have been observed, where gas displaces oil that displaces water or vice versa. The thickness of water and oil layers have been quantified, as have the contact angles between gas and oil, and oil and water. These results are used to explain the nature of trapping in three-phase flow, specifically how oil preferentially traps gas in the presence of water.", "Sustainable development in cities: Studying the relationship between groundwater level and urbanization using remote sensing data ": "Sustainable urban development has been one of the main concerns for policy-makers and increasing rate of population and urbanization have resulted in several socio-environmental impacts on people. Hence, water resources management in cities, as one of the most vital strategies, has become more complicated and challenging. In this study, the impact of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater level fluctuations was assessed. Using remote sensing data from different satellites and missions, data of water storage mass, precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, land cover etc. was extracted and processed by employing different programming languages and mapping tools. Atlanta metro area in Georgia, USA was selected as the case study location and the potential impacts of urban development in this city on groundwater resources were studied. The results suggest that from 2001 to 2013, limited urban development has happened in Atlanta; while this urbanization rate was more intense during previous decades and is predicted to be increased by 2050. Therefore, although other land cover types may be more correlated, results of correlating groundwater level with urban land cover is inconclusive for Atlanta metro area. Nonetheless, since relationship between urbanization and GW level variations is undeniable, novel methodology of this study can be employed for other fast-growing cities, especially in China and India.", "Occurrence and fate of emerging contaminants in water environment: A review ": "Emerging contaminants (ECs), such as personal care products (PCPs), endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), pharmaceuticals (PhACs) and their transformation products,whose occurrence at trace levels in treated wastewater is of concern for human health and the aquatic ecosystem. Due to the relatively new introduction or detection of these pollutants, there exists a gap in the knowledge on their fate, behaviors and effects, as well as on treatment technologies for their efficient removal. Furthermore, despite the advances in treatment technologies, the design of existing treatment plants are not suited to remove these ECs, in addition to there being a lack of published health standards that provide guideline in treating these pollutants. Many new ECs are being introduced into the environment without detection. In these context, this paper reviews existing research that provide reliable and quantitative information on pharmaceuticals, PCPs and EDCs and their concentrations in surface water, ground water, drinking water and treated wastewater and the removal efficiency of different treatment processes for different emerging pollutants, with a focus on recent studies regarding the fate and behavior of the contaminants in wastewater treatment plants and in the environment as well. The paper also highlights various biological and chemical treatment techniques and their drawbacks. Also, this review discusses the scope of future research on ECs.", "Assessment of groundwater quality and remediation in karst aquifers: A review ": "Karst aquifers, capable of storing and transmitting large amount of water, are the main source of drinking water in many regions worldwide. Their excessive permeability leads to an enhanced vulnerability to retain and spread the contamination accordingly. From sustainability perspective, the environmental, economic and social impacts of karst contamination on water resources management are gaining more attention. In this study, an overview of hydrogeological processes and concepts regarding groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karstic systems is presented, followed by a short discussion on surface water and groundwater interaction. Due to the complexity of karstic systems, different approaches have been developed by researchers for investigating and understanding hydrogeological processes and groundwater behavior in karst which are reviewed herein. Additionally, groundwater contamination issues and the most common and effective remediation techniques in karstic terrains are discussed. Lastly, modeling techniques and remote sensing methods, as beneficial and powerful tools for assessing groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karst terrains, are reviewed and evaluated. In each section, relevant research works conducted for Puerto Rico are discussed and some recommendations are presented to complement the ongoing hydrogeological investigations on this island.", "Geospatial and multivariate analysis of trace metals in tubewell water using for drinking purpose in the upper Gangetic basin, India: Heavy metal pollution index ": "Groundwater samples via tubewells were collected from the district Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh (India). The study aimed to analyse groundwater quality and potential sources of trace metal contamination using the multivariate statistical tool, and the level of contamination by applying contamination index (Cd) and heavy metal pollution index (HPI). The groundwater was found to be enriched with Fe and contaminated with the trace and toxic elements like Al, As, B, Cu, Mn and Pb having mean values of 2786, 152, 9, 1033, 107, 199 and 15\u202f\u00b5L respectively. Arsenic exceeded the\u00a0WHO (2011) guidelines and BIS (2012) standard (10\u202f\u00b5g/L) for 30% of the groundwater samples. For B, 46% of the samples were found having concentration higher than BIS (2012) permissible limit (1000\u202f\u00b5g/L) and 3% to WHO (2011) guideline values (2400\u202f\u00b5L). Lead level exceeded the BIS (2012) standard value and WHO (2011) guideline value in 46% of the samples. Multivariate analysis identified three factors responsible for data composition explaining 81% of the total variance in groundwater samples. Factor analysis (PCA and CA) allowed grouping of parameters according to the common features; Fe, Mn and Pb were associated with PC1 and controlled by the mixed origin such as geogenic sources as well as anthropogenic activities. Boron and Cu (PC2) were controlled by anthropogenic activities while As (PC3) was derived from the geogenic sources. The northern part of study area has higher Pb and Mn concentration than the southern part associated with small industrial activities. Degree of contamination and heavy metal pollution index supported the results and higher contamination was found to be in the vicinity of industrial setups. The overall quality (estimated using HPI values) of groundwater in the northern area is poor, and may cause potential health risk from the analyzed tubewells to the local population if the water is consumed for longer time.", "Quality and health risk assessment of shallow groundwater aquifers within the Atankwidi basin of Ghana ": "This study has appraised groundwater suitability for drinking and irrigation, and its potential health risk to humans within the Atankwidi basin of Ghana. Twenty-six boreholes were sampled and their physicochemical and heavy metal constituents determined to evaluate the groundwater potability from water quality index computations. Chlorinity, salinity, permeability indices, sodium adsorption ratio, residual bicarbonate and magnesium hardness were also computed to assess the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation. More so, the hazard quotient, hazard index and cancer risk of analyzed heavy metals were estimated to assess their potential carcinogenic risk to human health. The results showed that four and nine samples had concentrations of As, Zn and Pb exceeding respective WHO recommended limits of 0.001\u202fmg/L, 0.006\u202fmg/L and 0.01\u202fmg/L. Fluoride levels in four samples exceeded the maximum WHO limit of 1.5\u202fmg/L whilst two samples were below the minimum limit of 0.5\u202fmg/L. Water quality indices revealed that about 80% of groundwaters were potable. Compared to adults, children were more than twice vulnerable to potential carcinogenic effects over a life-time through dermal and ingestion exposures. The groundwater was generally found to be suitable for irrigation, especially for moderate salt-tolerant crops such as maize, millet, sorghum, pepper, tomatoes, cabbage, etc. To minimize potential exposure to carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks, there should be awareness creation to stop the use of agro-chemicals for farming be avoided.", "Hydrogeochemical investigation of groundwater in Dhaka City of Bangladesh using GIS and multivariate statistical techniques ": "GIS and multivariate statistics along with the geochemical approaches were applied in this study to investigate the hydrogeochemical behavior, source apportionment of groundwater pollutants and their spatial distribution in the aquifer system of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. A total of 33 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed, in order to evaluate the geochemical constituents of groundwater. Results found that, the trends of cations and anions are Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3\n                     \u2212 > Cl\u2212 > SO4\n                     2\u2212 > NO3\n                     \u2212 respectively, and Ca2+\u2013Mg2+\u2013HCO3\n                     \u2212 is the dominant groundwater type. Except Na+, K+, Cl\u2212, F\u2212 and NO3\n                     \u2212 all others measured parameters fall within the permissible limits. However, silicate weathering was identified as the major processes of controlling the groundwater solute content. Besides, cation exchange plays a significant role, influencing the water chemistry of the aquifers. Aqueous speciation model revealed that, aquifer materials were more saturated with aragonite, calcite and dolomite, and under-saturated with halite. From regression and correlation analysis it was found that, EC, Cl\u2212 and SO4\n                     2\u2212 were correlated with each other's; which might helpful for site specific monitoring of groundwater quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were also employed to appraise the sources of contaminants, and it was explored that both natural and anthropogenic factors were influencing the groundwater quality. Groundwater was contaminated due to induced river recharge and rapid infiltration of contaminated water through the recharge areas. In this situation it is expected that, outcomes of this study will provide useful insights to planners for sustainable management of groundwater resources of this megacity.", "Potential heavy metal pollution of soil and water resources from artisanal mining in Kokoteasua, Ghana ": "Effluents and mine waste from artisanal mining in Kokoteasua, a community in Ghana, are discharged directly to the environment without prior treatment and have the potential of polluting the soil and water resources that the populace rely on for their daily water need. Therefore, this study has assessed the impact of the artisanal mining activities on the soil and water resources in the community. The method employed involved mapping the water supply points in the community and sampling the water supply points and the soil (at 20 cm and 40 cm depths) to determine their heavy metal levels (i.e. Fe, Pb, Zn, As, Mn, Cu, and Hg). The water quality was assessed using the World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline values for drinking water while pollution indices were used to evaluate the levels of soil pollution. The results, generally, indicated that groundwater in the community is potable but unsuitable for drinking in isolated locations due to high levels of As and Zn. The stream, however, recorded high levels of Mn, Fe, and pH above the acceptable WHO drinking water guidelines. Again, the study found the soil to be extremely polluted with all the measured heavy metals (except Hg) from contamination factor, enrichment factor, geo-accumulation index and pollution load index assessments. Thus, the artisanal mining needs to be regulated to protect the water resource and soil from further pollution.", "Impact of Municipal Solid Waste Landfill leachate on groundwater quality in Varanasi, India. ": "This study assesses the impact of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill leachate on its surrounding groundwater quality of village Ramna, Varanasi, India. Leachate pollution index (LPI) of landfill leachate was evaluated with their physicochemical analysis that represents the overall leachate pollution potential and hazardous nature of MSW leachate. Physicochemical analysis of groundwater quality around the landfill site does not favour to drinking and domestic purposes as per the WHO and BIS standard. A considerable amount of NO3\n                     \u2212, PO4\n                     3\u2212, Fe, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS) were found in the groundwater samples near to the landfill site especially during post-monsoon, indicating that groundwater quality is being significantly affected by leachate percolation. Factor analysis signifies positive loading of most of the toxic pollutant that presenting MSW leachate impact on groundwater quality. WQI results also revealed that most of the groundwater samples were deteriorated from good and excellent water quality in pre-monsoon to fair water quality in post monsoon near the landfill site. Groundwater flow modeling simulation also showing that increase in the hydraulic head during the post-monsoon responsible for the downward flow of leachate pollutants from the landfill site. This Study suggests an urgent need for the sanitary landfill to control and minimize the impact of MSW leachate on groundwater quality around the Raman MSW landfill site.", "Assessment of geothermal water quality for industrial and irrigation purposes in the Unai geothermal field, Gujarat, India ": "Nowadays, a spotlight on the direct manipulation of water from the geothermal fields is laid for manifold applications. This manuscript discusses the utilization of water produced from geothermal wells for irrigation and industrial purposes. In order to identify the suitability of the water for the above mentioned uses, various hydrochemical parameters were evaluated. Samples were collected from three geothermal well sites from Unai village, a prominent geothermal field situated in Navsari district, Gujarat, India. The hydrochemistry of the samples collected from hot spring (depth 30\u201345\u202fm) was studied and samples were examined by calculating different parameters. The complete study was done individually for both industrial and irrigational uses of geothermal water. The mean surface temperature of the water is 55\u202f\u00b0C and average pH of the sample studied is 8.12. The key Water Quality Indices (WQI) such as Langelier Saturation Index (LSI), Ryznar Stability Index (RSI), Puckorius Scaling Index (PSI) and Larson-Skold Index (LS) were examined for industrial utilization and the key indices like Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR), Sodium Percentage (SP), Kelly Ratio (KR) Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) and Permeability Index (PI) were examined for irrigational utilization of geothermal water. LSI and RSI values show that carbonate and bicarbonate concentration is in the desirable range, however, LS (15.09, 13.54) is very high which indicates higher Cl- content. High value of indices such as SAR, KR, and SP points out the increased concentration of Na+ in the water sample. The results of this study would help the end users to identify the necessary water-treatments before utilizing the water for industrial and irrigation purposes in the study area.", "Ion exchanges process for calcium, magnesium and total hardness from ground water with natural zeolite ": "Presence of hardness ions in the municipal drinking water is the major health concern. So to minimize the hardness of drinking water up to the environmental protection authority (EPA) quality standard expensive treatments are available. This directly affects the rural and low community society. The aim of this research work is to remove the calcium, magnesium and total hardness from the municipal drinking water supply with natural zeolite. All the experiments on the research work were carried out in batch method. The experimental result illustrates that at 2M NaCl and 60\u202f\u00b0C activation temperature is suitable to achieved maximum 80.2% calcium, 84.8% magnesium and 81.0% total hardness at optimum condition pH 6.9, dose 50\u202fg/L, particle size 1\u202fmm, treatment time 30\u202fmin and experimental temperature 25\u202f\u00b0C. Regeneration of zeolite at 3M NaCl and 90\u202f\u00b0C is appropriate to achieve 80.0% total hardness, 79.9% Ca ions, 85.6% Mg ion at pH 6.9, size 1\u202fmm and regeneration time 15\u202fmin. The X-ray diffraction, scanning electron micrograph and Fourier infrared transfer analysis confirms that zeolite has participated on hardness removal. Overall zeolite is highly efficient for hardness removal and can be employed in the drinking water treatment plant.", "Modeling groundwater level fluctuations in Tehran aquifer: Results from a 3D unconfined aquifer model ": "Heavy groundwater withdrawal results in aquifer compaction and increases the risk of land subsidence hazard with significant economic, environmental, and social consequences. Having an accurate model for hydraulic pressure loss and groundwater level changes is one of the crucial factors in proper modeling and evaluation of land subsidence hazard. This paper investigates dynamics of groundwater variations in Tehran aquifer. By analyzing a comprehensive geological and hydrological data such as alluvium depths, hydraulic conductivity, piezometric measurements, and pumping well information, we model the hydraulic heads and evaluate the hydraulic conductivity. For validation of the model, groundwater level changes resulting from the model are compared with piezometric measurements for the period 2006\u20132011. The comparison shows a good consistency between the predicted and observed hydraulic head values with the maximum absolute error of less than 7\u202fm and RMS error of about 5\u202fm, that is about 2% error, considering that the hydraulic head values are between 850 and 1250\u202fm. This shows the capability and accuracy of the proposed model to simulate and predict the aquifer hydraulic head distribution and its changes. The model also indicates high hydraulic conductivity in the northern and central parts of Tehran Plain, which is attributed to the river sedimentation there.", "Environmental risk assessment of coal fly ash on soil and groundwater quality, Aligarh, India ": "An open and indiscriminate disposal of coal fly ash causes extensive changes in physicochemical properties of soil and water. Few studies propose that coal fly ash is a potential soil ameliorant that may improve the physical, chemical, biological properties, and nutritional quality of the agricultural soil. However, several recent studies documented that incorporation of higher dosages of coal fly ash into water and soil releases toxic elements consequently creating soil and groundwater pollution leading to major health, environmental, and land use problems. To assess the environmental impact of hazardous coal fly ash on the ecological system, physicochemical and hydrogeochemical analysis of both soil and groundwater are performed. X-ray diffractograms (XRD) of soils from agricultural and landfill sites (n = 8) along with coal fly ash (n = 2) show the presence of characteristic minerals of coal fly ash and also toxic arsenic mineral phases suggesting the strong influence of hazardous coal fly ash on agricultural soil. The hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater samples (n = 27) are analyzed which show elevated concentrations of most of the major ions corresponding to higher values than maximum permissible levels of recommended drinking water standards by World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The water quality indices (WQI) suggests poor to unsuitable water for drinking. Conversely, evaluation of various other hydrochemical indices calculated using elemental concentration of the groundwater samples demarcates contamination of water due to the open dumping of coal fly ash and therefore not desirable for drinking purposes.", "Synthesis of bone char from cattle bones and its application for fluoride removal from the contaminated water ": "This study is focused on the synthesis of bone char (BC) and its application in adsorptive removal of fluoride from the water. The BC was synthesized by the thermal pyrolysis of used cattle bones. In preliminary stage, BC was synthesized at different temperatures ranging from 350 to 700\u202f\u00b0C and due to the higher surface area and adsorption capacity, BC synthesized at 350\u202f\u00b0C was selected for further experiments. The XRD pattern of BC found better in agreement with the standard pattern of hydroxyapatite. FTIR analysis also signified basic spectra of hydroxyapatite with specific bands at wavelength of 3429, 1639, 1453, 1037, 604 and 566\u202fcm\u22121. Typical agglomerated structure of hydroxyapatite was witnessed in morphological examination with SEM. The specific surface area, total pore volume and the average pore diameter were found 79.34\u202fm2 g\u22121, 0.041\u202fcm3 g\u22121 and 2.09\u202fnm, respectively. The elemental chemical analysis revealed 1.71 Ca/P ratio. About 10.56\u202fmg of fluoride was adsorbed on 1\u202fg of BC. The adsorption isotherm data was briefly illustrated by applying Langmuir isotherm model and Freundlich isotherm model. In conclusion, BC is successfully synthesized and the highest fluoride adsorption capacity was achieved as compared with earlier studies.", "Groundwater governance in Bangladesh: Established practices and recent trends ": "Legal framework is very crucial to protect the vital resources, to provide rights to public and administration, to support national policy and to bring technological intervention to ensure equitable distribution, fair management, and effective decision making. In Bangladesh, groundwater is not directly priced (other than pumping costs), perhaps such issue is not surprising that users do not meter the volumes of water usage. Beside the industry, agricultural sector is by far the biggest groundwater consumer of this country, contributing significant amount of annual meter drop in the groundwater table to the annual decline of groundwater table. Additionally, the groundwater resources are severely affected by, pollution, encroachment and overexploitation. National Water Policy (1999) and Bangladesh Water Act (2013) are considered as country's pivotal legal framework but both of these lag behind to provide effective guidelines on permission, extraction limit, monitoring, protection of quality, water harvesting procedure, and recharge mechanism. Existing institutions suffer from consistent crisis, politics, corruption, absence of public participation and coordination of other institutions, mismanagement, and empirical assessment. This study evaluates the existing water related policies and functions of multidimensional institutions, and discusses the key challenges of effective groundwater management. The present paper also provides an overview of established practices around the world to cope with the common challenges.", "Groundwater potentiality study in drought prone barind tract, NW Bangladesh using remote sensing and GIS ": "Present study is carried out in the drought prone Barind tract in the north-western part of Bangladesh to identify zones of groundwater potentiality using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) based geospatial multi-criteria approach. Decreasing rainfall trend along with increasing demand for groundwater irrigation of this agro-based area utters urgent need for sustainable groundwater resource development. The study area possesses sub-dendritic drainage pattern with highly irregular to irregular geomorphological character with mostly flat to gentle slope represents 'not so good category' for groundwater development because of lower rainfall with less favorable infiltration capacity of top soil with respect to time of percolation of runoff. Here major portion of runoff water loses and not allows more infiltration to recharge the groundwater and, therefore is less potential for groundwater occurrence and development. To delineate groundwater potentiality, thematic layers like geomorphology, drainage density, rainfall, lithology, lineament density, slope and land use/land cover (LULC) have taken into consideration to integrate in the GIS environment, and has categorized as: 4% (48\u202fkm2) - very good, 13% (170\u202fkm2) - good; 25% (342\u202fkm2) - moderate; 30% (405\u202fkm2) - poor; and 28% (365\u202fkm2) as very poor category. On the other hand, this potential zonation is most sensitive to lithology; followed by slope and lineament density; and succeeded by geomorphology, drainage density, rainfall, and LULC. This study helps not only to classify zones of groundwater resource potentiality, but also to assess groundwater resource potentiality and scopes for its future development at a glance and provides a guideline for the groundwater resource management approach particularly in the area.", "Comprehensive investigation of groundwater quality in the north-west of Iran: Physicochemical and heavy metal analysis ": "The suitability of rural groundwater quality for drinking purposes were investigated in the north west of Iran. Major anions, cations and heavy metals were measured in 39 water wells during the summer and spring seasons. The spatial distribution of major parameters and hydro-chemical faces were described by developing GIS-based maps and Piper and Gibbs diagrams. According to the results, the EC values were in the range of 461 and 2600\u202f\u03bcs/cm with the hardness contents between 220 and 720\u202fmg/L as CaCO3. It was found that, the total hardness is highly correlated with the magnesium concentration than calcium in all samples. The dominant cations and anions were in the order of Mg2+ > Na+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3\n                     - > SO4\n                     2- > Cl- > NO3\n                     - > F-, respectively. The major water types in the area were fresh (Ca-HCO3) and saline (Ca-Mg-Cl). Based on Gibbs plot, the main mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry were rainfall dominance, rock weathering dominance, and evaporation-participation dominance. The lower quality of water resources sited in the southern and northern parts of the area was observed according to the GIS maps. It was found that aluminum, boron, iron and manganese concentrations, in some cases, were higher than the guideline values however, it can be concluded that groundwater quality in the study area, apart from some cases, is suitable for drinking purposes without any specific treatment processes. The present study gives a comprehensive status of groundwater quality for proper management in the area.", "Potential for aquifer contamination of anthropogenic activity in the recharge area of the Guarani Aquifer System, southeast of Brazil ": "Understanding the response of physical environment to anthropogenic activities assists land use planning aimed at protecting water resources, which prevents society from incurring major economic and social costs. This paper aimed to identify the potential contamination of groundwater by human activity at an outcropping area of Guarani Aquifer System (GAS), the most important hydrogeological unit in South America. The methodology used was based on a multi-criteria analysis using decision matrices to analyze, from algebra mapping in a GIS environment, the influence of rock units, aquifer units, soil classes, steepness, slope shape, and land cover and use in contamination potential. Overall, medium to very high potential for groundwater contamination predominates in the area, amounting to 69.23%. In such areas, when the absence of federal or state law which defines the areas of protection for recharge, the master plans of the municipalities located in the GAS outcropping regions play an important role in complementing the legislation. S\u00e3o Carlos, has its own legislation that aims to control land use in areas of springs, and thereby to protect them. However, the GAS recharge areas near the surface are not contemplated, and specific regulation and standards for deployment of human activity in these areas, have not been established. Therefore, it is suggested that territorial planning to be carried out on a more refined scale. Given that the natural conditions and anthropogenic activities performed in the area of study are reflected in many other periurban wellheads, as well as that of the Guarani Aquifer outcropping are, the decision matrices designed can be applied and serve as an agile tool to define the recharge areas to be protected on a preliminary basis.", "Arsenic concentration in groundwater: Archetypal study from South Africa ": "South Africa does not have significant surface water resources, which is often easily affected by unpredictable and rapidly changing climatic variables, due to its location in the arid and semi-arid climatic setting. In large part of the country, groundwater from weathered and fractured crystalline rocks plays pivotal role in sustaining the livelihood, often it contains toxic metals released from the host rocks. The host rocks that are responsible for arsenic release in groundwater are primarily enriched due to metamorphism and igneous processes that resulted in the enrichment of economic minerals. Preliminary assessment indicates that the main arsenic containing minerals are arsenopyrite (FeAsS), arsenical oxide, sulpharsenide, arsenopyritical reefs, leucopyrite, l\u00f6llingite (FeAs2) and scorodite (FeAsO4\u00b72H2O). Owing to the release of arsenic from highly mineralized rocks that constitute the aquifers, arsenic concentration in the groundwater reaches up to 253\u202f\u03bcg/L (Namaqualand), 6150\u202f\u03bcg/L (west of Johannesburg), about 500\u202f\u03bcg/L in the Karoo aquifers, considerably higher than the WHO guideline value of 10\u202f\u03bcg/L. Acid mine drainage from coal and gold mining is also found to be an important source of arsenic and other toxic metals in groundwater.", "Groundwater quality and vulnerability assessment in west Luxor Governorate, Egypt ": "Groundwater is the main source of water for different purposes in the desert areas of Egypt. The agricultural and different human activities in line with hydrological characteristics have influenced the quality of this water resource. The main aim of this work was the determination of groundwater quality and vulnerability to pollution in west Luxor Governorate, Egypt. For completion of this work, 50 boreholes were sampled during October 2014 and groundwater samples were analyzed chemically. Hydrological, topographic, lithological, climatic conditions and land use data, which considered key factors for pollutants transport, were also collected for building groundwater vulnerability maps. The results revealed high levels of groundwater pollution with NO3\u00af, Cd and Pb, as well as increased levels of total dissolved solids. The map of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability (based on the IV index; Arauzo 2017) showed medium and high levels of vulnerability associated with natural factors in 62% and 38% of the area, respectively. The map of specific groundwater vulnerability (based on the LU-IV procedure; Arauzo 2017) indicated that 52% of the area showed high to extreme levels of vulnerability to nitrate pollution from nonpoint sources. From this, it was concluded that the study area can be considered as Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) and, therefore, specific measures (including optimization of water and N-fertilizers applications) must be taken in order to restore water quality.", "Assessment of groundwater quality for irrigation of green spaces in the Rourkela city of Odisha, India ": "For the health of the city dwellers the development of green spaces is imperative. Sustenance of such green spaces is directly controlled by the water quality. Steel City Rourkela in Odisha State of India, lying between 84.54\u00b0E longitude and 22.12\u00b0N latitude, has green spaces whose existence depends on the groundwater quality. The quality of 25 groundwater samples in the Rourkela city was evaluated for examining their suitability for irrigation purpose in order to sustain green spaces in the city. The assessment was completed using pH, Electrical Conductivity, Total Hardness, Sodium Absorption Ratio, Na %, Residual Soluble Carbonate, Residual Sodium Bicarbonate, Permeability index, Potential Salinity, Magnesium hazard, Magnesium/Calcium ratio, Kelley's ratio and indices of base exchange. Data plot dispositions on Gibb's diagram indicated that the chemistry of groundwater of the area is controlled by rock composition. Most of the samples with negative chloro-alkaline indices values suggested the predominance of chloro-alkaline disequilibrium process in the groundwater system. Data plot disposition on U.S. Salinity hazard diagram indicates that 11 and 14 samples belong to C2S1 and C1S1, illustrating medium salinity/low sodium type and low salinity/low sodium type, respectively. There was difference in the groundwater samples from Urban, Rurban and Rural setup of the region with respect to some parameters/indices. The spatial variability of the physico-chemical parameters suggests that the groundwater of Chhend colony, Civil Township, Sector 21, Uditnagar and Bandamunda are most suitable for irrigation, in contrast to that of Koel Nagar, Shaktinagar, Basanti Colony and northwest part of Jagda-Jhirpani area. With the surface water scarcity in the region the groundwater at some sites of the city can be used for maintenance of green spaces.", "Comparison among influencing factor, frequency ratio, and analytical hierarchy process techniques for groundwater potential zonation in Vaitarna basin, Maharashtra, India ": "Groundwater is a hidden natural resource which plays a crucial role in all the environmental and biological processes with a greater significance on socio-economic activities. However, the nature of groundwater is dynamic and highly variable from place to place. Therefore, for sustainable development and management, accurate location based groundwater potential mapping is critical in arid and semi-arid regions. This study demonstrates the proficiency of three decision making approaches, viz., influencing factors (IF), frequency ratio (FR), and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques in groundwater potentiality mapping. A total eight parameters such as lithology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density, land-use, lineament density, rainfall, soil texture, and soil depth are assessed through satellite and conventional data sources. Weights are assigned to all these parameters and their sub parameters to perform influencing factor and AHP models, based on existing knowledge. Frequency ratio is performed by calculation of the ratio between the number of wells availability on a category to the total area of each factor. Three resultant maps are prepared by integrating all these parameters and their corresponding weights in GIS environment. The validation results exhibit that the map produced using FR model is more efficient (75% accuracy) compared to the IF (71% accuracy) and AHP techniques (70% accuracy). Based on this study it is concluded that the frequency ratio model is more reliable for the assessment of groundwater potential. However, the groundwater potential maps prepared in this study will be helpful for effective planning and groundwater management in Vaitarna basin.", "Groundwater as a social-ecological system: A framework for managing groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States ": "Groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States is a critical source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities. Groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations, climate change and climate variability. Many groundwater systems in the region have been inappropriately managed, with increasing occurrences of groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion. This limits the availability of freshwater, increases the likelihood of contracting water borne diseases, and the cost of access to alternative freshwater sources. In this paper, we argue that groundwater systems are social-ecological systems, where anthropogenic activities and groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic, non-linear processes. We also argue that groundwater management failures in the region, are associated with traditional command and control approaches to management, which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and ecological groundwater systems; and assumes that groundwater resources, and the dependant human communities can be managed independently. Recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant social communities is important for the long-term sustainability of groundwater in these regions. Conceptual frameworks are useful tools to order phenomena and material, revealing patterns and processes, and enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single conceptual-empirical structure. We propose a framework to manage groundwater as a social-ecological system. The framework is comprised of three building blocks: complex adaptive systems, resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management. We discuss how the application of the framework in the Republic of Nauru may alter decades of groundwater mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path.", "Water as key to the sustainable development goals of South Sudan \u2013 A water quality assessment of Eastern Equatoria State ": "South Sudan, the world's newest nation is bestowed with huge fresh water resources. However, water resources management in South Sudan is lacking in water quality monitoring data and comprehensive plans of action for sustainable water resources development.\n                  Groundwater resources in particular have been exploited for domestic and irrigation use versus surface water. However, this groundwater withdrawal has not been monitored for its level and quality. To overcome this deficit, groundwater major ion chemistry in the South Sudan's Eastern Equatoria State was evaluated to determine its suitability for drinking, domestic, and irrigation purposes. A total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during wet (October 2014) and dry (April 2014) seasons. Sampling points were spread around the eight counties of Eastern Equatoria. Twenty two water samples were collected from each county. The samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters including alkalinity, calcium hardness, conductivity, pH, salinity, TDS, total hardness, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, CrT, Cd2+, Cu2+, FeT, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, NO3\n                     -, Cl-, F-, SO4\n                     2-, PO4\n                     3-, and SiO2. Groundwater irrigation quality indices including chlorinity index, Kelli Index, magnesium ratio, percentage of sodium must be replaced by sodium percentage (%Na), permeability index (PI), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), salinity index, sodicity index, and sodium absorption ratio (SAR), were calculated to determine the groundwater suitability for agricultural uses. The results were compared with South Sudan water quality guidelines (SSWQGs) and the WHO standards. Most of the water quality parameters met the WHO standards and SSWQGs prescribed for drinking and domestic purposes. The calculated irrigation water quality indices indicated the water suitability for irrigation.", "A Customized FuzzyAHP - GIS based DRASTIC-L model for intrinsic groundwater vulnerability assessment of urban and peri urban phreatic aquifer clusters ": "The groundwater vulnerability analysis addresses the degree of sensitivity of groundwater system towards changes in both intrinsic/inherent and extrinsic factors. With this aim, an integrated FAHP-GIS-based modified DRASTIC (DRASTIC-L) method was followed in order to address the response of various hydro-geological indicators towards attenuation of pollutant to sub-surface hydrological regime in two differently urbanized clusters of Kozhikode district in Kerala, Southern India. Rating for the DRASTIC-L factors was derived with the aid of Fuzzy based Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP). Spatial and non-spatial information was integrated into a GIS environment. The resultant spatial data thus generated depicted that about 71% of urban and 22% of peri-urban zones of the study area, which are characterised by porous and permeable vadose media with shallow groundwater table, have a high to very high vulnerability index value. Majority of highly vulnerable urban area extends 0\u201310\u202fkm from the coastal line and has a dense population. Of the total study area, 8% urban and 38.5% of peri-urban area with low index value indicated that the groundwater in the zone is protected from contaminant's leaching due to its inherent hydrogeology. Low porous vadose media and the presence of steep slope terrain favors this low vulnerability. Besides the remaining area shows moderate vulnerability to contamination. Single - parameter and map-removal sensitivity analyses highlighted that vadose zone characteristic has the highest influence on vulnerability assessment. The resultant vulnerability index values validated with composite groundwater quality index data depicted the significant correlation among them. Thus, the groundwater vulnerability index map is an efficient tool for water-sensitive urban development.", "Hydrogeochemical characteristics with respect to fluoride contamination in groundwater of Maheshwarm mandal, RR district, Telangana state, India ": "Groundwater samples were collected in Maheshwaram mandal, Ranga Reddy district, Telangana State, India for two seasons (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon) and analyzed for chemical parameters with respect to fluoride. The fluoride concentration ranges from 0.31 to 3.03\u202fmg/l and 0.28\u20132.58\u202fmg/l during pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) seasons respectively. Results showed that water samples were contaminated with presence of fluoride ion. High fluoride concentration recorded during PRM 62% and POM 38% when compared with World Health Organization tolerance limit of 1.5\u202fmg/l. The higher ratio of Na/Ca indicates dissolution of fluoride minerals at higher pH and the HCO3/Ca ratio indicate the condition favoring to dissolution of fluoride ions. Hydrogeochemical facies distribution indicates water-rock interaction resulted in occurrence of high fluoride concentration in groundwater. Analytical results plotted on Gibb's diagram indicate rock and evaporation dominance. Principal component analysis indicates hydrogeochemical processes like weathering, ion exchange, and anthropogenic activities contribute to groundwater chemistry.", "Common effluent treatment plant (CETP): Reliability analysis and performance evaluation ": "Common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) have been installed and are in operation at numerous industrial clusters throughout India. They serve to reduce effluent treatment cost, provide better collective treatment, and reduce land cost for small-scale industrial facilities that cannot afford individual treatment plants. Optimum working conditions for treatment of effluent to be at par with discharge standards is a major mandate for any CETP. In this study, the reliability and removal efficiencies (REs) of a CETP in the industrial area of Maharashtra State in India were examined. An established methodology was adopted to determine the effectiveness of the CETP in terms of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease (O&G) concentrations. The CETP's compliance with respect to design standards and its operation were studied in detail. This paper highlights the results of RE and the coefficient of determination (R\n                     2) values obtained from the CETP data, estimates the pollutants removed at the highest and lowest rates over a period of time, and highlights the reasons for problem areas along with remedial measures. It was observed that, except O&G, all the parameters (BOD, COD, and TSS) showed fluctuations in removal efficiencies and their reliabilities. This situation can be improved by releasing effluent containing hydraulic and organic loading to the CETP as per standards and optimizing treatment processes, especially primary clari-flocculators and aeration tanks, both of which are important units of any CETP.", "A simple formula for predicting settling velocity of sediment particles ": "Based on the general relationship described by Cheng between the drag coefficient and the Reynolds number of a particle, a new relationship between the Reynolds number and a dimensionless particle parameter is proposed. Using a trial-and-error procedure to minimize errors, the coefficients were determined and a formula was developed for predicting the settling velocity of natural sediment particles. This formula has higher prediction accuracy than other published formulas and it is applicable to all Reynolds numbers less than 2\u00d7105.", "Performance assessment of two-dimensional hydraulic models for generation of flood inundation maps in mountain river basins ": "Hydraulic models for the generation of flood inundation maps are not commonly applied in mountain river basins because of the difficulty in modeling the hydraulic behavior and the complex topography. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of four two-dimensional hydraulic models (HEC-RAS 2D, Iber 2D, Flood Modeller 2D, and PCSWMM 2D) with respect to the generation of flood inundation maps. The study area covers a 5-km reach of the Santa B\u00e1rbara River located in the Ecuadorian Andes, at 2330 masl, in Gualaceo. The model's performance was evaluated based on the water surface elevation and flood extent, in terms of the mean absolute difference and measure of fit. The analysis revealed that, for a given case, Iber 2D has the best performance in simulating the water level and inundation for flood events with 20- and 50-year return periods, respectively, followed by Flood Modeller 2D, HEC-RAS 2D, and PCSWMM 2D in terms of their performance. Grid resolution, the way in which hydraulic structures are mimicked, the model code, and the default value of the parameters are considered the main sources of prediction uncertainty.", "Experimental and numerical analysis of flow over a rectangular full-width sharp-crested weir ": "Weirs are a type of hydraulic structure, used for water level adjustment, flow measurement, and diversion of water in irrigation systems. In this study, experiments were conducted on sharp-crested weirs under free-flow conditions and an optimization method was used to determine the best form of the discharge coefficient equation based on the coefficient of determination (R\n                     2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The ability of the numerical method to simulate the flow over the weir was also investigated using Fluent software. Results showed that, with an increase of the ratio of the head over the weir crest to the weir height (h/P), the discharge coefficient decreased nonlinearly and reached a constant value of 0.7 for h/P\u00a0>\u00a00.6. The best form of the discharge coefficient equation predicted the discharge coefficient well and percent errors were within a \u00b15% error limit. Numerical results of the discharge coefficient showed strong agreement with the experimental data. Variation of the discharge coefficient with Reynolds numbers showed that the discharge coefficient reached a constant value of 0.7 when h/P\u00a0>\u00a00.6 and Re\u00a0>\u00a020000.", "Correlations between silt density index, turbidity and oxidation-reduction potential parameters in seawater reverse osmosis desalination ": "The reverse osmosis method is one of the most widely used methods of seawater desalination at present. Hydrophilic and desalting membranes in reverse osmosis systems are highly susceptible to the input pollutants. Various contaminants, including suspended organic and inorganic matter, result in membrane fouling and membrane degradation. Fundamental parameters such as the turbidity, the amount of chlorine injection, and silt density index (SDI) are the most predominant parameters of fouling control in the membranes. In this study, the operation system included a water intake unit, a pretreatment system, and an RO system. The pretreatment system encompassed a clarifier, a gravity sand filter, pressurized sand filters, and a cartridge filter. The correlation between the amount of chlorine injection in terms of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and the SDI value of the input water was investigated at a specified site next to the Persian Gulf. The results showed that, at certain intervals of inlet turbidity, injection of a certain amount of chlorine into the raw water has a distinct effect on the decrease of SDI.", "Using multi-satellite microwave remote sensing observations for retrieval of daily surface soil moisture across China ": "The objective of this study was to retrieve daily composite soil moisture by jointly using brightness temperature observations from multiple operating satellites for near real-time application with better coverage and higher accuracy. Our approach was to first apply the single-channel brightness radiometric algorithm to estimate soil moisture from the respective brightness temperature observations of the SMAP, SMOS, AMSR2, FY3B, and FY3C satellites on the same day and then produce a daily composite dataset by averaging the individual satellite-retrieved soil moisture. We further evaluated our product, the official soil moisture products of the five satellites, and the ensemble mean (i.e., arithmetic mean) of the five official satellite soil moisture products against ground observations from two networks in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, China. The results show that our product outperforms the individual released products of the five satellites and their ensemble means in the two validation areas. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of our product were 0.06 and 0.09\u00a0m3/m3 in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. Relative to the ensemble mean of the five satellite products, our product improves the accuracy by 9.1% and 57.7% in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. This demonstrates that jointly using brightness temperature observations from multiple satellites to retrieve soil moisture not only improves the spatial coverage of daily observations but also produces better daily composite products.", "Evaluation of copper removal efficiency using water treatment sludge ": "Large quantities of sludge are produced during water treatment processes. Recently, sludge has been treated as waste and disposed of in landfills, which increases the environmental burdens and the operational cost. Therefore, sludge reuse has become a significant environmental issue. In this study, adsorption of copper ions (Cu2+) onto calcined sludge was investigated under various operational conditions (with varying temperature, Cu2+ initial concentration, pH, and sludge dosage). The prepared sludge material was characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. The sorption capacity of sludge was directly proportional to the initial Cu2+ concentration and inversely proportional to the sludge dosage. The optimum operational pH and solution temperature were 6.6 and 80\u00b0C, respectively. The experimental results followed a Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-first-order adsorption kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters such as activation energy, change in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy were calculated. Thermodynamic analyses indicated that the sorption of copper ions onto the calcined sludge was driven by a physical adsorption process. The prepared sludge was proven to be an excellent adsorbent material for the removal of Cu2+ from an aqueous solution under optimum conditions.", "River bank protection from ship-induced waves and river flow ": "A new equation is proposed for the design of armor units on protected river banks under the combined action of ship-induced waves and river flow. Existing observed field and experimental data in the literature have been examined and a valuable database has been developed. Different conditions, including the river water depth, flow velocity, river bank slope, Froude number, wave height, wave period, and wave obliquity have been considered. Results from an empirical equation (Bhowmik, 1978) that only considers the maximum wave height and river bank slope have been compared with the results calculated by the newly developed equation. Calculated results have also been verified against field data. Results show that not only the maximum wave height and river bank slope but also the water depth, flow velocity, wave length, wave obliquity, and wave period are important parameters for predicting the mean diameter of the armor units, highlighting the multivariate behavior of protecting the river bank in the presence of ship-induced waves and river flow velocity.", "Understanding groundwater table using a statistical model ": "In this study, a statistical model was established to estimate the groundwater table using precipitation, evaporation, the river stage of the Liangduo River, and the tide level of the Yellow Sea, as well as to predict the groundwater table with easily measurable climate data in a coastal plain in eastern China. To achieve these objectives, groundwater table data from twelve wells in a farmland covering an area of 50\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0m were measured over a 12-month period in 2013 in Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province. Trend analysis and correlation analysis were conducted to study the patterns of changes in the groundwater table. In addition, a linear regression model was established and regression analysis was conducted to understand the relationships between precipitation, evaporation, river stage, tide level, and groundwater table. The results are as follows: (1) The groundwater table was strongly affected by climate factors (e.g., precipitation and evaporation), and river stage was also a significant factor affecting the groundwater table in the study area (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, where p is the probability value). (2) The groundwater table was especially sensitive to precipitation. The significance of the factors of the groundwater table were ranked in the following descending order: precipitation, evaporation, and river stage. (3) A triple linear regression model of the groundwater table, precipitation, evaporation, and river stage was established. The linear relationship between the groundwater table and the main factors was satisfied by the actual values versus the simulated values of the groundwater table (R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.841, where R\n                     2 is the coefficient of determination).", "Impacts of rainfall and catchment characteristics on bioretention cell performance ": "Although many studies have evaluated the impacts of bioretention cell (BRC) design elements on hydrologic performance, few have investigated the roles played by site characteristics and rainfall patterns. The objectives of this study were to assess the impacts of rainfall and catchments with different characteristics on the hydrologic performance of BRCs and identify important factors in sizing bioretention when hydrologic performance was oriented for the design using a modeling approach. A 10-year record of rainfall data was used to identify the frequency and magnitude of rainfall events. The results showed that although the small and medium rainfall events were dominant they contributed less to the total rainfall depth than the large rainfall events. The ratio of runoff coefficient to imperviousness can be used as an indicator to explain why BRCs perform differently with the same design strategy under the same rainfall events. Rainfall patterns had significant impacts on the hydrologic performance of BRCs by influencing the overflow and underdrain flow. BRCs performed better for rainfall events with a longer duration and lower rainfall intensity because they generated smoother runoff processes into the BRCs. On the basis of these results, the runoff coefficient is suggested for BRC surface design.", "Submerged flexible vegetation impact on open channel flow velocity distribution: An analytical modelling study on drag and friction ": "In this paper, an analytical model that represents the streamwise velocity distribution for open channel flow with submerged flexible vegetation is studied. In the present vegetated flow modelling, the whole flow field has been separated into two layers vertically: a vegetated layer and a non-vegetated free-water layer. Within the vegetated layer, an analysis of the mechanisms affecting water flow through flexible vegetation has been conducted. In the non-vegetated layer, a modified log-law equation that represents the velocity profile varying with vegetation height has been investigated. Based on the studied analytical model, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess the influences of the drag (\n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 C\n                              \n                              \n                                 D\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     ) and friction (\n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 C\n                              \n                              \n                                 f\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     ) coefficients on the flow velocity.

A Harten-Lax-van Leer-contact (HLLC) approximate Riemann solver was used to evaluate fluxes. The TVD MUSCL-Hancock numerical scheme utilizes slope limiters, such as the minmod, double minmod, superbee, van Albada, and van Leer limiters, to prevent spurious oscillations and maintain monotonicity near discontinuities. A comparative study of the impact of various slope limiters on the accuracy of the numerical flow model was conducted with several dam-break examples including wet and dry bed cases. The numerical results of the superbee and double minmod limiters agree better with the theoretical solution and have higher accuracy than other limiters in one-dimensional (1D) space. The ratio of the downstream water depth to the upstream water depth was used to select the proper slope limiter. For the 2D numerical model, the superbee limiter should not be used, owing to significant numerical dispersion.", "High-resolution flood modeling of urban areas using MSN_Flood ": "Although existing hydraulic models have been used to simulate and predict urban flooding, most of these models are inadequate due to the high spatial resolution required to simulate flows in urban floodplains. Nesting high-resolution subdomains within coarser-resolution models is an efficient solution for enabling simultaneous calculation of flooding due to tides, surges, and high river flows. MSN_Flood has been developed to incorporate moving boundaries around nested domains, permitting alternate flooding and drying along the boundary and in the interior of the domain. Ghost cells adjacent to open boundary cells convert open boundaries, in effect, into internal boundaries. The moving boundary may be multi-segmented and non-continuous, with recirculating flow across the boundary. When combined with a bespoke adaptive interpolation scheme, this approach facilitates a dynamic internal boundary. Based on an alternating-direction semi-implicit finite difference scheme, MSN_Flood was used to hindcast a major flood event in Cork City resulting from the combined pressures of fluvial, tidal, and storm surge processes. The results show that the model is computationally efficient, as the 2-m high-resolution nest is used only in the urban flooded region. Elsewhere, lower-resolution nests are used. The results also show that the model is highly accurate when compared with measured data. The model is capable of incorporating nested sub-domains when the nested boundary is multi-segmented and highly complex with lateral gradients of elevation and velocities. This is a major benefit when modelling urban floodplains at very high resolution.", "Calculation of passive earth pressure of cohesive soil based on Culmann's method ": "Based on the sliding plane hypothesis of Coulumb earth pressure theory, a new method for calculation of the passive earth pressure of cohesive soil was constructed with Culmann's graphical construction. The influences of the cohesive force, adhesive force, and the fill surface form were considered in this method. In order to obtain the passive earth pressure and sliding plane angle, a program based on the sliding surface assumption was developed with the VB.NET programming language. The calculated results from this method were basically the same as those from the Rankine theory and Coulumb theory formulas. This method is conceptually clear, and the corresponding formulas given in this paper are simple and convenient for application when the fill surface form is complex.", "Computational investigation of hydraulic performance variation with geometry in gabion stepped spillways ": "Over recent years, there has been a clear increase in the frequency of reported flooding events around the world. Gabion structures offer one means of flood mitigation in dam spillways. These types of structures provide an additional challenge to the computational modeller in that flow through the porous gabions must be simulated. We have used a computational model to investigate the flow over gabion stepped spillways. The model was first validated against published experimental results. Then, gabion stepped spillways with four different step geometries were tested under the same conditions in order to facilitate inter-comparisons and to choose the best option in terms of energy dissipation. The results show that normal gabion steps can dissipate more energy than overlap, inclined, and pooled steps. An intensive set of tests with varying slope, stone size, and porosity were undertaken. The location of the inception point and the water depth at this point obtained from this study were compared with those from existing formulae. Two new empirical equations have been derived, on the basis of a regression analysis, to provide improved results for gabion stepped spillways.", "Modeling river water quality parameters using modified adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system ": "Water quality is always one of the most important factors in human health. Artificial intelligence models are respected methods for modeling water quality. The evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a new technique for improving the performance of artificial intelligence models such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Attempts have been made to make the models more suitable and accurate with the replacement of other training methods that do not suffer from some shortcomings, including a tendency to being trapped in local optima or voluminous computations. This study investigated the applicability of ANFIS with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization for continuous domains (ACOR) in estimating water quality parameters at three stations along the Zayandehrood River, in Iran. The ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-ACOR methods were also compared with the classic ANFIS method, which uses least squares and gradient descent as training algorithms. The estimated water quality parameters in this study were electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), carbonate hardness (CH), and total hardness (TH). Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS software to determine the optimal inputs to the models. The analysis showed that ANFIS-PSO was the better model compared with ANFIS-ACOR. It is noteworthy that EA models can improve ANFIS' performance at all three stations for different water quality parameters.", "Numerical simulation of flow separation over a backward-facing step with high Reynolds number ": "Large eddy simulation (LES) explicitly calculates the large-scale vortex field and parameterizes the small-scale vortices. In this study, LES and \u03ba-\u03b5 models were developed for a specific geometrical configuration of backward-facing step (BFS). The simulation results were validated with particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and direct numerical simulation (DNS). This LES simulation was carried out with a Reynolds number of 9000 in a pressurized water tunnel with an expansion ratio of 2.00. The results indicate that the LES model can reveal large-scale vortex motion although with a larger grid-cell size. However, the LES model tends to overestimate the top wall separation and the Reynolds stress components for the BFS flow simulation without a sufficiently fine grid. Overall, LES is a potential tool for simulating separated flow controlled by large-scale vortices.", "Biosorption of Ni(II) ions from aqueous solution using modified Aloe barbadensis Miller leaf powder ": "This study aimed to investigate the biosorption potential of Na2CO3-modified Aloe barbadensis Miller (Aloe vera) leaf (MABL) powder for removal of Ni(II) ions from a synthetic aqueous solution. Effects of various process parameters (pH, equilibrium time, and temperature) were investigated in order to optimize the biosorptive removal. The maximum biosorption capacity of MABL was observed to be 28.986\u00a0mg/g at a temperature of 303\u00a0K, a biosorbent dose of 0.6\u00a0g, a contact time of 90\u00a0min, and a pH value of 7. Different kinetic models (the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models) were evaluated. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to be the best fitted model in this study, with a coefficient of determination of R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.974. Five different isotherm models (the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) models) were investigated to identify the best-suited isotherm model for the present system. Based on the minimum chi-square value (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a00.027) and the maximum coefficient of determination (R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.996), the Langmuir isotherm model was found to represent the system well, indicating the possibility of monolayer biosorption. The sticking probability (S*) was found to be 0.41, suggesting a physisorption mechanism for biosorption of Ni(II) on MABL. The biosorbent was characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential, and BET surface area, in order to understand its morphological and functional characteristics.", "Stability analysis of unsaturated soil slope during rainfall infiltration using coupled liquid-gas-solid three-phase model ": "Generally, most soil slope failures are induced by rainfall infiltration, a process that involves interactions between the liquid phase, gas phase, and solid skeleton in an unsaturated soil slope. In this study, a loosely coupled liquid-gas-solid three-phase model, linking two numerical codes, TOUGH2/EOS3, which is used for water-air two-phase flow analysis, and FLAC3D, which is used for mechanical analysis, was established. The model was validated through a documented water drainage experiment over a sandy column and a comparison of the results with measured data and simulated results from other researchers. The proposed model was used to investigate the features of water-air two-phase flow and stress fields in an unsaturated soil slope during rainfall infiltration. The slope stability analysis was then performed based on the simulated water-air two-phase seepage and stress fields on a given slip surface. The results show that the safety factor for the given slip surface decreases first, then increases, and later decreases until the rainfall stops. Subsequently, a sudden rise occurs. After that, the safety factor decreases continually and reaches its lowest value, and then increases slowly to a steady value. The lowest value does not occur when the rainfall stops, indicating a delayed effect of the safety factor. The variations of the safety factor for the given slip surface are therefore caused by a combination of pore-air pressure, matric suction, normal stress, and net normal stress.", "On-site stormwater detention for Australian development projects: Does it meet frequent flow management objectives? ": "On-site stormwater detention (OSD) is a conventional component of urban drainage systems, designed with the intention of mitigating the increase to peak discharge of stormwater runoff that inevitably results from urbanization. In Australia, singular temporal patterns for design storms have governed the inputs of hydrograph generation and in turn the design process of OSD for the last three decades. This paper raises the concern that many existing OSD systems designed using the singular temporal pattern for design storms may not be achieving their stated objectives when they are assessed against a variety of alternative temporal patterns. The performance of twenty real OSD systems was investigated using two methods: (1) ensembles of design temporal patterns prescribed in the latest version of Australian Rainfall and Runoff, and (2) real recorded rainfall data taken from pluviograph stations modeled with continuous simulation. It is shown conclusively that the use of singular temporal patterns is ineffective in providing assurance that an OSD will mitigate the increase to peak discharge for all possible storm events. Ensemble analysis is shown to provide improved results. However, it also falls short of providing any guarantee in the face of naturally occurring rainfall.", "Application of HEC-HMS for flood forecasting in Misai and Wan'an catchments in China ": "The hydrologic model HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Center, Hydrologic Modeling System), used in combination with the Geospatial Hydrologic Modeling Extension, HEC-GeoHMS, is not a site-specific hydrologic model. Although China has seen the applications of many hydrologic and hydraulic models, HEC-HMS is seldom applied in China, and where it is applied, it is not applied holistically. This paper presents a holistic application of HEC-HMS. Its applicability, capability and suitability for flood forecasting in catchments were examined. The DEMs (digital elevation models) of the study areas were processed using HEC-GeoHMS, an ArcView GIS extension for catchment delineation, terrain pre-processing, and basin processing. The model was calibrated and verified using historical observed data. The determination coefficients and coefficients of agreement for all the flood events were above 0.9, and the relative errors in peak discharges were all within the acceptable range.", "Measurement and assessment of water resources carrying capacity in Henan Province, China ": "As demands on limited water resources intensify, concerns are being raised about water resources carrying capacity (WRCC), which is defined as the maximum sustainable socioeconomic scale that can be supported by available water resources and while maintaining defined environmental conditions. This paper proposes a distributed quantitative model for WRCC, based on the principles of optimization, and considering hydro-economic interaction, water supply, water quality, and socioeconomic development constraints. With the model, the WRCCs of 60 subregions in Henan Province were determined for different development periods. The results showed that the water resources carrying level of Henan Province was suitably loaded in 2010, but that the province would be mildly overloaded in 2030 with respect to the socioeconomic development planning goals. The restricting factors for WRCC included the available water resources, the increasing rate of GDP, the urbanization ratio, the irrigation water utilization coefficient, the industrial water recycling rate, and the wastewater reuse rate, of which the available water resources was the most crucial factor. Because these factors varied temporally and spatially, the trends in predicted WRCC were inconsistent across different subregions and periods.", "Impact of climate change on hydropower generation in Rio Jubones Basin,\u00a0Ecuador ": "This study attempted to use the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), integrated with geographic information systems (GIS), for assessment of climate change impacts on hydropower generation. This methodology of climate change impact modeling was developed and demonstrated through application to a hydropower plant in the Rio Jubones Basin in Ecuador. ArcSWAT 2012 was used to develop a model for simulating the river flow. The model parameters were calibrated and validated on a monthly scale with respect to the hydro-meteorological inputs observed from 1985 to 1991 and from 1992 to 1998, respectively. Statistical analyses produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSEs) of 0.66 and 0.61 for model calibration and validation, respectively, which were considered acceptable. Numerical simulation with the model indicated that climate change could alter the seasonal flow regime of the basin, and the hydropower potential could change due to the changing climate in the future. Scenario analysis indicates that, though the hydropower generation will increase in the wet season, the plant will face a significant power shortage during the dry season, up to 13.14% from the reference scenario, as a consequence of a 17% reduction of streamflow under an assumption of a 2.9\u00b0C increase in temperature and a 15% decrease in rainfall. Overall, this study showed that hydrological processes are realistically modeled with SWAT and the model can be a useful tool for predicting the impact of climate change.", "Flume experimental study on evolution of a mouth bar under interaction of floods and waves ": "Based on the characteristics of hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the bar area in the Modaomen Estuary, a flume experiment was performed to study the evolution of the longitudinal profile of the mouth bar. The mouth bar evolution was investigated under the impacts of floods with different return periods as well as flood-wave interaction. The results showed that floods with different return periods had significant influences on the evolution of the river mouth bar. Particularly on the inner slope of the mouth bar, the sediment was substantially active and moveable. The inner slope and the bar crest tended to be remarkably scoured. The erosion was intensified with the increase of the magnitude of floods. Moreover, the bar crest moved seawards, while the elevation of the bar crest barely changed. Under the flood-wave interaction, a remarkable amount of erosion on the inner and outer slopes of the mouth bar was also found. The seaward displacement of the bar crest under the interaction of floods and waves was less than it was under only the impact of floods, while more deposition was found on the crest of the mouth bar in this case.", "A comparative study of pseudo-static slope stability analysis using different design codes ": "Many researchers have developed new calculation methods to analyze seismic slope stability problems, but the conventional pseudo-static method is still widely used in engineering design due to its simplicity. Based on the Technical Code for Building Slope Engineering (GB\u00a050330\u20142013) of China and the Guidelines for Evaluating and Mitigating Seismic Hazards in California (SP117), a comparative study on the pseudo-static method was performed. The results indicate that the largest difference between these two design codes lies in determination of the seismic equivalence reduction factor (f\n                     eq). The GB 50330\u20142013 code specifies a single value for f\n                     eq of 0.25. In SP117, numerous factors, such as magnitude and distance, are considered in determining f\n                     eq. Two case studies show that the types of slope stability status evaluated by SP117 are in agreement with those evaluated by the seismic time-history stability analysis and Newmark displacement analysis. The factors of safety evaluated by SP117 can be used in practice for safe design. However, the factors of safety evaluated by GB 50330\u20142013 are risky for slope seismic design.", "Do farmers value rice varieties tolerant to droughts and floods? Evidence from a discrete choice experiment in Odisha, India ": "Abiotic stresses such as droughts and floods significantly constrain rice production in India. New stress tolerant technologies have the potential to reduce yield variability and help insulate farmers from the risks posed by these hazards. Using discrete choice experiments conducted in rural Odisha, we estimate farmers' valuation for drought-tolerant (DT) and submergence-tolerant (SubT) traits embodied in rice cultivars. Our results demonstrate that farmers in both drought-prone as well as submergence prone regions value reduction in yield variability offered by new, stress-tolerant cultivars, and would generally be willing to pay a significant premium for these traits. While virtually all farmers perceive the threat of drought and are willing to pay for protection against drought risk, only farmers in flood-prone areas would be willing to pay for rice that can withstand being submerged for prolonged periods, suggesting the potential for market segmentation along geographical or ecological lines.", "Determining payments for watershed services by hydro-economic modeling for optimal water allocation between agricultural and municipal water use ": "", "Effects of water quality changes on the recreation benefits of swimming in Finland: Combined travel cost and contingent behavior model ": "Finland is a highly coastal country with a large archipelago area and numerous lakes. Consequently, these provide an essential environment for water-based outdoor recreation activities. To improve the information base for evaluating the welfare effects of policy instruments addressing water quality, such as the EU Water Framework Directive, this study examined the effects of changes in water quality on the recreation benefits, focusing on swimming trips in Finland. National recreation inventory data were used to provide information on welfare changes at the national level. The combined travel cost and contingent behavior approach revealed that the recreation value of a swimming trip in the current state was approximately 16 euros. The approach allowed assessment of the welfare effects of water quality changes beyond the observed levels, showing that a hypothetical decrease in water quality to a level at which the water visibility would be less than 1\u00a0m and abundant slime would exist decreased the value to 9 euros. Water quality improvement to a level at which the perceived water visibility would be over 2\u00a0m and no slime would exist increased the value per trip to 22 euros. In total, the overall annual value of all visits made for swimming in the case of water quality improvement increased the recreation benefits by 53\u201380%, while a deterioration in quality decreased the benefits by approximately 80%.", "Analyzing the economic value of thermal power plant cooling water consumption ": "The consumption of water by thermal power plants for cooling purposes has presented several policy and resource allocation challenges in the recent past. There is need for improved economic understanding of thermal power plant water consumption to better address these challenges. In this paper, we examine the economic efficiency of water consumption substitutes for existing thermal power plants. In the long run, a power plant could reduce water consumption by investing in efficiency improvements. In the short run, a power plant could reduce water consumption by curtailing power output. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that these substitutes are not economically efficient; water prices in excess of $1.00/m3 would be required for power plants to make efficiency investments or curtail output. Thermal power plants are therefore not attractive targets for water consumption reduction initiatives based on pricing alone. Furthermore, in the long run, efficiency improvements only show significant water reduction potential for the most inefficient plants. However, the findings of the short run analysis indicate that since thermal power plants are willing to pay water prices in excess of $1.00/m3 before curtailing output, these power plants do not require free reallocation of water from senior water rights holders during periods of scarcity, as has been the practice in several regions. Instead, a more efficient water policy focus would be creation of enabling environments for water market transactions. Such water market transactions could help balance competing water demands during periods of scarcity, while maintaining reliable electricity supply.", "Exploring the potential of local market in remunerating water ecosystem services in Cambodia: An application for endogenous attribute non-attendance modelling ": "Within South East Asia, certification and local market development may play an important role in incentivizing farmers to continue with nature-based solutions delivered by organic or traditional farming practices and avoid using environmentally detrimental production techniques. The purpose of this study is to use economic valuation in order to achieve an empirical understanding of local consumer preferences for different attributes of rice products. Application of the agrarian system approach reveals that rice cultivation systems observed in the Tonle Sape Lake of the Mekong River Basin in Cambodia (our study case) may target three ecosystem services that present the characteristics of public goods and may benefit consumer support. A choice experiment survey was administered among local consumers in the city of Phnom Penh in 2013. Econometric analysis indicates high rate of non-attendance for the price attribute. It also suggests that 17% of the respondents made their choices neglecting attributes describing ecosystem services. However, there are evidence of consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for certified organic rice higher than the price-premium observed on the local market. Furthermore, there is additional WTP value for the preservation of ecosystem services. We discuss the implications of our findings on potential payment for ecosystem services in the specific case of rice.", "How far can investment in efficient irrigation technologies reduce aquifer overdraft? Insights from an expert elicitation in Aguascalientes, Mexico ": "Aquifer overdraft is a key public concern in arid and semiarid regions \u2014where agriculture is responsible of most of the water extraction. To tackle this problem, policy interventions in those regions most frequently focus on investment in irrigation technologies. However, these investments are usually carried out without consideration of the effects on water extraction. Estimation of such effects tend to be expensive and time-consuming because they vary depending on technology- and location-specific conditions, and their interactions. Thus there is the demand for methodologies that can provide cheaper estimates, even if rough. This paper explores whether an expert elicitation can provide insights on the impacts that are reasonable to expect from specific efficient irrigation technologies. Our case study is the aquifer of Valle de Aguascalientes, Mexico \u2014where extraction is more than 80% above of the natural recharge. We have learned that our experts in agronomy and hydrology do not expect that sprinkler or drip technologies will substantially reduce overdraft. These results are policy relevant because both types of technologies are at center of the strategies proposed by the policy makers aiming to solve aquifer overdraft in Aguascalientes.", "Valuing water: Selected applications ": "", "Modeling dynamics and adaptation at operational and structural scales for the ex-ante economic evaluation of large dams in an African context ": "Dams can produce electricity and ensure water security, but at the same time they radically alter the hydrological regime of rivers with significant consequences for the economic and environmental welfare of the region in which they are located. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is currently the most frequently used framework for the economic evaluations of dams. Changes at different time scales influence the economic appraisal of dams. However, change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural level are often not included in the CBA evaluation. Not including change and adaptation limits the realistic estimation of cost and benefits, and the appreciation of resilient solutions that offer satisfactory responses for a large set of future scenarios.\n                  In this paper we consider the specific features of large dams in an African context, and identify methods for an economic evaluation that takes into account for change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural scales, as well as their interplay. These methods are then applied to the ex-ante evaluation of a system of existing dams on the Senegal River Valley. Results indicate the economic potential of the dams under changing conditions, for both adaptive and non-adaptive reservoir operation strategies.", "A micro-scale cost-benefit analysis of building-level flood risk adaptation measures in Los Angeles ": "Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of flood risk adaptation strategies offers policymakers insight into economically optimal strategies for adapting to sea level rise. However, building-level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or building elevation are often evaluated at aggregated spatial scales, which may result in sub-optimal investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a flood risk model and combine it with a micro-scale CBA at the building level to obtain an optimal mix of adaptation measures per area. We apply this approach to Venice Beach in Los Angeles and Naples in Long Beach. We subsequently compare our results with the conventional, spatially aggregated area-based CBA approach. Our findings show that a mix of 35%\u201345% dry-floodproofing measures and 55%\u201365% building elevation measures is optimal. Elevation works best in areas with high inundation depths, while dry-floodproofing is preferable in areas with shallow inundation depths. The optimal mix of measures derived from our micro-scale approach results in an economic efficiency up to 85% higher than that yielded by the commonly applied spatially aggregated approach. We therefore recommend that economic evaluations of building-level adaptation measures are conducted at the smallest possible scale, or that CBAs are performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth.", "Climate change and agriculture: Impacts and adaptation options in South Africa ": "South Africa is likely to experience higher temperatures and less rainfall as a result of climate change. Resulting changes in regional water endowments and soil moisture will affect the productivity of cropland, leading to changes in food production and international trade patterns. High population growth elsewhere in Africa and Asia will put further pressure on natural resources and food security in South Africa. Based on four climate change scenarios from two general circulation models (CSIRO and MIROC) and two IPCC SRES emission scenarios (A1B, B1), this study assesses the potential impacts of climate change on global agriculture and explores two alternative adaptation scenarios for South Africa. The analysis uses an updated GTAP-W model, which distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated agriculture and implements water as an explicit factor of production for irrigated agriculture. For South Africa to adapt to the adverse consequences of global climate change, it would require yield improvements of more than 20 percent over baseline investments in agricultural research and development. A doubling of irrigation development, on the other hand, will not be sufficient to reverse adverse impacts from climate change in the country.", "Household behavior related to water conservation ": "This research investigates the role of the level, structure, and rate of change of water prices, as well as non-price policies and socio-demographic characteristics on households' decision-making regarding indoor and outdoor water conservation practices. In this paper, indoor water conservation choices refer to the presence/absence of low volume toilets and low flow showers in the home. Outdoor water conservation choices refer to the frequency of lawn and garden watering by the household during summer months. The former is estimated with a bivariate probit model, while the latter requires an ordered bi-variate probit model. The data come from Statistics Canada's 2006 Households and the Environment Survey. It provides a national cross-sectional sample of household-level observations on indoor and outdoor water choices. These data are linked to municipal level information on residential water prices, non-price water conservation policies, and weather information assembled by the authors. Potential endogeneity arising from the presence of price and non-price water policy variables is investigated using a simultaneous equations approach. Estimation results provide several insights. First, water prices and household characteristics play important roles in shaping household decision-making regarding both indoor and outdoor water conservation. Second, there is little evidence that non-price water conservation policies influence either indoor or outdoor decision-making. Third, there is evidence of correlation for the two indoor water-conserving choices and also for the frequency of lawn and garden watering decisions. Finally, there is no evidence of endogeneity of water prices and other policy variables.", "Economic valuation of river restoration: An analysis of the valuation literature and its uses in decision-making ": "This paper provides an analysis of existing non-market valuations of river restoration primarily in the United States and Europe. The goals of the river restoration in terms of ecosystem services are identified, as are the valuation methods used. More than two-thirds of the 38 river restorations reviewed sought to restore and protect fish populations, including in many cases threatened or endangered species. River restorations were also frequently undertaken to improve wildlife habitat, and water quality for boating. In terms of the use of non-market valuations in decision making, six of 38 restorations reviewed involved benefit-cost analyses or environmental assessments or equivalent decision documents. While both revealed preference and stated preference methods were used for valuing river restorations, the majority of restoration valuations (27 out of 38, about 70%) utilized stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation method (CVM) and choice experiments (CE). Annual willingness-to-pay per household estimated from the stated preference methods appear logically and positively related to the miles of river restored demonstrating weak scope.", "Financial comparison of seven nitrate reduction strategies for Midwestern agricultural drainage ": "Much work has been invested in the development of practices and technologies that reduce nitrate losses from agricultural drainage in the US Midwest. While each individual practice can be valuable, the effectiveness will be site specific and the acceptability of each approach will differ between producers. To enhance decision making in terms of water quality practices, this work created average cost effectiveness parameters for seven nitrate management strategies (controlled drainage, wetlands, denitrification bioreactors, nitrogen management rate and timing, cover crops, and crop rotation). For each practice, available published cost information was used to develop a farm-level financial model that assessed establishment and maintenance costs as well as examined financial effects of potential yield impacts. Then, each practice's cost values were combined with literature review of N reduction (% N load reduction), which allowed comparison of these seven practices in terms of cost effectiveness (dollars per kg N removed). At \u2212$14 and \u2212$1.60kgN\u22121\n                     yr\u22121, springtime nitrogen application and nitrogen application rate reduction were the most cost effective practices. The in-field vegetative practices of cover crop and crop rotation were the least cost effective (means: $55 and $43kgN\u22121\n                     yr\u22121, respectively). With means of less than $3kgN\u22121\n                     yr\u22121, controlled drainage, wetlands, and bioreactors were fairly comparable with each other. While no individual technology or management approach will be capable of addressing drainage water quality concerns in entirety, this analysis provides measures of average cost effectiveness across these seven strategies that allows direct comparison.", "WTP for water filters and water quality testing services in Guatemala ": "We conduct a contingent valuation study to estimate the willingness to pay for a point-of-use water quality technology and water quality testing services in the highlands of Guatemala. This study is unique in two ways: we measure drinking water quality at the household level through water samples collected at the household and we elicit the willingness to pay for water quality testing services. We find a significant divergence in subjects\u2019 perceptions of water quality and the measured bacteria counts in their household water. This divergence is economically important as perceptions may play a significant role in willingness to pay for water quality improvements.", "Irrigation reservoirs as blue clubs: Governance and policy intervention ": "", "Economic evaluation of green water in cereal crop production: A production function approach ": "A great majority of agricultural water is provided by precipitation that is stored in soil moisture, defined as green water. This water evaporates or transpires through plants, and plays a determinative role in crop growth particularly for rainfed agriculture. This study aims to assess the economic value of green water production factor that has often been ignored in the literature, as the focus was mainly given on blue water resources. We employed the production function valuation method and specify a Cobb-Douglas production function, using cereal production in the Czech Republic as a case-study. Green water use was quantified through CROPWAT model, using year-to-year precipitation and evapotranspiration data at a national level for the period 1993-2014. The green water use values were incorporated into the production function, and the marginal value of green water was elicited by computing its marginal contribution with annual average crop market prices. Estimations were based on empirical time-series data at the national level. The marginal value of green water ranged from 17 to 25 USD/1000\u202fm3. To our best of knowledge this is the first study that reveals the value of green water and its contribution in the production value of cereals compared to other production factors. Our findings complement previous studies regarding the crop productivity of green water. We conclude with policy implications of the study findings, highlighting the use of green water value estimations in the compilation of water accounts, as emerged in the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Water.", "Economic and food security effects of small-scale irrigation technologies in northern Ghana ": "Small-scale irrigation (SSI) technologies can be useful not only to increase crop productivity and income but also as a viable adaptation practice to climate variability. A farm simulation model (FARMSIM) and data from selected SSI technologies piloted in northern Ghana under the \u2018Feed the Future-Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation\u2019 (ILSSI) project were used to assess the economic feasibility of the SSI technologies and their potential to improve income and nutrition of smallholder farm households. Three dry season irrigated crops (onion, corchorus, amaranthus) grown under three agricultural water management regimes were analysed. Results show that adoption of the SSI technologies could increase the net farm profit by 154%\u2013608% against the baseline depending on the \u2018crop type - SSI technology\u2019 combination. Nutrition levels also improved significantly as a result of the improvements in crop yields due to irrigation and use of complementary inputs. However, the results further reveal that the options that utilize capital-intensive SSI technologies such as solar-powered water pumps to grow high value cash crops are constrained by the high investment cost. Currently, farmers tend to choose low-cost SSI technologies such as a traditional watering-cans, which generate low economic returns. Improving access to credit or alternative financing schemes could mitigate the capital constraints and enable smallholders to gain more benefits from participating in market-oriented high-value irrigated production.", "The demand for tap water quality: Survey evidence on water hardness and aesthetic quality ": "We design a survey to provide quantitative evidence about household demand for qualitative aspects of tap water supply. We focus on two characteristics that are of importance for households: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste, smell and appearance. Our survey elicits expenditures on products that improve the overall experience of these characteristics of tap water quality, and administration targets a representative sample of the population in England and Wales. For water hardness, our results show that around 14% of households employ at least one water softener device or purchase products such as softening tablets or descaling agents. For the aesthetic quality of tap water, around 39% of households report some averting behaviour, the most common being the use of filtering devices, purchase of bottled water, or addition of squash or cordial. To study how expenditures on these products vary with the level of service quality, we match household data to highly disaggregated records on regional water hardness (in mg CaCO3/l) and aesthetic quality, as measured by the regional rate of complaints to the water service supplier. Our econometric analysis suggests that households' decision to incur averting expenditures varies with service quality in a statistically and economically significant manner, providing novel evidence that households actively respond to non-health related aspects of tap water quality.", "Water quality decisions and policy for an interstate watershed ": "We develop and apply a dynamic game model with economic, hydrologic, environmental and institutional components for interdependent states to meet water quality goals either jointly or separately. States minimize costs of phosphorus pollution abatement subject to phosphorus dynamics to reach the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) water quality goal across agricultural, urban and stormwater sectors. Comparing noncooperation to cooperation helps delineate key differences in strategies to meet water quality goals. Monte Carlo simulations are used throughout the modeling process to incorporate natural variation in model parameter estimates. Nonlinear and asymmetric cost functions of pollution abatement for each state are estimated from data of each state's implementation of abatement across three sectors. The analysis helps assess how well states achieve the TMDL policy by a government-specified deadline of 2025. Variation in the abatement cost functions across states, sectors and abatement practices within each sector sets the stage to explore sharing of cost minimizing alternatives across all of these scales over time. The least cost option for each state takes into account asymmetry with cooperation across the interstate watershed to reduce total phosphorus load over the time horizon to meet the Clean Water Act goal by the 2025 deadline.", "Optimizing irrigation efficiency improvements in the Aral Sea Basin ": "Water scarcity driven by climate change, growing demand, and inefficient management of water and related infrastructure is a serious threat to livelihoods in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) of Central Asia. In recent decades, downstream water shortages have become increasingly common and inflows into the Aral Sea have become very limited. Meanwhile, water losses are enormous both at conveyance and field levels because of outdated infrastructure and the dominance of highly inefficient basin and furrow irrigation methods. Intensification and modernization of irrigation systems, while requiring investment of scarce capital resources, could thus substantially reduce non-beneficial water consumption and help in coping with increasing water scarcity. This study applies a hydro-economic model that solves for the investment in improved irrigation efficiency across the various irrigation sites in the ASB that delivers the highest economic gains. Improvement of the efficiency of irrigation canals and implementation of field efficiency investments and practices, such as drip irrigation, and alternate dry or short furrow irrigation (for rice), would substantially improve economic outcomes. Conveyance efficiency investments are particularly worthwhile in downstream regions where sandy soils are common and return flows largely feed saline lakes in tail-end depressions. Meanwhile, field-level efficiency should be fully upgraded in all rice-producing regions through the use of drip and alternate wet and dry irrigation, as well as with drip irrigation in the cotton-producing Ferghana Valley of the Syr Darya Basin. The value of these improvements increases with reduced water availability. Implementation of an optimal set of investments could increase basinwide benefits by 20% (from US$ 3.2 to 3.8 billion) under normal water availability and by 40% (from US$ 2.5 to 3.5 billion) under dry conditions (80% of normal supply).", "What is the value of bottled water? Empirical evidence from the Italian retail market ": "Bottled water has become a global business, and Italy is one of the largest producers and consumer countries in the world. However, the Italian bottled water market seems to have reached the maturity stage of its life cycle, and because competitive pressure has strongly increased in this market, producers need to revise their marketing strategies. A variety of products with different features and prices are now available on the market of bottled water, however it is unknown how the retail price of bottled water is affected by its attributes. We thus measured whether, and to what extent, the price of bottled water depends upon its extrinsic (brand, packaging, origin), and intrinsic characteristics (mineral composition). We estimated a hedonic price model using data collected via direct observation of the shelves in various Italian modern retail stores. Our results show that bottled water is highly differentiated and its retail price is mainly affected by extrinsic characteristics. On the basis of these results, several insights are provided for both practitioners and policy makers.", "The economic impacts of water information systems: A systematic review ": "Information systems can yield economic value by providing data and analyses that are useful for improving water operations and planning. Working from a simple typology of water management domains that acknowledges the coupling of supply and demand, we characterize the nature of peer-reviewed and practitioner research that considers or makes reference to the costs and benefits of water-related information. The coverage of the reviewed studies is heterogeneous across domains, sectors, analytical methods, type of information considered, and geographic regions. Studies that discuss costs and benefits of additional information relative to a counterfactual represent a minority (39%) of those reviewed. Most of these counterfactual studies use a model prediction (60%) and/or extrapolate from previous studies (34%); far fewer rely on empirical evidence (24%). Furthermore, measurement of and justification for the proposed benefits and costs \u2013 whether monetized or only quantified \u2013 remains limited. We also comment on several of the more prominent methodologies for analyzing the costs and benefits of investments in improved water information. This leads to reflections on a research agenda that would enrich what is known about the economic value of water resources information, and thereby perhaps improve decision-makers\u2019 ability to make fruitful investments in information systems. In the absence of more rigorous evidence on the contribution that specific systems make to societal well-being, decision-makers will likely remain tentative about further information investments.", "Collective Local Payments for ecosystem services: New local PES between groups, sanctions, and prior watershed trust in Mexico ": "Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs are now high in number, if not always in impact. When groups of users pay groups of service providers, establishing PES involves collective action. We study the creation of collective PES institutions, and their continuation, as group coordination. We use framed lab-in-field experiments with hydroservices users and providers within watersheds participating in Mexico's Matching Funds program in Veracruz, Yucatan and Quintana Roo states. We explore the coordination of contributions between downstream users and upstream providers, plus effects of different types of sanctions that can affect expectations for both users and providers. Both information alone and sanctions raise contributions overall, although outcomes varied by site in line with our rankings of \u2018watershed trust\u2019. For instance, monetary sanctions raise contributions in the watershed we ranked high in trust, yet initially lowered them for the lowest-trust watershed. This suggests that upstream-downstream social capital will be central to new collective local PES, while our overall trends suggest social capital can be raised by successful coordination over time.", "Water use restrictions or wastewater recycling? A Canadian willingness to pay study for reclaimed wastewater ": "Canada is the envy of many countries due to its abundant water resources: 7% of renewable fresh water with 1% of the world's population. However, pressure on this resource is growing; it is exacerbated by predictions of increasing water shortages and reduced reliability of traditional water supplies due to climate change. Canada has begun to examine the potential for the use of reclaimed wastewater to augment water supplies. The literature on reclaimed wastewater reveals a general reluctance to accept its use but that there are some situations in which consumers perceive benefits and are willing to pay for them. This paper investigates one such situation: namely, whether people are willing to pay in order to avoid summer water use restrictions via water supplies augmented with reclaimed wastewater that can be used for toilet flushing. The paper presents the first effort to examine the degree of public acceptance in Canada of supplementing existing water supplies with reclaimed wastewater. Using results from a double bounded contingent valuation survey undertaken in 2009, the paper finds an average annual WTP per household that ranges between $142 and $155, depending upon the scale of the project and upon whether respondents are concerned that other members of their community will not comply with summer water use restrictions, thereby, free riding on others. These values fall within the range of previous estimates in the literature and are somewhat higher than values obtained from Australia where there has been more adaptation to low water supply circumstances.", "The water footprint of poultry, pork and beef: A comparative study in different countries and production systems ": "Agriculture accounts for 92% of the freshwater footprint of humanity; almost one third relates to animal products. In a recent global study, Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2012) [31] show that animal products have a large water footprint (WF) relative to crop products. We use the outcomes of that study to show general trends in the WFs of poultry, pork and beef. We observe three main factors driving the WF of meat: feed conversion efficiencies (feed amount per unit of meat obtained), feed composition and feed origin. Efficiency improves from grazing to mixed to industrial systems, because animals in industrial systems get more concentrated feed, move less, are bred to grow faster and slaughtered younger. This factor contributes to a general decrease in WFs from grazing to mixed to industrial systems. The second factor is feed composition, particularly the ratio of concentrates to roughages, which increases from grazing to mixed to industrial systems. Concentrates have larger WFs than roughages, so that this factor contributes to a WF increase, especially blue and grey WFs, from grazing and mixed to industrial systems. The third factor, the feed origin, is important because water use related to feed crop growing varies across and within regions. The overall resultant WF of meat depends on the relative importance of the three main determining factors. In general, beef has a larger total WF than pork, which in turn has a larger WF than poultry, but the average global blue and grey WFs are similar across the three meat products. When we consider grazing systems, the blue and grey water footprints of poultry and pork are greater than those for beef.", "Treatment of water turbidity and bacteria by using a coagulant extracted from Plantago ovata\n             ": "A biocoagulant was successfully extracted from Plantago ovata by using an FeCl3-induced crude extract (FCE). The potential of FCE to act as a natural coagulant was tested for clarification using the turbid water of a river. Experimental tests were performed to evaluate the effects of turbidity concentration, coagulant quantity, water pH, and humic acid concentration on the coagulation of water turbidity by FCE. The maximum turbidity removal was occurred at water pH<8. At the optimum dosage of FCE, only 0.8mg/L of dissolved organic carbon was released to the treated water. An increase in the humic acid led to the promotion of the water turbidity removal. Results demonstrated that the FCE removed more than 95.6% of all initial turbidity concentrations (50\u2013300NTU). High bacteriological quality was achieved in the treated water. FCE as an eco-friendly biocoagulant was revealed to be a very efficient coagulant for removing turbidity from waters.", "Isolation, characterization and identification of microorganisms from unorganized dairy sector wastewater and sludge samples and evaluation of their biodegradability ": "In developing countries like India, the major part of the dairy sector is under the coverage area of unorganized sector, which lacks adequate treatment facility. In present investigation, the study was done to isolate most frequently occurring active strains adapted to the wastewater physical-chemical conditions and having good biodegradation potential. The 10 isolates were selected on the basis of their efficiency in reducing all the three pollution potential parameters i.e BOD, TSS and Oil and grease content. The identification of selected strains was done by 16S rRNA sequencing. The maximum reduction in BOD3 was shown by isolate no. 25 i.e 89.8% (90mg/l). Isolate no. 4 and 25 were efficient in reducing the TSS content by 88.6%. Isolate no. 27 and 45 were more efficient in reducing the oil and grease content by 88.5% and 90% respectively.", "Dye sequestration using agricultural wastes as adsorbents ": "Color is a visible pollutant and the presence of even minute amounts of coloring substance makes it undesirable due to its appearance. The removal of color from dye-bearing effluents is a major problem due to the difficulty in treating such wastewaters by conventional treatment methods. The most commonly used methods for color removal are biological oxidation and chemical precipitation. However, these processes are effective and economic only in the case where the solute concentrations are relatively high. Most industries use dyes and pigments to color their products. The presence of dyes in effluents is a major concern due to its adverse effect on various forms of life. The discharge of dyes in the environment is a matter of concern for both toxicological and esthetical reasons. It is evident from a literature survey of about 283 recently published papers that low-cost adsorbents have demonstrated outstanding removal capabilities for dye removal and the optimal equilibrium time of various dyes with different charcoal adsorbents from agricultural residues is between 4 and 5h. Maximum adsorptions of acidic dyes were obtained from the solutions with pH 8\u201310. The challenges and future prospects are discussed to provide a better framework for a safer and cleaner environment.", "Treatment of leather industrial effluents by filtration and coagulation processes ": "This study focused on effluents characterization and accessing physical and chemical treatment by filtration and coagulation processes. The analysis results of the raw effluents reveal that the effluents were yellowish-brown color, having basic pH, very high values of BOD5, COD, TDS, TSS, TS and high concentrations of Cr, Na, SO4\n                     2\u2212 and other organic and inorganic constituents. After settling and a subsequent filtration of raw tannery effluents through sand-stone, the filtered effluents were treated with various doses of FeCl3. The study observed that coagulant (FeCl3) of 150mg/L dose near neutral pH showed the best removal efficiencies for major physico-chemical parameters. The analysis results illustrate that most of the physical and chemical parameters were found well below the prescribed permissible limits for effluent discharged. The study suggests that untreated tannery effluents would be treated by a combined process consisting of settling, filtering and coagulating with FeCl3.", "Performance investigation of atmospheric water harvesting systems ": "In this paper performance and limitations of commercially-available atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) systems are experimentally investigated. A new experimental setup and test procedure, following the relevant ASHRAE and ANSI/AHRI standards, are developed to measure the water harvesting rate and input electrical power of several residential-size AWHs from different manufacturers. The setup is equipped with an environmental chamber to mimic all climatic conditions in research laboratory at Simon Fraser University and to obtain performance characteristics of AWH systems. The results show the range of water harvesting rate, energy intensity ranging from 1.02\u202fkWh/L for warm and humid to 6.23\u202fkWh/L for cold and humid climates, and climatic limitations of the conventional AWH technology that can be used as a platform for further development of higher efficiency AWH systems in future.", "Kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamic modeling of liquid phase adsorption of Rhodamine B dye onto Raphia hookerie fruit epicarp ": "Highly efficient low cost adsorbent was prepared from Raphia hookerie fruit epicarp. Characteristics of the prepared low cost adsorbent (RH) was established using scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area. RH was applied for Rhodamine B (RhB) uptake from aqueous solution. Equilibrium adsorption data were fitted using four isotherms and kinetic data tested with five kinetic models. The BET surface area obtained was 0.00351m2/g; SEM reveals large pores that could enhance the uptake of large molecules. Freundlich isotherm best described the uptake of RhB onto RH, the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (qmax) was 666.67mg/g. Pseudo second order model best described the kinetics of adsorption process. Energy of adsorption (E) obtained from D-R isotherm suggests physical adsorption. Desorption efficiency follows the order H2O>HCl>CH3COOH. Cost analysis shows that RH is about 1143 times more economical when compared with commercial activated carbon.", "Sustainable water management and improved corporate reporting in mining ": "The advent of corporate sustainability reporting and water accounting standards has resulted in increased disclosure of water use by mining companies. However, there has been limited compilation and analysis of these disclosures. To address this, we compiled a database of 8314 data points from 359 mining company reports, classified according to mining industry water accounting guidelines. The quality of disclosures is shown to have improved considerably over time. Although, opportunities still exist to improve reporting practices, such as by ensuring that all relevant water flows are reported and to explicitly state non-existent flows (e.g. discharges). Initial data analysis reveals considerable variability in water withdrawals, use efficiency and discharges between mining operations. Further work to improve industry coverage and to analyse the influence of mine specific factors such as ore processing methods and local climate will provide insights into the interactions of mining and water resources at a global scale.", "Water equity \u2013 Contrasting tourism water use with that of the local community ": "Tourism as an economic activity has grown substantially and is increasingly adding to local and seasonal pressures on water supply systems of tourist destinations around the world. Based on data from the AQUASTAT and EarthCheck tourist accommodation databases, this research analysed tourism-related water use in 21 countries and compared it with other municipal use. Tourists\u05f3 water use on a per guest night basis was found to differ substantially, with water usage being highest (up to 956l per guest night in China) and most diverse in developing countries. The disparity between tourist water use and that of locals is also greatest in low or mid-income countries. Industrialised countries, in contrast, are characterised by high tourism water efficiencies, with no apparent discrepancy in water use between tourism and non-tourism users. Implications of this research for managing potential water conflicts and the need for broader tourist destination stewardship for water resources are discussed.", "Development of iron oxide/activated carbon nanoparticle composite for the removal of Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions from aqueous solution ": "Iron oxide (Fe3O4) and iron oxide/activated carbon (Fe3O4/AC) were fabricated by co-precipitation method for the removal of Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions from aqueous solution in batch mode. These nanoparticles were characterized by BET, FTIR, XRD, SEM/TEM and VSM. The optimum conditions for the removal of ions were pH\u202f=\u202f2 for Cr(VI) and 6 for Cu(II) and Cd(II),\u00a0initial metal ion concentration\u202f=\u202f50\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121,\u00a0nanoparticle dose\u202f=\u202f50\u202fmg/10\u202fmL, temperature\u202f=\u202f25\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C, shaking speed\u202f=\u202f180\u202frpm and contact time\u202f=\u202f3\u202fh. The equilibrium data of ions sorption were well described by Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Intraparticle Diffusion model. The R2 values obtained by Langmuir model were highest by Fe3O4/AC for Cr(VI)\u202f=\u202f0.9994,Cu(II)\u202f=\u202f0.9998 and Cd(II)=\u202f0.9750. The temperature dependent study in the range of 288\u2013328\u202fK confirmed that the adsorption process was endothermic in nature. Desorption studies with 0.1\u202fM HCl stated that these nanoparticles can be regenerated effectively and can be used after four adsorption-desorption cycles without any mass loss.", "Characterization of effluent from food processing industries and stillage treatment trial with Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) and Panicum maximum (Jacq.) ": "In this study, effluents from 11 food processing industries from various sectors were characterized through analysis of physical and chemical parameters. In general, effluents pHs are between 4.07 and 7.63. Lead (Pb2+) and cadmium (Cd+) concentrations range from 0.083 to 1.025mg/l and 0.052\u20130.158mg/l respectively. The biodegradability of the effluent is very low. The principal component analysis (PCA) grouped industries according to their organic matter levels; thus, stillage, livestock, molasses and sugar refinery effluents show some similarities, as well as confectionery, oil mill, dairy and brewery effluents. Forms of nitrogen measured show low levels of nitrites (NO2\n                     \u2212), high levels of nitrates (NO3\n                     \u2212), ammonium (NH4\n                     +) and Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). Among these effluents, a treatment trial with Eichhornia crassipes and Panicum maximum was applied to stillage effluent from Fermencam distillery. The results show that Panicum maximum and Eichhornia crassipes reduce pollutant loads of Fermencam's wastewater.", "Water and detergent recovery from rinsing water in an industrial environment ": "Wash water streams coming from rinsing of equipment in a detergent production site is in many cases considered as waste. On site treatment in waste water plants is possible but typically requires advanced oxidation process (AOP) technology which uses chemicals and creates a waste sludge. A new treatment approach, based on nanofiltration, has been demonstrated at industrial scale in a detergent production site in China. Wash water could be split into a concentrate stream and water fraction. The concentrate stream contains most of the valuable surfactants and has a value to recycle. The water fraction can easily be polished by MBR to feed cooling towers. As such, this production site does not discharge any process wash water and recovers all resources out of the rinsing water: both chemicals (as surfactants) as the water.", "Application of Taguchi method for optimizing the process parameters for the removal of copper and nickel by growing Aspergillus sp. ": "In the present study, the process parameters affecting biosorption were optimized by adopting Analysis of Mean (ANOM) approach for maximizing the percentage removal of copper and nickel by growing Aspergillus sp. in batch reactor using Taguchi method. The process parameters include inoculum concentration, initial metal concentration, pH and temperature. The optimized conditions were found to be 15% v/v inoculum concentration, 50mgl\u22121 concentration of copper/nickel, pH 4 and temperature 30\u00b0C. The percentage contribution of each process parameter on the removal of copper/nickel determined using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method followed the order: concentration of copper/nickel>inoculum concentration>pH>temperature. The percentage removal of copper and nickel realized in the confirmatory experiments carried out at optimized conditions was found to be higher than that obtained in all the test runs of Taguchi design, thereby supporting the accuracy of optimization of process parameters under the given set of experimental conditions.", "Additive and additive-free treatment technologies for pulp and paper mill effluents: Advances, challenges and opportunities ": "In the present manuscript, novel effluent treatment processes for pulp and paper mill effluents are divided into two categories: a) those involving the use of chemical additives and b) those which are free of such chemicals. It is especially of high importance for pulp and paper industry to adopt the most efficient and cost-effective treatment methods. This paper critically reviews the recent studies on the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents while providing suggestions for further studies on the application of various physic-chemical and biological methods for the treatment of such complex effluents containing a number of recalcitrant pollutants.", "Hydrogeological and groundwater modeling studies to estimate the groundwater inflows into the coal Mines at different mine development stages using MODFLOW, Andhra Pradesh, India ": "The Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) is exploiting coal in the Godavari valley coal fields spread over 5.33km2 in Andhra Pradesh, India. In the area, six workable coal seams have been identified in Barakar formation by the analysis of the geologic logs of 183 bore wells. A finite difference based numerical groundwater flow model is developed with twenty conceptual layers and with a total thickness of 320m. The flow model was calibrated under steady state conditions and predicted groundwater inflows into the mine pits at different mine development stages. The groundwater budget results revealed that the mining area would receive net groundwater inflows of 5877m3\n                     day\u22121, 12,818m3\n                     day\u22121, 12,910m3\n                     day\u22121, 20,428m3\n                     day\u22121, 22,617m3\n                     day\u22121 and 14,504m3\n                     day\u22121 at six mine development stages of +124m (amsl), +93m (amsl), +64m (amsl), +41m (amsl), +0m (amsl) and \u221241m (amsl), respectively. The results of the study can be used to plan optimal groundwater pumping and the possible locations to dewater the groundwater for safe mining at different mine development stages.", "The blue and grey water footprint of construction materials: Steel, cement and glass ": "Numerous studies have been published on water footprints (WFs) of agricultural products, but much less on WFs of industrial products. The latter are often composed of various basic materials. Already the basic materials follow from a chain of processes, each with its specific water consumption (blue WF) and pollution (grey WF). We assess blue and grey WFs of five construction materials: chromium-nickel unalloyed steel, unalloyed steel, Portland cement (CEM I), Portland composite cement (CEM II/B) and soda-lime glass. Blue and grey WFs are added up along production chains, following life cycle inventory and WF accounting procedures. Steel, cement and glass have WFs dominated by grey WFs, that are 20\u2013220 times larger than the blue WFs. For steel, critical pollutants are cadmium, copper and mercury; for cement, these are mercury or cadmium; for glass, suspended solids. Blue WFs of steel, cement and glass are mostly related to electricity use.", "Assessment of activated carbon prepared from corncob by chemical activation with phosphoric acid ": "Corncob, which is the main waste from corn agricultures in Egypt, has been used as a raw material for the preparation of different activated carbons. Activated carbons (ACs) were prepared by chemical activation with concentrated H3PO4 acid; followed by pyrolysis at 400, 500 and 600\u00b0C. Different ACs have been used for the removal of methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. Batch adsorption experiments were performed as a function of initial dye concentration, contact time, adsorbent dose and pH. Adsorption data were modeled using the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. Adsorption of MB on AC1 (R\n                     2=0.9868) and AC2 (R\n                     2=0.9810) followed Langmuir model with maximum monolayer sorption capacity of 28.65 and 17.57mg/g, respectively. Adsorption onto AC3 was better fitted to Freundlich isotherm model (R\n                     2=0.9823).", "Hydrogeochemical characteristics and groundwater contamination in the rapid urban development areas of Coimbatore, India ": "The Singanallur Sub-basin is one of the major waterways and it supplies water to the Coimbatore city. Currently, it is vulnerable to pollution due to an increase of unplanned urban developments, industrial, and agricultural activities that compromise both the quality and quantity. In the present study three major hydrochemical facies were identified (mixed Ca-Mg-Cl, Ca-Cl, and Ca-HCO3). Irrigation suitability indexes are specifies that the groundwater in the areas has very high salinity hazard and low to medium alkali hazard. The mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry originally regulated by the evaporation process is dominated by reason of arid condition and anthropogenic activities existing throughout the region. The multivariate statistical analysis (Correlation analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)) indicates, most of the variations are elucidated by the anthropogenic pollutant predominantly due to population growth, industrial effluents, and irrigation water return flow. This study demonstrates enhanced information of evolution of groundwater quality by integrating hydrochemical data and multivariate statistical methods are used to understand the factors influencing contamination due to natural and anthropogenic impacts.", "Biodegradation of dairy effluent by using microbial isolates obtained from activated sludge ": "Water resources are of significant importance to human beings. The present investigation was carried out for biodegradation of dairy effluent by using selected aerobic microbial isolates and a model having layers of sawdust and activated charcoal as filtering media. Yeast isolates (DSI1) and two bacterial isolates (DSI2 and DSI3) were obtained from the dairy sludge. A mixed culture (DSI4) was prepared by taking 1:1, DSI1 and DSI3 to treat the effluent and check its efficiency. After aeration period of 48h, mixed culture of dairy sludge isolates proved to be most efficient in treatment of effluent. DSI2 showed least reduction in chemical oxygen demand. After aeration, the reduction efficiency of DSI4 was highest by 47.52% in biological oxygen demand in comparison with other isolates. DSI3 was second most effective in reduction of water parameters mainly electrical conductivity, totals solids, chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand.", "Review of methods to assess sustainability of industrial water use ": "The projected increase of industrial water demands raises the need to assess the environmental sustainability of industrial water use. Assessment methods need to use Sustainable Systems Indicators (SSIs) which relate resource use to the carrying capacity of the local environment. SSIs for water use evaluate whether water use exceeds the natural water renewal (quantity) and whether emissions remain within the assimilation capacity of ecosystems (quality). We systematically reviewed the scientific literature to show which methods are used to assess industrial water use, and of these, which methods incorporate SSIs. In total, 82 assessment methods were identified in 340 papers. The methods were assigned to five categories: Key Performance Indicators, Composite Indices, Environmental Accounting, Material and Energy Flow Analysis, and Life Cycle Analysis. In 26% of the reviewed papers, the assessment methods used SSIs. The number of papers incorporating SSIs is growing at a slower rate than the overall number of papers in the area of sustainability assessments of industrial water use. Considering the expected growth in industrial water use this poses a risk to sustainable water use. The best performing category in terms of incorporating SSIs is Material and Energy Flow Analysis (42% of papers). Papers assessing several industrial sectors in the same study incorporate SSIs more frequently (68%) than research focused on a single industry or process (20%). We discuss examples from the reviewed papers which successfully incorporate SSIs, in order to: (1) identify the elements needed to create SSIs for industrial water use, (2) aid researchers and practitioners in selecting methods which incorporate SSIs, and (3) provide a starting point for future methodological development incorporating SSIs.", "Industrial water mass balance as a tool for water management in industrial parks ": "Industry is demanding ever-greater volumes of water, while at the same time producing wastes and effluents, which in many places taint and damage the quality of this precious resource on which all life depends. This article formalizes a systematic water mass balance framework to quantify all anthropogenic and natural water flows into, water flows inside and effluents out of the industrial parks. Quantitative performance indicators are derived, including management and operation indicators. The approach makes visible large flows of water that have previously been unaccounted and ignored. In 2012\u20132014, the water consumption, which made up 59.5\u201390.2% of industrial water withdrawal, was 8.5\u201351.2% higher than wastewater generation. The approach demonstrates how the principles of water balance can help robust water accounting, monitoring, optimum operating and management in industrial parks. Furthermore, performance indicators could evolve to a useful tool for leading to more systematic analysis of the impact of industrial design and management.", "Wastewater characterization and treatment at a blueberry and carrot processing plant ": "Carrot and blueberry processing wastewaters were tested to determine total suspended solids (TSS) and organics (COD and BOD5) levels before and after wastewater treatment. Wastewater treatment by filtration through 1/8\u2033 and 1/16\u2033 reels provided no significant reduction in either TSS, COD or BOD5. Blueberry wastewater was found to have TSS concentrations of 297\u202f\u00b1\u202f85 mgL\u22121, BOD5 concentrations of 1013\u202f\u00b1\u202f292 mgL\u22121, a maximum respiration rate of 10.3\u202fmg(L\u202fh)\u22121 and COD concentrations of 1947\u202f\u00b1\u202f388 mgL\u22121 before discharge. The final effluent of carrot processing wastewater had TSS concentrations of 3030\u202f\u00b1\u202f2975 mgL\u22121, BOD5 concentrations of 2780\u202f\u00b1\u202f1848 mgL\u22121, a maximum respiration rate of 65\u202fmg(L\u202fh)\u22121 and COD concentrations of 6363\u202f\u00b1\u202f2760 mgL\u22121. After acclimatization, extended respiration tests indicated a dramatic reduction in oxygen demand was possible in post-reel wastewater, with a 75% reduction in respiration rate over 150\u202fh for blueberry wastewater and an 85% reduction in respiration rate over only 20\u202fh for the more organically-rich carrot wastewater.\n                  Bench-scale treatments of preliminary settling, alum coagulation and sedimentation, and aeration were performed on the carrot processing wastewater. Preliminary settling and coagulation-sedimentation were highly effective for TSS removal, achieving 99% reduction in TSS as compared to raw wastewater, but were not effective for organics removal, however, aeration for eight hours with activated sludge achieved 73% removal of COD and 42% removal of BOD5, indicating that biological treatment was the most promising avenue for organics removal from carrot processing wastewater.", "The water footprint of electricity in Ecuador: Technology and fuel variation indicate pathways towards water-efficient electricity mixes ": "Hydropower, biomass and thermal power plants (HPPs, BPPs and TPPs) consume water. The WF tool quantifies freshwater consumption. We calculated direct and indirect WFs of 255 Ecuadorian power plants using different technologies and fuels classified into eleven subclasses. Median WFs are largest for BPPs, followed by HPPs, while WFs of TPPs were smallest, but variation in subclasses is enormous. For HPPs, dammed HPPs have relatively large blue WFs, run-of-the-river HPPs have relatively small WFs, although they are significant to their electricity output. The cooling system is paramount for TPPs subclasses. Water-efficient cooling systems (once-through and dry-cooling) have 20% smaller WFs than wet-tower systems. Moreover, the fuel used affects the direct WF of TPPs significantly. Fuel and residue oil require water-intensive preheating; some diesel-fired TPPs use water as GHG control. BPPs are water-intensive because biomass has a large WF. Technology and fuel variation indicate pathways towards more water-efficient electricity mixes.", "Cultivation of algae consortium in a dairy farm wastewater for biodiesel production ": "Dairy farm wastewaters are potential resources for production of microalgae biofuels. A study was conducted to evaluate the capability of production of biodiesel from consortium of native microalgae culture in dairy farm treated wastewater. Native algal strains were isolated from dairy farm wastewaters collection tank (untreated wastewater) as well as from holding tank (treated wastewater). The consortium members were selected on the basis of fluorescence response after treating with Nile red reagent. Preliminary studies of two commercial and consortium of ten native strains of algae showed good growth in wastewaters. A consortium of native strains was found capable to remove more than 98% nutrients from treated wastewater. The biomass production and lipid content of consortium cultivated in treated wastewater were 153.54tha\u22121\n                     year\u22121 and 16.89%, respectively. 72.70% of algal lipid obtained from consortium could be converted into biodiesel.", "Adsorption studies of arsenic(III) removal from water by zirconium polyacrylamide hybrid material (ZrPACM-43) ": "A novel hybrid material zirconium polyacrylamide (ZrPACM-43) was synthesized by mixing aqueous solution of zirconium oxychloride and mixture of acrylamide following an environmental friendly sol\u2013gel method. The material was characterized by FTIR, XRD, TGA-DTA, and SEM-EDS. The extent of arsenic removal capacity was tested by the material by varying the solution parameters like adsorbent dose, adsorbate concentration, pH of the solution, contact time and temperature. The maximum removal efficiency of arsenic(III) was 98.22% under optimum conditions with adsorption equilibrium time of 120min. The adsorption process followed second order kinetics and adsorption data were best fitted to linearly transformed Freundlich isotherm with correlation coefficient of R\n                     2>0.999. Adsorption capacity (q\n                     o) calculated from Langmuir isotherm was found to be 41.48mgg\u22121. The thermodynamic parameter \u0394H indicates an endothermic adsorption process. The regeneration study shows that the material is regenerated by 1M alkali solution.", "Water reallocation, benefit sharing, and compensation in northeastern Mexico: A retrospective assessment of El Cuchillo Dam ": "In 1994, former President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari inaugurated El Cuchillo reservoir to transfer up to 10\u202fm3/s from the Lower San Juan River to the city of Monterrey, a major Mexican metropolis. Since 1989, three agreements have been developed to finance, construct and operate the El Cuchillo project to benefit Monterrey and compensate the farmers in the downstream irrigation district. This study reviews the agreements and lessons from implementation experience after 25\u202fyears since the project\u2019s inauguration. The El Cuchillo demonstrates that water reallocation needs to be designed and assessed within a regional perspective to identify, measure and share the costs and benefits of reallocation between rural and urban regions. This case study shows the need to compensate the region not the individual.", "Planning for sustained water-electricity resilience over the U.S.: Persistence of current water-electricity operations and long-term transformative plans ": "The electricity system relies upon the availability and predictability of water to support hydropower operations and cooling of thermoelectric plants, implying that water plays a fundamental role in power operations and that water-related stresses may have a critical effect on the electricity system. Designing for electricity system resilience to changing societal demands and environmental conditions is a complex and urgent endeavor, one that requires robust diagnosis and an articulation of interdependencies among key system components. Here we consider the argument that water may help to navigate that complexity, revealing thresholds for system change and the transformations that may be required for enduring resilience of the electricity sector. To assess this thesis, we apply a framework for understanding resilient systems following Folke et al. (2010), that is extended in this special issue (Boltz et al., 2019), by which resilience comprises three capabilities: system persistence, adaptability, and transformability. We apply this resilience diagnosis approach to the bulk electricity system of the contiguous United States, with particular attention to water-driven stressors. We provide a qualitative narrative that discusses the spectrum of resilience capabilities (persistence, adaptability, and transformability) of the water-electricity system in the United States over three scales of inter-dependencies: individual power plant, urban and grid scales.", "Water resources stewardship in an era of rapid change ": "Natural and anthropogenic changes in the earth systems impact human and environmental well-being. Water, as a critical component of social-environmental systems, has historically been managed in a way that prioritizes water supply and flood control; some side-effects include stressed ecosystems, water quality declines, and inequitable access to water. The pervasive nature of water issues, both emerging and persistent, reiterate the need for systematization of knowledge and re-envisioning of place-based planning and management of water systems. Here we develop a new conceptual framework for Water Resources Stewardship (WRS) with a focus on equitable and adaptive solutions under changing conditions. This framework organizes and fortifies existing knowledge on this topic and presents a systems-level view. A thematic analysis of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) based on published case studies is used to: (a) appraise elements of the WRS approach, and (b) identify opportunities for integration of a stewardship approach. WRS offers an adaptive and equitable approach that embraces risk-based approaches to steward water systems within an uncertain and changing environment.", "Socio-hydrological assessment of water security in canal irrigation systems: A conjoint quantitative analysis of equity and reliability ": "This paper offers a socio-hydrological assessment of water security that compares canal irrigation entitlements with water deliveries using a conjoint analysis of system reliability and equity. We develop a set of definitions and metrics to quantitatively characterize reliability and equity using newly available datasets of 10-daily canal deliveries from 2007\u20132017 in the Punjab canal command areas in the Indus Basin Irrigation System of Pakistan, where emphasis has shifted from distributing historically-defined volumetric supplies to improving irrigation efficiencies and crop yields in order to achieve greater aggregate water and food security. Our analysis reveals stagnation and oscillation over time in system-level equity and reliability. We reflect on the potential to positively affect canal irrigation performance and water security through a socio-hydrological approach.", "ASPEN PLUS simulation model for CO2 removal with MEA: Validation of desorption model with experimental data ": "The chemical absorption process has been extensively studied as one of the main carbon capture and separation technologies. This process comprises two stages: The absorption of CO2 into the solvent and the desorption, to regenerate the solvent and produce the high concentrated CO2 gas.\n                  Validated simulation models are essential for the scale-up of the chemical absorption process and they are typically validated using only data from one pilot plant. In this work, a simulation model of the desorption column built in ASPEN PLUS v8.6 was validated using four experimental pilot campaigns using 30wt% MEA. The desorbers in the different campaigns varied in the diameters, structured packing heights and packing types.\n                  A good agreement is observed between experimental data and the simulation results of the chemical absorption process presented here. The model shows an AARD (average absolute relative deviation) of 9.2% for the CO2 stripped (kg/h) for the tested 78 experimental runs. The simulated temperatures of the liquid flux leaving the reboiler show a deviation of 3.3% compared with the experimental data. The deviations on the estimation of the CO2 stripped show some dependency on the CO2 loading in the rich amine flux entering the desorber. However, the deviations are independent on the temperature of the rich amine.", "Prevalence of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in a wastewater effluent-receiving river in the Netherlands ": "Antibiotics are being used intensively for humans and livestock worldwide and have led to the presence of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as a point source for ARB&Gs, and water catchments consequently are potential receptors of ARB&Gs. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of antibiotics (macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines), ARGs (ermB, sul1, sul2, tetW), and class 1 integron (targeting the integrase gene), in a Dutch river that receives wastewater treatment plant effluent. Sediment and water samples were collected during one year along the river. The WWTP significantly increased the amounts of antibiotics and ARGs in the river as compared to the upstream samples, of which the antibiotics decreased once they entered the river. ARGs were persistent in the water and sediment from the WWTP effluent discharge point until 20\u202fkm downstream. This study provides insight in the prevalence of antibiotics and ARGs in a wastewater effluent-receiving river system in the Netherlands. Even though human antibiotic usage is low in the Netherlands, antibiotics, residues of antibiotics, and ARGs are detected in the river surface water-sediment system, which shows that a river has the potential to act as a reservoir of ARGs.", "Recent advances in photocatalysis for environmental applications ": "Advanced Oxidation technologies (AOTs) are gaining attention as an effective waste water treatment methodology capable of degrading diverse spectrum of recalcitrant organic contaminants and microbes. Undoubtedly, photocatalysis is a promising AOT to alleviate the problem of water pollution. Despite recent research into other photocatalysts (e.g. ZnO, ZnS, Semiconductor-Graphene composites, perovskites, MoS2, WO3 and Fe2O3), titanium dioxide (TiO2) remains the most popular photocatalyst due to its low cost, nontoxicity and high oxidising ability. Moreover, titania photocatalysts can easily be immobilized on various surfaces and be scaled up for large scale water treatment. The current review aims to highlight recent advancements in photocatalytic AOTs with main emphasis on TiO2 photocatalysis. This review also discusses the use of TiO2 photocatalysis for water and waste treatment, treating contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), pesticides, endocrine disrupters (EDs) and bacteria using both UV and visible light irradiations. It was concluded that with efficient photoreactor configuration and further studies on the photocatalyst regeneration, TiO2 photocatalysis is a viable option for the reclamation of agricultural/irrigational waste water.

Consequently, existence of dye effluent in environmental water bodies is becoming a growing concern to environmentalists and civilians. A long term sustainable and efficient dye effluent treatment method should be established to eliminate this issue. Dye wastewater should be treated first before release to minimize its negative impacts towards the environment and living things. However, due to lack of information on efficient dye removal methods, it is difficult to decide on a single technique that resolves the prevailing dye effluent issue. Therefore, this paper reviews existing research papers on various biological, chemical and physical dye removal methods to find its efficiency through percentage of dye removal. Although there are numerous existing tried and tested methods to accomplish dye removal, most of them have a common disadvantage which is the generation of secondary pollution to the environment. This paper highlights enzyme degradation (biological) and adsorption (physical) dye removal as these are known as one of the most efficient dye removal techniques these days. This paper also suggests the usage of a combined adsorbent as it is envisioned that this technique has better efficiency and is able to remove dyes at a faster rate.", "Removal of cadmium from wastewaters with low-cost adsorbents ": "Instead of using commercial activated carbon or ion exchange resins, researchers have worked on inexpensive materials, such as wastes from industry and agricultural operations due to their outstanding adsorption behavior toward heavy metal ions. Low-cost adsorbents are easily and locally available in large quantities. The modification of these materials could considerably increase their sorption capacity. In this review, the technical feasibility of various low-cost adsorbents for removal of Cd(II) from wastewaters has been discussed. Due to widespread cadmium contamination and its toxicity, there is considerable interest to remove it before discharge into wastewater streams. Several factors affecting an adsorption process such as pH, contact time as well as the reported maximum adsorption capacity values are summarized. The subsequent regeneration and reuse of adsorbents has been given considerable attention and some adsorption studies using real wastewater samples were also discussed.", "A review on Fenton-like processes for organic wastewater treatment ": "Fenton-like processes have been studied widely in recent years and are considered promising for organic wastewater treatment.

Especially, the water pollution is growing rapidly due to the wastewater discharge from the industries. The only way to find the new water resource is the reuse of treated wastewater. Several remediation technologies are available which provides a convenience to reuse the reclaimed wastewater. Heavy metals like Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd, Hg, etc. contributes various environmental problems based on their toxicity. These toxic metals are exposed to human and environment, the accumulation of ions takes place which causes serious health and environmental hazards. Hence, it is a major concern in the environment. Due to this concern, the significance of developing technology for removing heavy metals has been increased. This paper contributes the outline of new literature with two objectives. First, it provides the sketch about treatment technologies followed by their heavy metal capture capacity from industrial effluent.

However, the issue associated with traditional biodiesel production is the expensive production cost on the industrial scale, mainly contributed by the raw materials. Therefore, catalyst plays an important role with the purpose to speed up the overall biodiesel production rate and minimizing the production cost. Over the course, numerous researches have been done on various types of catalyst in biodiesel production. Henceforth, this review comprises of a comprehensive overview of biodiesel production by discussing the latest trends, that utilizes biomass waste-derived biochar catalyst. Apart from that, the focus of this review will be on magnetic catalyst (derived from both biomass and non-biomass) used in biodiesel synthesis whereby the magnetic catalyst synthesis method and characterisation, as well as compilation of experimental data of different literatures on using magnetic catalyst will be included in the framework of this paper. Moreover, the magnetic catalyst reusability studies are also highlighted in this review. Application of biomass-based magnetic catalyst in biodiesel production may be one of the solutions to overcome the catalyst separation issue and to further the development of economically feasible biodiesel industry and ultimately, transforming the current energy options into a greener and more sustainable sources of energy.", "The mechanism of the spontaneous detonation of ammonium nitrate in reactive grounds ": "The mechanism of the decomposition of ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and of ammonium nitrate (AN) emulsions has been investigated. The formation of NO gas bubbles at the end of an induction period was observed, which led to the evolution of brown NO2 gas on contact with air. Inhibition of the decomposition reaction could be achieved by reducing the NO concentration in the gas phase, with inhibitors not in physical contact with the reaction mixture. NO adsorbing clay minerals (hydrotalcite) were effective inhibitors, indicating multiple mechanisms of inhibition. A central role is assigned to nitrous acid (HNO2): sequestering NO prevents its formation, base inhibitors keep it in the non-reactive form of the nitrite ion (pKa of HNO2\n                     \u223c3), and urea in acidic conditions decomposes it to harmless N2. Our results have implications in industries where NOx emissions can cause significant environmental problems for both aquatic and marine life as well as for human health.", "A review on Fenton and improvements to the Fenton process for wastewater treatment ": "The increase in the disposal of refractory organics demands for newer technologies for the complete mineralization of these wastewaters. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) constitute a promising technology for the treatment of such wastewaters and this study presents a general review on such processes developed to decolorize and/or degrade organic pollutants. Fundamentals and main applications of typical methods such as Fenton, electro-Fenton, photo-Fenton, sono-Fenton, sono-photo-Fenton, sono-electro-Fenton and photo-electro-Fenton are discussed. This review also highlights the application of nano-zero valent iron in treating refractory compounds.", "Trends in CO2 conversion and utilization: A review from process systems perspective ": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) community has been struggling over the past few decades to demonstrate the economic feasibility of CO2 sequestration. Nevertheless, in practice, it has only proven feasible under conditions with a market for the recovered CO2, such as in the beverage industry or enhanced oil/gas recovery. The research community and industry are progressively converging to a conclusion that CO2 sequestration has severe limitations for the value proposition. Alternatively, creating diverse demand markets and revenue streams for the recovered almost-pure CO2 may prevail over CO2 sequestration option and improve the economic feasibility of this climate change mitigation approach. As such, research in the carbon capture and management field is seen to be shifting towards CO2 utilization, directly and indirectly, in energy and chemical industries.\n                  In this paper, we have critically reviewed the literature on carbon capture, conversion, and utilization routes and assessed the progress in the research and developments in this direction. Both physical and chemical CO2 utilization pathways are studied and the principles of key routes are identified. The literature is also probed in addressing the process integration scenarios and the performance assessment benchmarks.", "Fabrication of advance magnetic carbon nano-materials and their potential applications: A review ": "Novel magnetic carbon nano-materials have attracted great interest in recent years due to their potential applications in many areas that exploit the combined advantage of magnetic with nano-scale properties. These materials are suitable for the catalysis, adsorption, carbon capture, energy and hydrogen storage, drug delivery, bio-sensing and cancer detection.

The variety of applications of TiO2 as a photocatalyst has been taken place because of low operating temperature, biologically inert nature, low energy consumption, water insolubility, ease availability and photoactivity, less toxicity, high chemical stability, suitable flat band potential, narrow band gap and environmentally benign. The successful and efficient application of photocatalysis depends on quality of photocatalyst, nature of pollutants, and source of light, which should be in close contact with each other. The TiO2 photocatalyst is used for the effluent treatment of textile wastewater in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Heterogeneous UV-TiO2 photocatalysis is capable to remove organic pollutants from textile wastewater, which has been widely studied and the technology also being commercialized in many developing countries in the world. This review focuses on the mechanism of UV-TiO2 photocatalysis, modification of TiO2 photocatalyst, and application of doping and co-doping in order to improve the photocatalytic activity in wastewater treatment.

The most important parameters to evaluate the performance of this type of fuel cells are the pollutant degradation efficiency and the maximum power density generated. The effect of external and internal fuel cell parameters on the pollutant degradation efficiency and the maximum power density has been extensively discussed.", "Development of peroxidase enzyme immobilized magnetic nanoparticles for bioremediation of textile wastewater dye ": "Peroxidase enzyme plays a major role in the degradation of phenolic compounds such as azo dyes. This enzyme was isolated and purified from the bioremediation products of textile wastewater containing direct green azo dye in a UFC/CSA prototype bioreactor. To improve the enzyme stability, efficiency and recyclability, peroxidase was immobilized on Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles produced and modified by co-precipitation using glutaraldehyde. The immobilized enzyme was characterized by transmission electron microscopy analysis and examined against different pH as well as storage time and temperatures. The MNPs-immobilized peroxidise was remarkable stable towards temperature and pH perturbations, compared to the free enzyme form. Moreover, the immobilized peroxidase maintained its full activity upon storage at 4 and 25\u2009\u00b0C for 90 days, and upon recycling for up to 100 cycles. Finally, the MNPs-immobilized peroxidase was successfully employed to decolorize dyes of different chemical natures in a lab scale bioreactor. Hence, we believe that the immobilized peroxidase on magnetic nanoparticles reported in this work can be potentially used in various industrial and environmental applications.", "Potential and challenges of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in dye wastewater treatment: A review ": "Enzymes are known to catalyze reactions at high efficiency, operate at milder conditions and are biodegradable. Due to enzyme limitations such as sensitivity to environmental conditions, enzyme immobilization is often used. The commonly employed immobilization methods include adsorption, entrapment, covalent attachment and cross-linking. Many research works have now focused on the immobilization of enzymes on nanoscale support due to the higher surface area to volume ratio, effective enzyme loading, significantly enhanced mass transfer efficiency and minimization of diffusional problems. The application of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in the treatment of dye wastewater is thus, of high interest. Therefore, this paper has critically reviewed (1) the current technologies available for dye wastewater treatment; (2) different methods utilized for enzyme immobilization; and (3) the application and performance of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology for dye wastewater treatment. We identified that there is high potential for enzyme incorporated nanotechnology to be implemented in dye wastewater treatment due to the high decolorization performance (e.g. laccase immobilized on Fe3O4/SiO2 nanoparticles achieved 99% decolorization of Procion Red MX-5B in 20\u202fmin). We have also identified the key challenges faced by enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in dye wastewater treatment that includes: (i) realization of lab scale experiments to industrial applications; (ii) lack of understanding of enzymes incorporated nanotechnology; (iii) recovery of immobilized enzyme; (iv) synthesis of hybrid nanoflowers; and (v) sustainability of the nanomaterials used.", "Acid mine drainage: Challenges and opportunities ": "Acid mine drainage (AMD) or acid rock drainage (ARD) is considered as one of the main pollutants of water in many countries that have historic or current mining activities. Its generation, release, mobility, and attenuation involves complex processes governed by a combination of physical, chemical, and biological factors. In general, AMD is produced by the oxidative dissolution of sulphide minerals. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of AMD. It critically analyses the work performed in recent years on its occurrence, effects (on human health, plant life and aquatic species), and summarizes the remediation approaches taken so far to overcome the problem of AMD. The challenges faced in tackling the remediation of AMD have also been considered. Commercially developed projects that are either in operation, being piloted or under evaluation have also been discussed. Finally, the paper speculates on future directions or opportunities that deserve exploration.", "Degradation of amoxicillin by Fenton and Fenton-integrated hybrid oxidation processes ": "The present study aims to investigate the degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) using the Fenton process and hybrid Fenton-like processes such as photo-Fenton, solar photo-Fenton, sono-Fenton, and sono-photo-Fenton. The effect of ferrous ions (Fe2+), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and pH was evaluated. Complete degradation was achieved within 12\u2009min of reaction time under the optimized conditions of Fe2+- 30\u2009mg/l, H2O2 \u2013 375\u2009mg/l, and pH\u2009\u2013\u20093.0 during Fenton\u2019s process. Efficiency towards degradation of AMX was enhanced when the Fenton\u2019s process was coupled with UV- light illumination, solar light illumination, and UV light-Ultrasound treatment. Complete degradation was observed within 3.5\u2009min and 9\u2009min during the photo-Fenton and solar photo-Fenton process, respectively. The sono-Fenton process takes a longer time to degrade AMX than other processes while sono-photo-Fenton process degrades AMX within 6\u2009min. The reason for a reduced rate of degradation of AMX in the sono-Fenton process may be attributed to the competition of ultrasound and Fenton for H2O2, which ultimately decreases Fenton reagent in the process. The study concluded that the Fenton process coupled with other UV/solar light is more efficient than the stand-alone Fenton process towards degradation of AMX.", "\n               Shorea robusta derived activated carbon decorated with manganese dioxide hybrid composite for improved capacitive behaviors ": "Shorea robusta derived activated carbon decorated with MnO2 was successfully prepared. Thus prepared activated carbon was characterized by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)/Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS).

Electrochemical characterization was also performed by three-electrode system where carbon electrode was used as working electrode, platinum plate was used as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode was used as a reference electrode. The experiments were performed in 6\u202fM aqueous KOH using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge\u2013Discharge (GCD) and Impendance Spectroscopy (EIS).

However, when applied in slurry form, agglomeration of nanoparticle will lead to serious decrease in photocatalytic performance due to hinderance effect. By combining the photocatalyst and adsorbents, which is designated as integrated photocatalyst adsorbent (IPCA), an adsorbent material which also degrades toxic organic compounds in the presence of UV/visible light irradiation could be produced. The compound does not only preserve all the interesting characteristics of both individual components, but also overcomes serious drawbacks, such as low absorptivity, rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and hinderance effect of photocatalyst when applied in slurry form. There are several criteria that must be obeyed by the absorbent material used such as high absorption capacity to target compound, reasonable transparency to UV\u2013vis light, high surface area, inhibition of photocatalyst leaching and good stability with dispersing solvent. In this review article, the authors presented an overview on the application of photocatalyst, adsorbents and integrated photocatalyst adsorbents for wastewater treatment. Moreover, the discussions were also focused on the major adsorbent which has been integrated with photocatalyst such as carbon, clays, zeolite matrix materials and others. Additionally, the mechanisms of the adsorption of emerging organic contaminants with adsorbents in IPCA were also discussed to clearly understand the possible interactions between organic contaminants and IPCA. Outlook on IPCA study were also discussed to further broaden the prospective of this technology.", "Green synthesis of silver doped nano metal oxides of zinc & copper for antibacterial properties, adsorption, catalytic hydrogenation & photodegradation of aromatics ": "Silver doped copper and zinc nano metal oxides were synthesized in the presence of Sida rhombifolia leaf extract by self propagating sol-gel autocombustion process. X-ray diffraction studies indicated the formation of wurtzite hexagonal phase for ZnO, monoclinic for CuO and FCC structure for silver nanocomposites. The surface morphology of nanoparticles were studied using FESEM. FTIR studies confirmed the presence of silver & M\u2013O bonds. UV\u2013vis DRS studies revealed that silver doping reduced the band-gap energy which overcomes fast recombination rate of electron-hole pairs of the nanoparticles. TGA studies indicated enhanced thermal stability of doped nanocomposites. Hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with NaBH4 showed that Ag/ZnO & Ag/CuO exhibited greater photoreduction capacity than undoped ZnO & CuO. ZnO, Ag/ZnO, CuO & Ag/CuO nanocomposites have antagonistic effect on the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus with greater inhibition zones. Ag/CuO NPs exhibited the highest sensitivity against various bacterial strains with MIC below 1\u2009mg. Ag/CuO nanorods showed excellent adsorption properties with high removal capacity of MG of about 90%. Kinetic, thermodynamic and equilibrium studies on adsorption of MG onto Ag/CuO nanorods was carried out. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO and Ag/ZnO nanocomposites was investigated by studying the degradation of methylene blue & malachite green under UV irradiation. Ag/ZnO exhibited better photodegradation efficiency of MG & MB and follows pseudo first order kinetic model. Thus the simple, low-cost and eco-friendly herbal synthesis of oxides of silver doped zinc & copper provides nanocomposites with multifunctional applications.", "Towards industrial implementation of Electro-Fenton and derived technologies for wastewater treatment: A review ": "This is an updated critical review of the advances towards the full exploitation of diverse Electro-Fenton technologies for the decontamination of real effluents at industrial scale. The main relevant innovations spanning almost three decades are analyzed from a historical perspective. Electro-Fenton, Photoelectro-Fenton, Peroxi-coagulation, Sonoelectro-Fenton and related methods are assessed. Economic aspects and engineering challenges that should be overcome to reach the title goal, such as efficient cathodes for H2O2 electrogeneration, heterogeneous catalysis, the pH issue, and the iron sludge problem are particularly highlighted. A special section is devoted to examining the R&D works on actual wastewaters.

Finally, suggestions for further development at a large scale, depending on wastewater characteristics, are summarized.", "Electrochemical degradation of triclosan in aqueous solution. A study of the performance of an electro-Fenton reactor ": "The electro-Fenton degradation of Triclosan in aqueous solution was studied using a cylindrical reactor in which polarized carbon cloth electrodes and a cation exchange resin were employed. Using a factorial design of experiments approach, the effect of four variables (considering two levels for each one), was measured on four response parameters that reflect the electrooxidation efficiency of the electrochemical reactor. The results revealed that in all cases triclosan degradation was very efficient (above 95%) and that while there is a reasonable effect of all variables and their interactions, the one with the strongest influence on the process is the nature and magnitude of the ionic strength of the electrolytic solution. In this way, while the presence of a buffer species in this solution can keep the pH in a value that affects the generation of \u2022OH radicals from the Fenton mixture, a high ionic strength solution can promote the elimination of Fe ionic species from the reactor by decreasing resin Fe retention due to competition effects of other ions for the binding sites of the substrate. HPLC experiments of the effluent solutions, also revealed that the degradation by-products of triclosan were dependent on the nature and ionic strength of the electrolytic solution in the electro-Fenton process under study. Finally, comparison of the different operation modes, also suggested that electro-adsorption of Fe cationic species in the negatively polarized cathode surface, is the main factor that controls Fe ion retention within the reactor.", "Pre-treatment and anaerobic digestion of food waste for high rate methane production \u2013 A review ": "Food waste with high decomposition potential can be successfully digested anaerobically for the production of biogas. As the fossil-fuel reserves decline anaerobic digestion can be a better alternative as a renewable energy source. The byproducts such as biogas with 50\u201360% methane content can be efficiently used for electricity production and the final digested sludge as a fertilizer. Even though anaerobic digestion is a proven technology, still there exist some technical difficulties (organic loading rate, solid retention time, biogas composition, specific gas production) and scientific understandings (carbon to nitrogen ratio, volatile fatty acids production, pH variation, nutrient concentration) in operating reactors for solid organic wastes. First the paper gives an overview of certain fundamental aspects of anaerobic digestion considered important for the digestion of food waste and its biochemical reactions. Then it describes food waste as the substrate for anaerobic digestion and its optimal conditions for the increased activity of biogas production. Finally it has been reviewed about the performance of the different pre-treatment methods and anaerobic reactor configurations in the digestion of food waste for increasing methane content in the biogas.", "Flocculation: An effective way to harvest microalgae for biodiesel production ": "Microalgae are considered the most suitable feedstock for biodiesel production due to their higher areal productivity and lipid content. The economical production of biofuels from microalgae is important. This paper is a review of different techniques used for flocculating microalgae such as use of inorganic salts, organic salts, bioflocculants, autoflocculation and electrolytic flocculation for harvesting microalgae for biodiesel production. It was found that the usage of natural flocculants for harvesting microalgae eliminates the toxicity of biomass harvested but the cost of flocculant makes it uneconomical for large scale applications. The economic method of harvesting large quantity of microalgae still requires further research and development."}
