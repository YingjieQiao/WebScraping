1. Catalyst: for water splitting (to produce H2 for energy)
2. perovskite soda cell: absorb sunlight and convert them into energy. Pb2+ is toxic. Minimize the toxicity but preserve the energy conversion efficiency. Passivation material
3. Florent dye: toxicity. Find a dye that is not so toxic to be used for medicals. Make them more photostable. Selectivity: go into cancer cells/ nerve cells/virus/malaria...
