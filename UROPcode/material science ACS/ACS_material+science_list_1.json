["We report on a reversible structural phase transition of a two-dimensional system that can be locally induced by an external electric field. Two different structural configurations may coexist within a CO monolayer on Cu(111). The balance between the two phases can be shifted by an external electric field, causing the domain boundaries to move, increasing the area of the favored phase controllable both in location and size. If the field is further enhanced new domains nucleate. The arrangement of the CO molecules on the Cu surface is observed in real time and real space with atomic resolution while the electric field driving the phase transition is easily varied over a broad range. Together with the well-known molecular manipulation of CO adlayers, our findings open exciting prospects for combining spontaneous long-range order with man-made CO structures such as \u201cmolecule cascades\u201d or \u201cmolecular graphene\u201d. Our new manipulation mode permits us to bridge the gap between fundamental concepts and the fabrication of arbitrary atomic patterns in large scale, by providing unprecedented insight into the physics of structural phase transitions on the atomic scale.", "The importance of green syntheses and sustainable polymers is highlighted in a new experiment developed for incorporation into the introductory organic chemistry laboratory curriculum. \u03b4-Decalactone, a naturally occurring cyclic ester used by the food and flavor industry for its coconut fragrance and taste, is polymerized under acidic conditions with a diol initiator. The solvent-free, room-temperature reaction conditions result in a viscous homopolymer from which the catalyst is easily removed. Subsequent chain extension of this homopolymer with the renewable monomer l-lactide, followed by purification, isolation, and annealing in an aluminum pan, affords a block copolymer product as a transparent, flexible film. Well-resolved resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum of the individual polymer repeat units facilitate quantitative analysis of polymer composition and molecular weight determination. This experiment introduces students to structures and fundamental concepts of polymer chemistry and exemplifies modern advances in sustainable materials.", "The fabrication of mechanically robust polymeric materials capable of self-healing and recycling remains challenging because the mobility of polymer chains in such polymers is very limited. In this work, mechanically robust supramolecular thermosets capable of healing physical damages and recycling under mild conditions are fabricated by trimerization of bi-(ortho-aminomethyl-phenylboronic acid)- and tri-(ortho-aminomethyl-phenylboronic acid)-terminated poly(propylene glycol) oligomers (denoted as Bi-PBA-PPG and Tri-PBA-PPG, respectively). The resultant supramolecular thermosets are cross-linked by dynamic covalent bonds of nitrogen-coordinated boroxines. The mechanical properties of the supramolecular thermosets can be systematically tailored by varying the ratios between Tri-PBA-PPG and Bi-PBA-PPG, which changes the cross-linking density of nitrogen-coordinated boroxines and the topology of the supramolecular thermosets. The mechanically strongest supramolecular thermosets with a molar ratio of Tri-PBA-PPG to Bi-PBA-PPG being 1:2 have a glass transition temperature of \u223c36 \u00b0C, a tensile strength of \u223c31.96 MPa, and a Young\u2019s modulus of \u223c298.5 MPa. The high reversibility of nitrogen-coordinated boroxines and the flexibility of poly(propylene glycol) chains enable the supramolecular thermosets with the strongest mechanical strength to be highly efficiently healed at 55 \u00b0C and recycled under a pressure of 4 MPa at 60 \u00b0C to regain their original mechanical strength and integrity.", "Cylindrical vector beams, such as radially or azimuthally polarized doughnut beams, are combined with topography studies of pentacene thin films, allowing us to correlate Raman spectroscopy with intermolecular interactions depending on the particular pentacene polymorph. Polarization-dependent Raman spectra of the C\u2013H bending vibrations are resolved layer by layer within a thin film of \u223c20 nm thickness. The variation of the Raman peak positions indicates changes in the molecular orientation and in the local environment at different heights of the pentacene film. With the assistance of a theoretical model based on harmonic oscillator and perturbation theory, our method reveals the local structural order and the polymorph at different locations within the same pentacene thin film, depending mainly on its thickness. In good agreement with the crystallographic structures reported in the literature, our observations demonstrate that the first few monolayers grown in a structure are closer to the thin-film phase, but for larger film thicknesses, the morphology evolves toward the crystal-bulk phase with a larger tilting angle of the pentacene molecules against the substrate normal.", "A laboratory exercise for the construction of a dye-sensitized solar cell using everyday household and benign products has been developed.

Nevertheless, this method was usually limited to small substrates, since PLD deposition on large substrate areas results in severe lateral inhomogeneity. A few technical solutions for this problem have been suggested, including the use of different designs of masks, which were meant to prevent inhomogeneity in the thickness, density, and oxidation state of a layer, while only the composition is allowed to be changed. In this study, a possible way to take advantage of the large scale deposition inhomogeneity is demonstrated, choosing an iron oxide PLD-deposited library with continuous compositional spread (CCS) as a model system. An Fe2O3\u2013Nb2O5 library was fabricated using PLD, without any mask between the targets and the substrate. The library was measured using high-throughput scanners for electrical, structural, and optical properties. A decrease in electrical resistivity that is several orders of magnitude lower than pure \u03b1-Fe2O3 was achieved at \u223c20% Nb\u2013O (measured at 47 and 267 \u00b0C) but only at points that are distanced from the center of the PLD plasma plume. Using hierarchical clustering analysis, we show that the PLD inhomogeneity can be used as an additional degree of freedom, helping, in this case, to achieve iron oxide with much lower resistivity.", "Conspectus\nThe notion that light and matter states can be hybridized the way s and p orbitals are mixed is a concept that is not familiar to most chemists and material scientists. Yet it has much potential for molecular and material sciences that is just beginning to be explored. For instance, it has already been demonstrated that the rate and yield of chemical reactions can be modified and that the conductivity of organic semiconductors and nonradiative energy transfer can be enhanced through the hybridization of electronic transitions. The hybridization is not limited to electronic transitions; it can be applied for instance to vibrational transitions to selectively perturb a given bond, opening new possibilities to change the chemical reactivity landscape and to use it as a tool in (bio)molecular science and spectroscopy. Such results are not only the consequence of the new eigenstates and energies generated by the hybridization. The hybrid light\u2013matter states also have unusual properties: they can be delocalized over a very large number of molecules (up to ca. 105), and they become dispersive or momentum-sensitive. Importantly, the hybridization occurs even in the absence of light because it is the zero-point energies of the molecular and optical transitions that generate the new light\u2013matter states. The present work is not a review but rather an Account from the author\u2019s point of view that first introduces the reader to the underlying concepts and details of the features of hybrid light\u2013matter states. It is shown that light\u2013matter hybridization is quite easy to achieve: all that is needed is to place molecules or a material in a resonant optical cavity (e.g., between two parallel mirrors) under the right conditions. For vibrational strong coupling, microfluidic IR cells can be used to study the consequences for chemistry in the liquid phase. Examples of modified properties are given to demonstrate the full potential for the molecular and material sciences. Finally an outlook of future directions for this emerging subject is given.", 0, "Here we investigate the impact of four different metal back contacts on the photovoltaic (PV) performance of Co3O4 thin film all-oxide photovoltaic cells. A combinatorial TiO2|Co3O4 heterojunction thin film device library was made with thickness gradients for both metal oxide layers. Grids of four different metal back contacts were then deposited on top of these layers. A significant effect of the metal back contacts on the final photoconversion performance has been observed by combinatorial PV measurements. We analyze these results via advanced numerical simulations and different scenarios in order to explain the recombination mechanisms at the different back contacts. We conclude that the nature of the back contact material controls the density of surface states and, therefore, the undesirable surface recombination at the absorber\u2013back contact interface.", 0, "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics lays out the machinery of quantum mechanics for the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student.

To achieve this result, rational understanding of the science that underlies food physical chemistry is of paramount importance. In this contribution, the process of spherification is dissected for the first time at the atomic level by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that a thin membrane consisting of intertwined alginate chains forms in an aqueous solution containing calcium ions, thereby encapsulating in a sphere the aliment in its liquid state. They also show why the polysaccharide chains will not cohere into such a membrane in a solution of sodium ions. Analysis of the trajectories reveals the emergence of so-called egg-box spatial arrangements, which connect the alginate chains by means of repeated chelation of one calcium ion by two carboxylate groups. Free-energy calculations delineating the formation of these egg-box structures further illuminate the remarkable stability of such tridimensional organizations, which ensures at room temperature the spontaneous growth of the polysaccharide membrane. Spherification has been also examined for liquid aliments of different nature, modeled by charged, hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. The membrane-encapsulated food is shaped into robust and durable spheres, irrespective of the liquid core material. By reconciling the views of spherification at small and large scales, the present study lays the groundwork for the rational design of innovative cooking techniques relevant to avant-garde cuisine.", "Vertical composition gradients of ternary alloy thin films find applications in numerous device structures. Up to now such gradients along the growth direction have not been realized by standard pulsed laser deposition (PLD) systems. In this study, we propose an approach based on a single elliptically segmented PLD target suited for the epitaxial growth of vertically graded layers. The composition of the thin films can be varied by a simple adjustment of the position of the PLD laser spot on the target surface. We demonstrate this principle for the MgxZn1\u2013xO alloy system. Such vertically composition-graded MgxZn1\u2013xO thin films exhibit high optical quality and a well-defined Mg-content for each layer. No signs of interdiffusion of Mg-atoms between the layers have been found. Further, this method is capable to deposit homogeneous thin films with any desired, well-defined cation composition having the same high optical and structural quality as films grown by conventional PLD.", 0, "Material science aspects of synthetic polymeric membranes are presented in this survey.

After this first burst of research activity, challenging the boundaries of CuAAC in terms of attainable polymer constructs, ongoing method development, and implementation, in response to the need for metal-free alternatives, resulted in a valuable toolbox of \u201cclick\u201d-inspired conjugation methods.

While some embrittlement mechanisms have been proposed (especially for Fe), the behavior of dissolved hydrogen and impact on material properties is not fully understood in many systems relevant to hydrogen technologies. Here, hydrogen binding in pure Pd and alloys of Pd with Ag and Au was examined at a fundamental level from first principles in an attempt to elucidate how hydrogen-induced failure can be reduced in Pd alloys relevant to hydrogen production technologies. We show that PdAg and PdAu alloys (where the alloying metal is under 25%) likely suppress hydrogen-induced mechanical failure due to their reduced hydrogen solubility relative to pure Pd. This conclusion is based on our findings that alloying leads to higher vacancy stabilization and lower elastic constants upon hydrogen dissolution than for pure Pd but to unfavorable hydrogen dissolution beyond 25 at. %. The lowering of hydrogen solubility is strongly related to the combination of a lowering of the overall metal d-band center through alloy incorporation as well as changes to the metal Pauli repulsion factor, which is herein related to the metal matrix coupling element. Additionally, hydrogen loading and unloading were sequentially interrogated to mimic stress in storage materials. We find that permanent plastic deformation to the system is pronounced for alloyed systems, which in some cases made subsequent loading more favorable.", 0, "Abstracts are being accepted for the 6th Annual Practical Applications of NMR in Industry Conference (PANIC), which is being organized by the American Chemical Society.

The primary amine is a key functional group and one of the most important nucleophiles and bases used in all of synthetic chemistry. Therefore, tremendous interest in the synthesis of molecules containing primary amines and strategies to devise chemical reactions to react with primary amines has been at the core of chemical research. In particular, primary amines are a ubiquitous functional group found in biological systems as free amino acids, as key side chain lysines in proteins, and in signaling molecules and metabolites and are also present in many natural product classes. Due to its abundance, the primary amine is the most convenient functional group handle in molecules for ligation to other molecules for a broad range of applications that impact all scientific fields. Because of the primary amine\u2019s central importance in synthetic chemistry, acid\u2013base chemistry, redox chemistry, and biology, many methods have been developed to efficiently react with primary amines, including activated carboxylic acids, isothiocyanates, Michael addition type systems, and reaction with ketones or aldehydes followed by in situ reductive amination. Herein, we introduce a new traceless, high-yield, fast click-chemistry method based on the rapid and efficient trapping of amine groups via a functionalized dialdehyde group. The click reaction occurs in mild conditions in organic solvents or aqueous media and proceeds in high yield, and the starting dialdehyde reagent and resulting dialdehyde click conjugates are stable. Moreover, no catalyst or dialdehyde-activating group is required, and the only byproduct is water. The initial dialdehyde and the resulting conjugate are both straightforward to characterize, and the reaction proceeds with high atom economy. To demonstrate the broad scope of this new click-conjugation strategy, we designed a straightforward scheme to synthesize a suite of dialdehyde reagents.

Particular emphasis is placed on tailor-made hybrid materials, highlighting unexpected reaction behavior due to surface and pore confinement. Accordingly, surface silylation as an efficient method for designing the microenvironment is surveyed in detail.", "In this report, we first demonstrate that chemistry is the central science from the science of matter to the science of life; i.e., chemistry is essential for food supply and resources, for understanding life processes, for providing clean and renewable energy, for material science, for information technology, and for environmental sciences. Then, we summarize the recent advances in chemical sciences in China, in nano science and technology, material chemistry, supramolecular self-assembly, organic synthesis, and more fundamentally physical and theoretical chemistry. Chinese chemists have not only made significant progress in chemical research but also assumed international responsibility in tackling globally challenging problems by collaborating with international chemists and providing chemical solutions to energy, environment, health, and resources problems. Lastly, we present some remaining challenges in chemical sciences and our perspectives on the contributions that chemistry can make towards a sustainable and harmonious society.", "Hybrid compounds RF-X-RH consisting of perfluoro and hydro moieties, RF and RH, which are connected with X functionality, are described. New crystal engineering based on these hybrid compounds is proposed as a rational method for the design of the functional materials. Hexafluoropropene trimers are selected as the fluoro synthons. A systematic investigation on the crystal structures of the hybrid compounds revealed that there are five packing motifs in connection with the topology of the molecules. Topochemical requirements for the solid-state polymerization of diacetylene functionality were satisfied with the precise tuning by tailor-made hybrid synthons. As a result, a black crystalline material with a metallic luster was synthesized. This new fluorine-based crystal engineering will be one of the unique molecular design methods for the material science.", "The direct synthesis of hierarchically intergrown silicalite-1 can be achieved using a specific diquaternary ammonium agent. However, the location of these molecules in the zeolite framework, which is critical to understand the formation of the material, remains unclear. Where traditional characterization tools have previously failed, herein we use polarized stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy to resolve molecular organization inside few-micron-sized crystals. Through a combination of experiment and first-principles calculations, our investigation reveals the preferential location of the templating agent inside the linear pores of the MFI framework. Besides illustrating the attractiveness of SRS microscopy in the field of material science to study and spatially resolve local molecular distribution as well as orientation, these results can be exploited in the design of new templating agents for the preparation of hierarchical zeolites", "Sustainable development of nanotechnology is challenged by nanoscale pollutants and oily water. Biobased nanoporous membranes, though serving as one of the most eco-friendly separation technologies, cannot be applied widely because of their broad pore distributions, poor solvent resistance, and structural instability. In order to avoid possible leakage of nanoscale objects in caustic and organic solvents, herein, we endeavored to exfoliate chitin nanofibrils with identical chemical and crystalline structures to pristine chitin in portunid carapace and further produce nanoporous and mesoporous membranes with super structural stability, endurance, permeation flux and rejection. The final membranes had minimal ionization, controllable thickness, and tunable and narrow distribution of pore size, being able to separate nano-emulsions, nanoparticles, and rigid macromolecules in caustic aqueous solutions and organic solvents. Thus, these scalable, low-cost, and sustainable membranes may promise applications as diverse as in separating and concentrating nanoparticles in nanotechnology, oil/water separation in wastewater treatment, and molecular sieving in biomedicine and material science.", "In striking contrast to simple polymer physics theory, which does not account for solvent effects, we find that physical confinement of solvated biopolymers decreases solvent entropy, which in turn leads to a reduction in the organized structural content of the polymer. Since our theory is based on a fundamental property of water\u2212protein statistical mechanics, we expect it to have broad implications in many biological and material science contexts.", "Phase diagram calculations are an important topic in material science. They are usually carried out with limited-distribution software packages. This technology report is an introduction to software based phase diagram calculations. Three spreadsheets calculators are presented. The first one plots the Gibbs free energy versus composition for Al\u2013Zn, Li\u2013Mg, and Pelton\u2019s fictional A\u2013B alloy. The second one calculates equilibrium phase composition for A\u2013B. The third one calculates the Li\u2013Mg temperature\u2013composition diagram. The coding is reduced to a minimum and calculations are directly accessible to the user. The programs aim to be practice tools to complement instructor\u2019s lectures.", "Some preliminary results from a model of temperature-sensitive contrast agents are reported. This paramagnetic system switches from a spin S = 0 diamagnetic state to a S = 2 paramagnetic one at a temperature that can be tuned according to chemical composition. The magnetic susceptibility jump and the subsequent R2* effect as a function of temperature have been followed by means of spectroscopy, relaxometry, and imaging, demonstrating sharp and reversible transitions. Potential applications of this kind of system could be found in therapy by hyperthermia or in material science.", "Catalysis over carbon, especially nanocarbon, is an attractive topic in material science and chemical engineering fields due to its significant advantages compared with conventional metal or metal oxide catalysts. This paper summarizes the recent developments, basic concepts, and commonly accepted understandings on the nature of carbon catalysis in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, including: introduction and comparison of various reaction systems; identity and quantity of active sites on carbon catalysts; mechanism for the reactions; and structure\u2013selectivity relations for modified carbon catalysts. These fruitful conclusive achievements are the basis for in-depth comprehension of carbon-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation process at the molecular level, and many other efforts, such as detailed kinetic study, precisely controllable synthetic technique for nanocarbon catalysts, are still needed to further push carbon catalysis fields to practical applications.", "Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was introduced as a highly sensitive tool to analyze interactions in polymer and material science by their thermodynamic patterns. The thermodynamic parameters \u0394H, \u0394S, \u0394G, KB, and the stoichiometric ratio of the interactions in a complex organic\u2212inorganic hybrid system were determined in a single experiment. In particular, the adsorption behavior of surface-active amphiphilic copolymers, bearing different types of anchor groups (nonionic, zwitterionic, and acidic), with SiO2 nanoparticles in a multicomponent solvent system was investigated. The knowledge of the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction provided, beside its strength, a detailed understanding of its mechanism. Particularly, for the production of the nanocomposites, this knowledge might lead to a more rational and optimized design of these materials.", "Black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets with unique biocompatibility and superior optical performance have attracted enormous attention in material science. However, their instability and poor solution-processability severely limit their clinical applications. In this work, we demonstrate the use of silk fibroin (SF) as an exfoliating agent to produce thin-layer BP nanosheets with long-term stability and facile solution-processability. Presence of SF prevents rapid oxidation and degradation of the resultant BP nanosheets, enhancing their performance in physiological environment. The SF-modified BP nanosheets exhibit subtle solution-processability and are fabricated into various BP-based material formats. As superior photothermal agents, BP-based wound dressings effectively prevent bacterial infection and promote wound repair. Therefore, this work opens new avenues for unlocking current challenges of BP nanosheet applications for practical biomedical purposes.", "We extract the distribution of both center-of-mass and angular fluctuations from three-dimensional tracking of optically trapped nanotubes. We measure the optical force and torque constants from autocorrelation and cross-correlation of the tracking signals. This allows us to isolate the angular Brownian motion. We demonstrate that nanotubes enable nanometer spatial and femtonewton force resolution in photonic force microscopy, the smallest to date. This has wide implications in nanotechnology, biotechnology, nanofluidics, and material science.", "The synthesis of 1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecaboranes (ortho-carboranes) is often low yielding which is a critical issue given the increasing use of boron clusters in material science and medicinal chemistry. To address this barrier, a series of Cu, Ag, and Au salts were screened to identify compounds that would enhance the yields of ortho-caboranes produced when treating alkynes with B10H12(CH3CN)2. Using a variety of functionalized ligands including mono- and polyfunctional internal and terminal alkynes, significant increases in yield were observed when AgNO3 was used in catalytic amounts. AgNO3 appears to prevent unwanted reduction/hydroboration of the alkyne prior to carborane formation, and the process is compatible with aryl, halo, hydroxy, nitrile, carbamate, and carbonyl functionalized alkynes.", "There has been increasing demand for materials with functional thermal properties, but traditional experiments and simulations are high-cost and time-consuming. The emerging discipline, materials informatics, is an effective approach that can accelerate materials development by combining material science and big data techniques. Recently, materials informatics has been successfully applied to designing thermal materials, such as thermal interface materials for heat-dissipation, thermoelectric materials for power generation, and so forth. This Mini Review summarizes the research progress associated with studies regarding the prediction and discovery of materials with desirable thermal transport properties by using materials informatics.

Representative isomers belonging to these benzenoid hydrocarbons are at the crossroads to homologous series that extend to infinite polymer strips that have been the object of numerous molecular modeling studies. The goal of these studies is to understand their potential electronic properties for material science applications. Along the way, some prior numerical results are supplemented.", 0, "A simple and effective approach to prepare conductive polystyrene/carbon nanofiber (PS/CNF) nanocomposite films via a solution dispersion method is presented. Inexpensive CNF, which has a structure similar to multi-walled carbon nanotubes, is chosen as a nanofiller in this experiment to achieve conductivity in PS films. A good dispersion is achieved in the PS matrix with ultrasonication. The experiment to prepare PS/CNF system is suitable as a laboratory experiment for college chemistry or material science course. The experiment provides students with a hands-on laboratory experience in nanotechnology and its related fundamental concept.", "Every pair of atoms can be bonded together showing a variety of different bonding regimes, the internuclear distance being the controlling parameter that decides under which chemical pattern a given pair will act. The type of bond that best describes a given compound is thus a consequence of the equilibrium distances on its main atomic pairs. Therefore, we should act cautiously in extrapolating the typical molecular regime to material science, particularly when high pressures or far from room temperatures are involved.", "Biodegradable electronics have great potential to reduce the environmental footprint of devices and enable advanced health monitoring and therapeutic technologies. Complex biodegradable electronics require biodegradable substrates, insulators, conductors, and semiconductors, all of which comprise the fundamental building blocks of devices. This review will survey recent trends in the strategies used to fabricate biodegradable forms of each of these components. Polymers that can disintegrate without full chemical breakdown (type I), as well as those that can be recycled into monomeric and oligomeric building blocks (type II), will be discussed. Type I degradation is typically achieved with engineering and material science based strategies, whereas type II degradation often requires deliberate synthetic approaches. Notably, unconventional degradable linkages capable of maintaining long-range conjugation have been relatively unexplored, yet may enable fully biodegradable conductors and semiconductors with uncompromised electrical properties. While substantial progress has been made in developing degradable device components, the electrical and mechanical properties of these materials must be improved before fully degradable complex electronics can be realized.", "Iron sulfides, polymorphous substances, play a key role in geology, marine systems, material science, and the life sciences. The crystal structures and phase transitions of iron\u2013sulfur compounds are complex and elusive. In this study, we fabricated most known iron sulfides, mackinawite was the first reaction product, which declined gradually until it disappeared; the following Cubic FeS and troilite presented a characteristic of layer growth. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we directly observed for the first time the transition of cubic FeS into greigite and that of mackinawite into greigite. Greigite, which is extremely unstable in an oxygen-free H2S environment, was found to play an intermediate role in the transition into a more stable phase.", "In this Account, we describe the use of perfluoropolyether (PFPE)-based materials that are able to accurately mold and replicate micro- and nanosized features using traditional techniques such as embossing as well as new techniques that we developed to exploit the exceptional surface characteristics of fluorinated substrates. Because of the unique partial wetting and nonwetting characteristics of PFPEs, we were able to go beyond the usual molding and imprint lithography approaches and have created a technique called PRINT (Particle [or Pattern] Replication In Nonwetting Templates).\nPRINT is a distinctive \u201ctop-down\u201d fabrication technique capable of generating isolated particles, arrays of particles, and arrays of patterned features for a plethora of applications in both nanomedicine and materials science. A particular strength of the PRINT technology is the high-resolution molding of well-defined particles with precise control over size, shape, deformability, and surface chemistry. The level of replication obtained showcases some of the unique characteristics of PFPE molding materials. In particular, these materials arise from very low surface energy precursors with positive spreading coefficients, can be photocured at ambient temperature, and are minimally adhesive, nonswelling, and conformable. These distinctive features enable the molding of materials with unique attributes and nanometer resolution that have unprecedented scientific and technological value. For example, in nanomedicine, the use of PFPE materials with the PRINT technique allows us to design particles in which we can tailor key therapeutic parameters such as bioavailability, biodistribution, target-specific cell penetration, and controlled cargo release. Similarly, in materials science, we can fabricate optical films and lens arrays, replicate complex, naturally occurring objects such as adenovirus particles, and create 2D patterned arrays of inorganic oxides.", "The International Carbohydrate Symposium will take place on July 17\u201321 at the New Orleans Marriott.

Public Health Service's Robert A. Taft Sanitary Engineering Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, and the National Science Teachers Association. First to be modernized are experiments involving water, air, and food.\nThe updating project originated with members of the Engineering Resources Unit of the Taft center.

The main features of the interaction are given, and the close similarity with the hydrogen bonding will become apparent. Some heuristic principles are presented to develop a rational crystal engineering based on halogen bonding. The focus is on halogen-bonded supramolecular architectures given by halocarbons. The potential of the interaction is shown by useful applications in the field of synthetic chemistry, material science, and bioorganic chemistry.", "Despite the significance of carbazole in pharmacy and material science, examples of the direct C\u2013H functionalization of this privileged unit are quite rare. The N-(2-pyridyl)sulfonyl group enables the PdII-catalyzed ortho-olefination of carbazoles and related systems, acting as both a directing and readily removable protecting group. This method features ample structural versatility, affording typically the double ortho-olefination products (at C1 and C8) in satisfactory yields and complete regiocontrol. The application of this procedure to related heterocyclic systems, such as indoline, is also described.", "Chemical characterization at the nanoscale is of significant importance for many applications in physics, analytical chemistry, material science, and biology. Despite the intensive studies in the infrared range, high-spatial-resolution and high-sensitivity imaging for compositional identification in the visible range is rarely exploited. In this work, we present a gap-plasmon-enhanced imaging approach based on photothermal-induced resonance (PTIR) for nanoscale chemical identification. With this approach, we experimentally obtained a high spatial resolution of \u223c5 nm for rhodamine nanohill characterization and achieved monolayer sensitivity for mapping the single-layer chlorophyll-a islands with the thickness of only 1.9 nm. We also successfully characterized amyloid fibrils stained with methylene blue dye, indicating that this methodology can be also utilized for identification of the radiation-insensitive macromolecules. We believe that our proposed high-performance visible PTIR system can be used to broaden the applications of nanoscale chemical identification ranging from nanomaterial to life science areas.", "Despite the significance of carbazole in pharmacy and material science, examples of the direct C\u2013H functionalization of this privileged unit are quite rare.

Dendronized oligonucleotides decorated with 7-tripropargylamine side chains carrying two terminal triple bonds were further functionalized with bis-azides to give derivatives with two terminal azido groups. Then, the branched side chains with two azido groups or two triple bonds were combined with DNA-fragments providing the corresponding clickable function. Both concepts afforded branched (Y-shaped) three-armed DNA. Annealing of branched DNA with complementary oligonucleotides yielded supramolecular assemblies. The concept of \u201cstepwise and double click\u201d chemistry combined with selective hybridization represents a flexible tool to generate DNA nanostructures useful for various purposes in DNA diagnostics, delivery, and material science applications.", "Technological progress is determined, to a great extent, by developments in material science. Breakthroughs can happen when a new type of material or new combinations of known materials with different dimensionality and functionality are created. Multilayered structures, being planar or concentric, are now emerging as major players at the forefront of research. Raman spectroscopy is a well-established characterization technique for carbon nanomaterials and is being developed for layered materials. In this issue of ACS Nano, Hirschmann et al. investigate triple-wall carbon nanotubes via resonant Raman spectroscopy, showing how a wealth of information can be derived about these complex structures. The next challenge is to tackle hybrid heterostructures, consisting of different planar or concentric materials, arranged \u201con demand\u201d to achieve targeted properties.", "Organic azides play important roles in synthetic chemistry, chemical biology, drug discovery, and material science. Azido-functionalization of alkenes is one of the most efficient procedures for rapid introduction of azide group into organic compounds. But only a few examples have been documented in the catalytic asymmetric version of the azidation of alkenes. Herein, we report an unprecedented highly diastereo- and enantioselective bromoazidation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones catalyzed by chiral N,N\u2032-dioxide/Fe(OTf)2 complexes. An array of aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl substituted \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones were transformed to the corresponding \u03b1-bromo-\u03b2-azido ketones in high yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. The catalytic system was also applicable for chloroazidation and iodoazidation of chalcone. Kinetic studies and some control experiments suggested that the reaction might proceed via a 1,4-addition/halogenation pathway.", "Refractive index changes its sign\nElectromagnetic radiation traveling through a new compos ite material is bent in a direction opposite to that seen in any other known material { Science , 292 , 77 (2001)}. The reason: The composite material has a negative refractive index. The finding confirms theoretical predictions that electromagnetic waves would behave in such a fashion if the \"right\" material were to be developed. Last year, physicists Sheldon Schultz, David R. Smith, and Richard A. Shelby of the University of California, San Diego, developed a material they predicted would fit the bill. Now they have experimentally verified that it does. The material consists of a 2-D array of copper strips and rings on interlocking strips of standard circuitboard material. Microwaves passing through a prism-shaped sample indicate that its refractive index is -2.7 In an accompanying commentary, Michael C. K. Wiltshire, a physicist at Marconi Caswell Ltd. in the U.K., notes that a negative refractive index could ...", "We report upon the design of a new gas microstrip detector (GMSD) for use in X-ray absorption spectroscopy applied to the study of catalysis and material science. We show that GMSDs can operate not only with the gas mixtures normally used in proportional counters but also with the majority of gas mixtures used in common catalytic reactions. The detector functions well in the presence of water vapor. EXAFS investigations of a test system of NiO on Ni metal are discussed in which it is demonstrated that depth profiling using electron yield X-ray absorption spectroscopy is possible in a wide variety of gaseous environments. Electron detection of XAS using GMSDs is applicable to metals, semiconductors, and insulators presented in almost all forms of sample including films, pellets, powders, crystals, and liquids.", "Geometric (Z)- and (E)-isomers play important but different roles in life and material science. The design of new (Z)-/(E)- isomers and study of their properties, behaviors, and interactions are crucially important in molecular engineering. However, difficulties with their separation and structure confirmation limit their structural diversity and functionality in scope. In the work described herein, we successfully synthesized pure isomers of ureidopyrimidinone-functionalized tetraphenylethenes ((Z)-TPE-UPy and (E)-TPE-UPy), featuring both the aggregation-induced emission characteristic of tetraphenylethene and the supramolecular polymerizability of ureidopyrimidinone. Their structures were confirmed by 2D COSY and NOESY NMR spectroscopies. The two isomers show distinct fluorescence in the aggregate state: (Z)-TPE-UPy exhibits green emission, while its (E)-counterpart is blue-emitting. The cavity formed by the two ureidopyrimidinone groups of (Z)-TPE-UPy makes it suitable for Hg2+ detection, and the high-molecular-weight polymers prepared from (E)-TPE-UPy can be used to fabricate highly fluorescent fibers and 2D/3D photopatterns from their chloroform solutions.", "Conspectus\nIncorporation of chemically modified nucleotide scaffolds into nucleic acids to form assemblies rich in function is an innovative area with great promise for nanotechnology and biomedical and material science applications. The intrinsic biorecognition potential of nucleic acids combined with advanced properties of the locked nucleic acids (LNAs) provide opportunities to develop new nanomaterials and devices like sensors, aptamers, and machines. In this Account, we describe recent research on preparation and investigation of the properties of LNA/DNA hybrids containing functionalized 2\u2032-amino-LNA nucleotides.\nBy application of different chemical reactions, modification of 2\u2032-amino-LNA scaffolds can be efficiently performed in high yields and with various tags, postsynthetically or during the automated oligonucleotide synthesis. The choice of a synthetic method for scaffolding along 2\u2032-amino-LNA mainly depends on the chemical nature of the modification, its price, its availability, and applications of the product. One of the most useful applications of the product LNA/DNA scaffolds containing 2\u2032-amino-LNA is to detect complementary DNA and RNA targets. Examples of these applications include sensing of clinically important single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imaging of nucleic acids in vitro, in cell culture, and in vivo. According to our studies, 2\u2032-amino-LNA scaffolds are efficient within diagnostic probes for DNA and RNA targets and as therapeutics, whereas both 2\u2032-amino- and isomeric 2\u2032-\u03b1-l-amino-LNA scaffolds have promising properties for stabilization and detection of DNA nanostructures. Attachment of fluorescent groups to the 2\u2032-amino group results in very high fluorescent quantum yields of the duplexes and remarkable sensitivity of the fluorescence signal to target binding. Notably, fluorescent LNA/DNA probes bind nucleic acid targets with advantages of high affinity and specificity. Thus, molecular motion of nanodevices and programmable self-assembly of chemically modified LNA/DNA nanomaterials can be followed by bright fluorescence signaling from the functionalized LNA units. Another appealing aspect of the amino-LNA scaffolds is specific targeting of nucleic acids and proteins for therapeutic applications. 2\u2032-Amino-LNA/DNA conjugates containing peptide and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) groups are promising in this context as well as for advanced imaging and diagnostic purposes in vivo. For imaging applications, photostability of fluorescence dyes is of crucial importance. Chemically stable and photostable fluorescent PAH molecules attached to 2\u2032-amino functionality of the 2\u2032-amino-LNA are potent for in vitro and in vivo imaging of DNA and RNA targets.\nWe believe that rational evolution of the biopolymers of Nature may solve the major challenges of the future material science and biomedicine. However, this requires strong scientific progress and efficient interdisciplinary research. Examples of this Account demonstrate that among other synthetic biopolymers, synthetic nucleic acids containing functionalized 2\u2032-amino-LNA scaffolds offer great opportunities for material science, diagnostics, and medicine of the future.", "The introduction of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (SRM) opened an unprecedented vista into nanoscopic length scales, unveiling a new degree of complexity in biological systems in aqueous environments. Regrettably, supramolecular chemistry and material science benefited far less from these recent developments. Here we expand the scope of SRM to photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) imaging of synthetic nanostructures that are highly dynamic in organic solvents. Furthermore, we characterize the photophysical properties of commonly used photoactivatable dyes in a wide range of solvents, which is made possible by the addition of a tiny amount of an alcohol. As proof-of-principle, we use PALM to image silica beads with radii close to Abbe\u2019s diffraction limit. Individual nanoparticles are readily identified and reliably sized in multicolor mixtures of large and small beads. We further use SRM to visualize nm-thin yet \u03bcm-long dynamic, supramolecular polymers, which are among the most challenging molecular systems to image.", "In the present Perspective, a recent approach in radiation chemistry is summarized. By employing radiation chemical methods, such as \u03b3-ray radiolysis and pulse radiolysis, powerful oxidative and reductive species can be generated to initiate various reactions. Thus, radiation chemical methods are applicable to various systems in a wide variety of fields and are not restricted to basic radical or radical ion chemistry. For example, our research group has employed radiation chemical methods to elucidate the mechanisms of various phenomena. Here, radiation chemical investigations on the charge delocalization process, excited radical ions, photocatalytic systems, emitting devices, and biological systems are introduced as examples of the wide applicability of radiation chemistry. Radiation chemical methods should be useful for a wide variety of researchers in the future as well.", "The structure\u2013property relationship is a hot research topic in both chemistry and material science. A structural descriptor has significant applications in machine learning and high-throughput screening for rapid estimations of material properties. In this work, we report a simple structural indicator to characterize the crystal-field splitting of Ce3+ ions in the garnet structure. The indicator is the interplanar distance of the octahedron, which is calculated as 2/\u221a3 | x + y + z | \u00b7 L, where L stands for the cell parameter and (x, y, z) are the oxygen coordinates in a specific form. The indicator value is correlated to the crystal-field splitting of Ce3+ in the lanthanide aluminum/gallium garnets and is able to reproduce the reverse garnet effect. By inspecting the polyhedral competition effect in the garnet structure, this indicator is found to be correlated to the tetragonal distortion of the dodecahedron, which determines the crystal-field splitting.", "In this article a simple undergraduate laboratory experiment to produce magnetic adsorbents is described. These magnetic materials efficiently adsorb contaminants from water and can be easily removed from the medium by a simple magnetic separation process. The magnetic composites can be prepared by a simple procedure based on the precipitation of magnetic iron oxides from Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts and NaOH on activated carbon or clay (two excellent adsorbents). The prepared materials can be used in various experiments such as: Harvesting the Magnetic Composite, Oil Spill Remediation, Adsorption of Metal Ions Contaminants onto Clay Composites, and Adsorption of Organic Contaminants onto Activated Carbon Composites. All these experiments illustrate several important general aspects in chemistry such as material science (clays, activated carbon, iron oxides, and magnetic materials), adsorption processes (adsorption isotherms, surface area, cation exchange, adsorption of organics, and metal ions), and environmental technology.", "This review is devoted to hybrid materials made of organic quadratic nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores embodied in various inorganic environments. In the first section are reported systems in which the inorganic moiety is a transparent mineral network (e.g., silica, zirconium phosphate, etc.) exhibiting good transparency, crystal stability, and mechanical hardness, but none of the electronic properties usually associated with material science. The second section focuses on NLO chromophores inserted into inorganic magnetic phases (more precisely, Mn2P2S6 and [MnIICrIII(ox)3]- layered structures). The issue related to possible synergies between optical and magnetic behavior (Faraday effect) is adressed. The last section is devoted to organic/inorganic hybrid assemblies combining NLO and conducting behavior. Besides the obvious transparency/conductivity trade-off, the possibility for interplay occurring through intermolecular charge transfer is discussed.", 0, "An industrial wheat straw lignin was fractionated by a multistep process involving microfiltration followed by two membrane-assisted ultrafiltration steps starting from an aqueous solvent solution. The parent lignin and the different fractions were fully characterized in terms of chemical composition and physicochemical properties by gel permeation chromatography, gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results show that the proposed process allows us to selectively control the molar mass distribution of the fractions and the related dependent properties. This strategy offers a better understanding of the structural complexity of soda pulp raw lignin and emerges as an essential tool for lignin valorization in the context of material science and preparative organic chemistry.", "Within the natural world, organisms use information stored in their material structure to generate a physical response to a wide variety of environmental changes. The ability to program synthetic materials to intrinsically respond to environmental changes in a similar manner has the potential to revolutionize material science. By designing polymeric devices capable of responsively changing shape or behavior based on information encoded into their structure, we can create functional physical behavior, including a shape-memory and an actuation capability. Here we highlight the stimuli-responsiveness and shape-changing ability of biological materials and biopolymer-based materials, plus their potential biomedical application, providing a bioperspective on shape-memory materials. We address strategies to incorporate a shape-memory (actuation) function in polymeric materials, conceptualized in terms of its relationship with inputs (environmental stimuli) and outputs (shape change). Challenges and opportunities associated with the integration of several functions in a single material body to achieve multifunctionality are discussed. Finally, we describe how elements that sense, convert, and transmit stimuli have been used to create multisensitive materials.", "A cis-3,4-di(furan-2-yl)cyclobutane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (CBDA-2) is readily prepared stereospecifically from trans-3-(2-furyl)acrylic acid, a furfural-derived compound, through a solid-state [2 + 2] photocycloaddition in 95% isolated yield. The cyclobutane ring in CBDA-2 shows desired stabilities during thermal, sunlight, and chemical tests. The single crystal structure of CBDA-2 revealed the geometry of this molecule and orientation of the two dicarboxylic acid groups displaying its potential to serve as a unique, semirigid diacid building block in material science. A preliminary study showed that condensation of this diacid with glycerol yielded a green polymer with good stability. The diacid could also be used as a cross-linker for a biobased epoxy to yield an exceptionally hard and solvent-resistant thermoset.", "Reinforcing rubbers and expanding their application galleries are two important issues in material science and engineering. In this work, we demonstrate a bioinspired design of high-performance and macroscopically responsive diene-rubber by engineering sacrificial metal\u2013ligand motifs into a chemically cross-linked architecture network. The metal\u2013ligand bonds are formed through the coordination reaction between the pyridine groups in butadiene\u2013styrene\u2013vinylpyridine rubber (VPR) and metal ions. Under external load, the metal\u2013ligand bonds serve as sacrificial bonds that preferentially rupture prior to the covalent network, which dissipates energy and facilitates rubber chain orientation. Based on the function mechanisms, the modulus, tensile strength, and toughness of the samples are simultaneously improved without sacrificing the extensibility, and these properties can be conveniently tuned by varying the structure parameters of the covalently cross-linked network and metal\u2013ligand bonds. Moreover, the dissociation/re-formation of metal\u2013ligand bonds upon heating/cooling can endow VPR with thermally triggered adaptive recovery for shape memory application.", "Noncovalent synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) organic nano-/micro-materials with controllable geometric shapes or morphologies and special luminescent and electronic properties is one of the greatest challenges in modern chemistry and material science. Control of noncovalent interactions is fundamental for realizing desired 1D structures and crucial for understanding the functions of these interactions. Here, a series of thiophene-fused phenazines composed of a halogen-substituted \u03c0-conjugated plate and a pair of flexible side chains is presented, which displays halogen-dependent 1D self-assemblies. Luminescent 1D twisted wires, straight rods, and zigzag wires, respectively, can be generated in sequence when the halogen atoms are varied from the lightest F to the heaviest I. It was demonstrated that halogen-dependent anisotropic noncovalent interactions and mirror-symmetrical crystallization dominated the 1D-assembly behaviors of this class of molecules. The methodology developed in this study provides a potential strategy for constructing 1D organic materials with unique optoelectronic functions.", "Reinforcing rubbers and expanding their application galleries are two important issues in material science and engineering. In this work, we demonstrate a bioinspired design of high-performance and macroscopically responsive diene-rubber by engineering sacrificial metal\u2013ligand motifs into a chemically cross-linked architecture network. The metal\u2013ligand bonds are formed through the coordination reaction between the pyridine groups in butadiene\u2013styrene\u2013vinylpyridine rubber (VPR) and metal ions.

The cyclobutane ring in CBDA-2 shows desired stabilities during thermal, sunlight, and chemical tests. The single crystal structure of CBDA-2 revealed the geometry of this molecule and orientation of the two dicarboxylic acid groups displaying its potential to serve as a unique, semirigid diacid building block in material science. A preliminary study showed that condensation of this diacid with glycerol yielded a green polymer with good stability. The diacid could also be used as a cross-linker for a biobased epoxy to yield an exceptionally hard and solvent-resistant thermoset.", "By monitoring the polarized light scattering from individual gold nanorods in a darkfield microscope, we are able to determine their orientation as a function of time. We demonstrate time resolution of milliseconds and observation times of hours by observing the two-dimensional rotational diffusion of gold rods attached to a glass surface. The observed orientational diffusion shows a fast component of about 60 ms and \u201csticky times\u201d of seconds. The large signal-to-noise ratio, chemical and photochemical stability, fast time response, and small size of these gold nanorods make them an ideal probe for orientation sensing in material science and molecular biology.", "The development and investigation of heteroazo switches has flourished in recent years. Because of their specific photophysical and photochemical properties, they find versatile applications from material science to medicine. However, a deep mechanistic understanding is needed to be able to predict the properties of such azoswitches. In particular, the effect of different substituents on the azo chromophore is of great interest as they are often crucial for embedding the molecular switch into a system of interest. Herein, we provide a detailed spectroscopic and computational study on the influence of substituents on 3-phenylazoindoles chosen as models. We will point out changes in absorption properties and analyze the photostationary state of the thermally labile Z isomers through computational means to provide a general structure\u2013property relationship guideline for further use of these compounds.", "GE Plastics is buying out partners in two joint ventures in advance of its sale to Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC), which is expected to be completed later this quarter.\nGE is purchasing Bayer Material-Science's 50% stake in Exatec, a joint venture formed in 1998 to promote the use of polycarbonate in automotive windows.\nExatec developed a plasma-enhanced vapor-deposition process intended to coat polycarbonate windows and give it abrasion resistance comparable to glass. The venture also tackled problems such as polycarbonate's low UV resistance. It says polycarbonate's advantages in windows include low weight and design flexibility. To date, Exatec says, car companies have been evaluating the materials but have yet to adopt them on a large scale.\n\"With the demand for lightweight, environmentally responsible vehicles projected to grow globally over the next few years, the time is right to restructure the joint venture and take it to the next level,\" says Exatec CEO John Madej. ...", "Fluorous solid-phase extraction (FSPE) has been employed to isolate target compounds from complex chemical or biological samples in many research areas. However, the lack of efficient and economical available perfluorinated materials impeded its development. In this study, we present a novel nanographite fluoride-based fluorous solid-phase extraction (GF-FSPE) as a replacement of commercially available cartridge-based FSPE, which showed remarkable selectivity, low LOD, high post enrichment recovery, and large enrichment capacity. To demonstrate the potency of GF-FSPE, it was designed and successfully applied to isolate cysteine-containing peptide subsets from complex protein samples to improve the proteome coverage. Additionally, since graphite fluoride was inexpensive and highly commercialized, this study was expected to promote the popularization of FSPE in both chemical and biological separations as well as encourage the synthesis and broaden the application of highly fluorinated carbon fluoride in material science.", "Proteins are considered to be one of the most important highly reproducible and monodisperse building blocks with specific functions in life sciences and material science. Protein capsules and their hybrids composed of protein\u2013polymer conjugates have been intensively explored in drug delivery, catalysis, and cell-mimicking functions. Herein, we present a facile, universal, and efficient method to fabricate the diverse protein capsules, independent of the molecular weight (Mw), isoelectric points (IEP), wettability, amino acid sequence, and functional domains of enumerated proteins. The protein capsules were well characterized by various techniques. Furthermore, their ability to store the original protein functionality was demonstrated, which was mainly embodied in their enzyme responsiveness and good biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. We believe that these protein capsules have multiple potential applications such as in drug delivery, tissue engineering, catalysis, and other application fields.", "TransForm Pharmaceuticals is building a culture of excellence and innovation leading to the development of important new medicines for the patients we serve.

Both fluorescence and ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) absorption of the polymer dots showed a sensitive and reversible response to pH. The mechanism of pH-dependent optical properties was investigated. The existence of two proton-responsive functional groups (phenolic hydroxyl groups and amine groups) on the polymer dot surface is crucial. The pH-dependent fluorescence is ascribed to electron transfer, which is controlled by the protonation degree of amine groups, while the pH-dependent UV\u2013vis absorption is induced by ionization of phenolic hydroxyl groups. Based on the pH-mediated optical properties, a colorimetric and fluorescent dual-signal pH sensor and multiple logic gates were developed. The fluorescent nonconjugated polymer dots with easy preparation and sensitive response to pH are very promising for applications in biological, pharmaceutical, and material science fields.", "Bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) are polyhedral organelles containing an enzyme cluster wrapped inside a protein shell and carry out specific enzyme reactions in bacteria. These organelles have been explored meticulously using genetic, structural, and biochemical tools; however, their application in material science has not been explored much. In this study, we have used the external shell surface of MCP as a scaffold for the fabrication of gold nanoparticles displayed in 3D. This resulted in the formation of a protein scaffolded gold nanoparticle shell enclosing an active enzyme cluster. The surface scaffolded gold nanoparticles demonstrated standard catalysis, while the internal enzyme cluster of the MCPs demonstrated no loss in activity due to this fabrication. Under ambient conditions for in vitro inorganic reaction, the shell proteins sturdily maintain the barrier between the luminal enzyme and the surface inorganic catalysts and preserve the functionality of the core enzyme cluster. The MCP-AuNPs hybrid catalysts inspire a pristine class of resources that can be used in a chemical reaction condition without perturbing core biological environment for enzymatic activity. This system provides insight for fabricating uniform size nanoparticles in 3D for the development of orthogonal hybrid catalytic material.", "BY COMBINING experimental and computational methods to examine an amine-functionalized metal-organic-framework (MOF) compound, researchers in Canada have identified the chemical nature of carbon dioxide-binding sites in that porous crystalline material ( Science2010,330, 650). The study reveals molecular-level details of nitrogen-CO 2 interactions, which are central to commercial CO 2 -scrubbing systems. The findings could lead to advances in carbon-capture technology.\nCarbon cleanup in industrial settings today is often carried out by flowing flue gases through a column containing an aqueous solution of amine compounds such as monoethanolamine to selectively extract CO 2 from the exhaust stream. The CO 2 -enriched solution is then typically heated to above 100\u00b0C to remove the CO 2 and regenerate the amine solution.\nTechnology based on those processes is well established. Nevertheless, various shortcomings, such as the corrosive nature of the solutions and the high energy input required to regenerate them, leave room for improvement.\nSolid ...", "Ruddlesden\u2013Popper organic lead halides (RPOLHs) are in the material science spotlight because of their remarkable optoelectronic properties, tailorable compositions, and improved ambient stability over their three-dimensional perovskite analogues.

Our method yields polycrystalline materials useful for thin-film fabrication for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, we report the growth dynamics of BA2[FAPbI3]PbI4 using in situ small-angle X-ray scattering, revealing that the slabs grow within the first seconds of the reaction and then self-assemble into bulk crystallites.", "A novel oligo(ethylenediamino)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin-modified gold nanoparticle (OEA-CD-NP) was synthesized as a vector for DNA binding and comprehensively investigated by means of absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopies as well as transmission electron microscopy, and its plasmid transfection efficiency as a carrier into cultivated cells in vitro was also evaluated. Possessing many hydrophobic cavities at the outer space, OEA-CD-NP may have a capability of carrying biological and/or medicinal substrates into cells, which will make it potentially applicable in many fields of material science and biological technology. In contrast with OEA-CD-NP, the oligo(ethylenediamino)-lipoic amido-modified gold nanoparticle (OEA-L-NP) without CD was synthesized to investigate the interaction with DNA. The results showed that OEA-L-NPs could only weakly bind DNA.\nKeywords: Nanoparticles; cyclodextrin; DNA; gene transfection; cytotoxicity", "The precise manipulation, localization, and assembly of biological and bioinspired molecules into organized structures have greatly promoted material science and bionanotechnology. Further technological innovation calls for new patternable soft materials with the long-sought qualities of environmental tolerance and functional flexibility. Here, we report a patterned amyloid material (PAM) platform for producing hierarchically ordered structures that integrate these material attributes. This platform, combining soft lithography with generic amyloid monomer inks (consisting of genetically engineered biofilm proteins dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol), along with methanol-assisted curing, enables the spatially controlled deposition and in situ reassembly of amyloid monomers. The resulting patterned structures exhibit spectacular chemical and thermal stability and mechanical robustness under harsh conditions. The PAMs can be programmed for a vast array of multilevel functionalities, including anchoring nanoparticles, enabling diverse fluorescent protein arrays, and serving as self-supporting porous sheets for cellular growth. This PAM platform will not only drive innovation in biomanufacturing but also broaden the applications of patterned soft architectures in optics, electronics, biocatalysis, analytical regents, cell engineering, medicine, and other areas.", "Food rheology is considered the material science for food systems. Rheological approaches to shelf-life and freshness may range from a simple squeezing technique to advanced oscillatory methodologies probing material microstructure. As rheology relates to consumer perceptions of quality and freshness, a more common sensory term, texture, is employed. Changes in texture and stability during storage have been recognized as important factors influencing consumer acceptability of many food products. Texture is a complex attribute of food quality and can only be measured directly by sensory evaluation. However, many instrumental methods are used to measure mechanical properties of foods that are, up to a certain extent, related to sensory characteristics. Large strain methods such as puncture, penetration, bending, tension, shear, compression, and texture profile analysis are commonly used to evaluate freshness and textural changes of foods with respect to storage conditions. For fluid foods, various rheological techniques evaluate yield stress and shear viscosity, providing information about pourability, thickness, and dispersion or emulsion stability over time. Small strain methods, specifically dynamic oscillatory shear and mechanical analyses, are useful in probing microstructure, viscoelastic properties, and phase transitions in food materials. This chapter reviews rheological methods applicable to assessment of freshness and textural stability of foods.", "The extraordinary properties of biological materials often result from their sophisticated hierarchical structures. Through multilevel and cross-scale structural designs, biological materials offset the weakness of their individual building blocks and enhance performance at multiple length scales to match the multifunctional needs of organisms. One essential merit of hierarchical structure is that it can optimize the interfacial features of the \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d at different length scales, from the molecular level to the macroscale. Understanding the roles of biological material interfaces (BMIs) on the determination of properties and functions of biological materials has become a growing interdisciplinary research area in recent years. A pivotal aim of these studies is to use BMIs as inspiration for developing bioinspired and biomimetic materials and devices with advanced structures and functions. Given these considerations, this review aims to comprehensively discuss the structure\u2013property\u2013function relationships of BMIs in nature. We particularly focus on the discussion of BMIs and their inspired materials from mechanical and optical perspectives because these two directions are the most well-investigated and closely related. The challenges and directions of design and fabrication of BMI-inspired mechanical and optical materials are also discussed.

First, we introduce the unique advances on ultrathin 2D nanomaterials, followed by the description of their composition and crystal structures. The assortments of their synthetic methods are then summarized, including insights on their advantages and limitations, alongside some recommendations on suitable characterization techniques. We also discuss in detail the utilization of these ultrathin 2D nanomaterials for wide ranges of potential applications among the electronics/optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, photocatalysis, and sensing platforms.

These ferrofluids were prepared by the electrostatic coupling of single-strand (ss) DNA with paramagnetic lipids. DNA molecules, as rigid parts, offer the orientational anisotropy and lipids (surfactants) due to the flexible hydrocarbon chains suppress crystallization, hybrids with DNA significantly increase the Cure temperature (Tc) of the lipids. The ferrofluids possess good fluidity and low viscosity. They serve as excellent solvents for both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. Their strong magnetism further allows the solutes to be controlled by external magnetic force. The DNA\u2013lipid hybrid ferrofluids show liquid crystal (LC) behavior at low temperatures, and the LC phase is made of ordered multilamellar structures.

In this Perspective, we provide insights into the phenomenon of halogen bonding, with special focus on its role in drug discovery. We summarize the theoretical background defining its strength and directionality, provide a systematic analysis of its occurrence and interaction geometries in protein\u2013ligand complexes, and give recent examples where halogen bonding has been successfully harnessed for lead identification and optimization.

Most studies are concerned with well-separated features on flat surfaces, and there are only few studies that deal with samples of high feature density or even three-dimesional objects. The reason is that the external laser irradiation of the optical antenna (e.g., tip or particle) also directly irradiates the sample and therefore gives rise to a background. Here we introduce an efficient background suppression scheme that makes use of feedback modulation. The method is widely applicable and not restricted to cantilever-based scanning schemes. We apply this technique to both dense samples of dye molecules and ion channel proteins in plasma membranes and demonstrate effective background suppression and strongly improved sensitivity. The feedback modulation scheme is expected to find application for biological studies in liquid environments and for investigations of subsurface features in material science.", "A new member of the metalloporphyrinoid class, the one-carbon short corrole, has been developed in the past decade to a very accessible and easily tunable compound with many potential applications in material science and catalysis. Other than for the structurally related iron porphyrins, all attempts to prepare and study the \u201cnaked\u201d iron triphenylcorrole molecule (FeTPC) in bulk have failed. Here, we demonstrate stabilization of FeTPC as adsorbates on a surface. Local investigations by means of scanning tunneling microscopy reveal that along with the adsorption of FeTPC in a saddle conformation, surface induced chirality is the result. Using scanning tunneling microscopy as a local manipulation tool, individual molecules can be controllably switched between different orientations and conformations. Even conformations which are unfavorable during the adsorption process are feasible. The presented experiments demonstrate that metalated corroles are a highly interesting class of metalloporphyrinoids for local investigations but, in comparison with the well established class of porphyrins, add an additional degree of experimental freedom via chirality.", "Organic halides are vitally important chemical precursors or intermediates in the fields of agrochemical synthesis, molecular recognition, and material science. However, it is difficult to selectively synthesize these compounds due to the multiple reactive sites in aryl fragments. In this work, we prepared the first fully fluorinated porous aromatic framework (PAF). Its \u2212C\u2013F bond and hierarchical porosity have great benefits for PAF functionalization. After being decorated with different cyclodextrins (CDs), CD-PAF materials can incorporate diverse aryl compounds to protect their ortho sites from being attacked to produce para-substituted molecules. This selectivity obviously increased with a decrease in the substrate size (from 0.97 to 0.41 nm). In addition, the CD-PAFs can undergo long-term use in both chlorination and bromination.", "Despite its importance in drug and material science, spectroscopic characterization of polymorphs or supramolecular structures of paramagnetic systems often poses challenges, particularly for noncrystalline solids. This work demonstrates that 13C solid-state NMR (SSNMR) of paramagnetic systems under very fast magic angle spinning (VFMAS) (spinning speed of 20 kHz or higher) provides exceptionally sensitive means to probe small structural difference among polymorphs of paramagnetic complexes in noncrystalline solids, including drugs and materials containing paramagnetic metal ions. 13C VFMAS SSNMR experiments and corresponding ab initio shift calculations for Cu(II)(8-quilinolinol)2, anticancer agents, show that \u03b1- and \u03b2-forms of this compound can be easily distinguished by notable difference in paramagnetic relaxation times and hyperfine shifts. It is also shown that applications of the present technique allow for quantitative and chemical characterization of solid-state reactions for Cu(8-quilinolinol)2 and Cu(imidazole)2 in a noninvasive manner.", "Inspired by biological cell membranes, various \u201csmart\u201d and efficient gating nanoporous devices have been proposed to imitate and to understand life processes.

Large quantities of byssus waste material from mussel mariculture are produced every year, which have great potential as a raw starting material for producing sustainable advanced materials. In this work, we developed a facile and scalable method to synthesize whole byssus-based porous matrices that retain part of the hierarchical organization of the pristine material at the nanoscale. The resulting material is biocompatible and maintains important native byssus features: metal ion chelation (\u226512 mg/g), collagen domains, and hierarchical organization, with tunable properties controlled via metal ion content. Furthermore, these biocompatible matrices showed a dye absorbing efficiency (up to 64 mg/g for anionic dyes) that was similar to or higher than that of the pristine byssus, a proof of preservation of structural motifs. These findings indicate that biorenewable matrices originating from byssus waste could have potential use in biomedical engineering and applied material science.", "By combining the advantages of enzymatic synthesis with those offered by polyelectrolyte templates, Massachusetts researchers have developed a simple, environmentally benign way to make conducting polyaniline.\nConducting polymers are under intense investigation for use in applications such as lightweight batteries, antistatic coatings, and optical displays.

We report here a fluorogenic probe that is activated by click chemistry, a highly versatile bio-orthogonal and chemoselective ligation reaction which is based on the azide moiety as the functional group. The electron-donating properties of the triazole ring that is formed in the course of the coupling reaction was effectively utilized to modulate the fluorescence output of an electronically coupled coumarin fluorophore. Under physiological conditions the probe is essentially nonfluorescent and undergoes a bright emission enhancement upon ligation with an azide. Time-resolved emission spectroscopy and semiempirical quantum-mechanical calculations suggest that the fluorescence switching is due to an inversion of the energy ordering of the emissive 1(\u03c0,\u03c0*) and nonemissive 3(n,\u03c0*) excited states. The rapid kinetics of the ligation reaction render the probe attractive for a wide range of applications in biology, analytical chemistry, or material science.", "DNA has become one of the most extensively used molecular building blocks for engineering self-assembling materials. DNA origami is a technique that uses hundreds of short DNA oligonucleotides, called staple strands, to fold a long single-stranded DNA, which is called a scaffold strand, into various designer nanoscale architectures. DNA origami has dramatically improved the complexity and scalability of DNA nanostructures. Due to its high degree of customization and spatial addressability, DNA origami provides a versatile platform with which to engineer nanoscale structures and devices that can sense, compute, and actuate. These capabilities open up opportunities for a broad range of applications in chemistry, biology, physics, material science, and computer science that have often required programmed spatial control of molecules and atoms in three-dimensional (3D) space.

Here, we developed a dual visual reagent based on Pdots for anticounterfeiting applications. We first designed and synthesized two types of photoswitchable Pdots by incorporating photochromic dyes with multicolor semiconducting polymers to modulate their emission intensities and wavelengths. The resulting full-color Pdot assays showed that the colorimetric and fluorescent dual-readout abilities enabled the Pdots to serve as an anticounterfeiting reagent with low background interference. We also doped these Pdots into flexible substrates and prepared these Pdots as inks for pen handwriting as well as inkjet printing. We further applied this reagent in printing paper and checks for high-security anticounterfeiting purposes. We believe that this dual-readout method based on Pdots will create a new avenue for developing new generations of anticounterfeiting technologies.", "The synthesis of precisely defined nanoscale hybrid materials remains a challenge at the frontier of chemistry and material science. In particular, the assembly of diverse high-aspect ratio one-dimensional materials such as gold nanorods and carbon nanotubes into functional systems is of ever increasing interest due to their electronic and sensing applications. To meet these challenges, methods for interfacing gold nanorods with carbon materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in a regio-controlled manner are needed. Herein, we report a method for the regiospecific synthesis of terminally linked gold nanorod-SWCNTs based on a nanotube surface protection strategy. The key to our approach is a SWCNT surface protection procedure allowing for selective functionalization of the SWCNT termini.", "Constructing artificial helical structures through hierarchical self-assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are important, and they help gain insight from the structures, processes, and functions from the biological helices and facilitate the development of material science and nanotechnology. Herein, the two enantiomers of chiral Au(I) complexes (S)-1 and (R)-1 were synthesized, and they exhibited impressive spontaneous hierarchical self-assembly transitions from vesicles to helical fibers. An impressive chirality inversion and amplification was accompanied by the assembly transition, as elucidated by the results of in situ and time-dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope imaging. The two enantiomers could serve as ideal chiral templates to co-assemble with other achiral luminogens to efficiently induce the resulting co-assembly systems to show circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Our work has provided a simple but efficient way to explore the sophisticated self-assembly process and presented a facile and effective strategy to fabricate architectures with CPL properties.", "By means of density functional theory, a hexanuclear sandwich complex [18]annulene-Li6-[18]annulene which consists of a central Li6 hexagon ring and large face-capping ligands, [18]annulene, is designed and investigated. The large interaction energy and HOMO\u2013LUMO gap suggest that this novel charge-separated complex is highly stable and may be experimentally synthesized. In addition, the stability found in the [18]annulene-Li6-[18]annulene complex extends to multidecker sandwich clusters (Li6)n([18]annulene)n+1 (n = 2\u20133). The energy gain upon addition of a [18]annulene-Li6 unit to (Li6)n\u22121([18]annulene)n is pretty large (96.97\u201398.22 kcal/mol), indicating that even larger multideckers will also be very stable. Similar to ferrocene, such a hexanuclear sandwich complex could be considered as a versatile building block to find potential applications in different areas of chemistry, such as nanoscience and material science.", "Mechanoresponsive luminescent materials have attracted widespread attention for their potential applications, especially for these behaving pressure-induced emission enhancement (PIEE). Designing and seeking systems with high-efficiency PIEE are desirable and crucial for material science. Here, the mechanisms of different piezoresponsive luminescence of 2,3,4,5-tetraphenylthiophene (TPT) and 2,3,4,5-tetraphenylfuran (TPF) crystals are explored. The experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) theory calculation indicate that the PIEE phenomenon is possibly exhibited in V-shape arrangement for the reason of the weak \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions. This study not only gains deep insight into the relationship between optical properties and structural evolution but also puts forward a strategy for designing PIEE materials from the point of molecular arrangement.", "Lanthanoid luminescence has become an important pillar for many modern photonics applications such as bioanalytical research or functional material science. So far, however, thulium despite having one of the most interesting photophysics among the lanthanoids has suffered from extremely low luminescence efficiencies in molecular complexes with organic sensitizer ligands. This has greatly hampered the investigation and application of thulium emission in solution. Here, the discovery of a powerful sensitizer for thulium photoluminescence is reported. The corresponding thulium complex exhibits emission efficiencies (quantum yield \u03a6 > 0.12%; lifetime \u03c4obs = 4.6 \u03bcs; brightness \u03b5\u03a6 > 30 M\u20131 cm\u20131) and can even be detected at low micromolar concentrations in high-phonon solvents like water without the need for laser excitation.", "Here is the first report the creation of ferrofluids of thermotropic liquid crystals in the absence of any solvent or nanoparticle. These ferrofluids were prepared by the electrostatic coupling of single-strand (ss) DNA with paramagnetic lipids. DNA molecules, as rigid parts, offer the orientational anisotropy and lipids (surfactants) due to the flexible hydrocarbon chains suppress crystallization, hybrids with DNA significantly increase the Cure temperature (Tc) of the lipids. The ferrofluids possess good fluidity and low viscosity. They serve as excellent solvents for both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. Their strong magnetism further allows the solutes to be controlled by external magnetic force. The DNA\u2013lipid hybrid ferrofluids show liquid crystal (LC) behavior at low temperatures, and the LC phase is made of ordered multilamellar structures. Compared with conventional magnetic nanoparticle dispersions, the solvent-free lipoplex ferrofluids provide potential applications for nanotechnology, material science, and biotechnology.", "Pioneering electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements of \u03b1-Bi2O3 are performed on three samples obtained through different synthesis methods. Experimental low-loss and core-loss EELS spectra are acquired. By combining them with detailed structural characterization and Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations, we are able to detect and evaluate the presence of oxygen vacancies in the samples. This type of information has not been accessed previously from EELS data in bismuth oxide, because high-resolution EELS spectra or how vacancies reflect in Bi2O3 spectra were unreported. This novel measurement is further validated through comparison with photoluminescence data. Therefore, the technique has the ability to probe oxygen vacancies in Bi2O3 at an unprecedented resolution, which might allow solving material science and technological issues related to this material.", "Colorimetric analysis of broadband illumination scattered from isolated gold nanorods and reduced symmetry Dolmen structures provide a visible measure of the local nanoscale orientation of the nanostructures relative to the laboratory frame of reference. Polarized dark-field scattering microscopy correlated with scanning electron microscopy of low and high aspect ratio gold nanorods demonstrated accuracies of 2.3 degrees, which is a 5-fold improvement over photothermal and defocused imaging methods. By assigning the three color channels of the imaging detector (red, green, and blue) to the plasmon resonance wavelengths of the nanostructure, the quantitative display of orientation improved by 200%. The reduced symmetry of a gold nanorod Dolmen structure further improved the sensitivity of colorimetric orientation by a factor of 2 due to the comparative intensities of the resonances. Thus the simplicity, high accuracy, and sensitivity of visual colorimetric sensing of local nanoscale orientation holds promise for high throughput, inexpensive structure and dynamics studies in biology and material science.", "A new member of the metalloporphyrinoid class, the one-carbon short corrole, has been developed in the past decade to a very accessible and easily tunable compound with many potential applications in material science and catalysis. Other than for the structurally related iron porphyrins, all attempts to prepare and study the \u201cnaked\u201d iron triphenylcorrole molecule (FeTPC) in bulk have failed. Here, we demonstrate stabilization of FeTPC as adsorbates on a surface. Local investigations by means of scanning tunneling microscopy reveal that along with the adsorption of FeTPC in a saddle conformation, surface induced chirality is the result. Using scanning tunneling microscopy as a local manipulation tool, individual molecules can be controllably switched between different orientations and conformations. Even conformations which are unfavorable during the adsorption process are feasible. The presented experiments demonstrate that metalated corroles are a highly interesting class of metalloporphyrinoids for local investigations but, in comparison with the well established class of porphyrins, add an additional degree of experimental freedom via chirality.", "THE ORNATE GLASS cages that diatoms call home are getting a high\u2013tech makeover, courtesy of chemistry. Materials scientists have developed a way to convert the unicellular algae's intricate silica exoskeletons into silicon without destroying their architectural finery ( Nature2007 , 446, 172)\nThe resulting rococo microstructures could find use in sensing, optical, and electronic applications, according to Georgia Institute of Technology's Kenneth H. Sandhage, who led the research effort\nTo strip the oxygen atoms out of the silica structures, Sandhage's group seals the exoskeletons in a steel ampoule along with some magnesium granules and then heats up the apparatus to 650 \u00b0C. That's hot enough to generate magnesium gas, which reduces the silica to elemental silicon. It's not so hot, however, that the silicon becomes volatile so the glassy cage's original shape remains intact. A bath in hydrochloric acid removes any oxidized magnesium from the structure, leaving only silicon behind.\nDavid J. Norrism a materials science ...", "The mussel byssus is a biorenewable, protein-based material produced by marine mussels, which has attracted the interest of material scientists because of its remarkable mechanical and self-healing properties. Large quantities of byssus waste material from mussel mariculture are produced every year, which have great potential as a raw starting material for producing sustainable advanced materials. In this work, we developed a facile and scalable method to synthesize whole byssus-based porous matrices that retain part of the hierarchical organization of the pristine material at the nanoscale. The resulting material is biocompatible and maintains important native byssus features: metal ion chelation (\u226512 mg/g), collagen domains, and hierarchical organization, with tunable properties controlled via metal ion content. Furthermore, these biocompatible matrices showed a dye absorbing efficiency (up to 64 mg/g for anionic dyes) that was similar to or higher than that of the pristine byssus, a proof of preservation of structural motifs. These findings indicate that biorenewable matrices originating from byssus waste could have potential use in biomedical engineering and applied material science.", "This Article investigates the important, and often overlooked, structure\u2013property relationships underlying the complex viscoelastic and adhesion behaviors of soft polyester elastomers, an emerging class of degradable biomaterials with promising applications in industry, biotechnology, and medicine. A family of poly(isosorbide fatty alkylates) with different molecular architectures and physical aspects (viscous, sticky, rubbery, solid) is reported. We demonstrate that the adhesiveness of these materials can be mainly understood in terms of bulk viscoelasic factors, in contrast to alternative ideas reported in the literature. These results shed some light on the intimate structure of bioelastomers, and notably on the decisive role of a well-adjusted macroscopic cluster of percolated polyester chains for tailoring key biomaterial functions such as elasticity, stickiness, fibrillation, and biodegradation. By establishing a bridge between polyester biomaterials and the material science of sticky things, this Article provides robust design principles for diverse functional biomaterials with tailored dissipative characters such as adhesives with tunable stickiness and degradation profiles, or scaffolds mimicking the nonlinear elasticity of supersoft biological tissues.", "Chemoselective ligation reactions represent a powerful approach for labeling of proteins or small molecules in a biological environment. We report here a fluorogenic probe that is activated by click chemistry, a highly versatile bio-orthogonal and chemoselective ligation reaction which is based on the azide moiety as the functional group. The electron-donating properties of the triazole ring that is formed in the course of the coupling reaction was effectively utilized to modulate the fluorescence output of an electronically coupled coumarin fluorophore. Under physiological conditions the probe is essentially nonfluorescent and undergoes a bright emission enhancement upon ligation with an azide. Time-resolved emission spectroscopy and semiempirical quantum-mechanical calculations suggest that the fluorescence switching is due to an inversion of the energy ordering of the emissive 1(\u03c0,\u03c0*) and nonemissive 3(n,\u03c0*) excited states. The rapid kinetics of the ligation reaction render the probe attractive for a wide range of applications in biology, analytical chemistry, or material science.", "Point defects can have significant impact on the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of materials. The development of robust, multidimensional, high-throughput, and large-scale characterization techniques of defects is thus crucial for the establishment of integrated nanophotonic technologies and material growth optimization. Here, we demonstrate the potential of wide-field spectral single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) for the determination of ensemble spectral properties as well as the characterization of spatial, spectral, and temporal dynamics of single defects in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown and irradiated exfoliated hexagonal boron-nitride materials. We characterize the heterogeneous spectral response of our samples and identify at least two types of defects in CVD-grown materials, while irradiated exfoliated flakes show predominantly only one type of defects. We analyze the blinking kinetics and spectral emission for each type of defects and discuss their implications with respect to the observed spectral heterogeneity of our samples. Our study shows the potential of wide-field spectral SMLM techniques in material science and paves the way toward the quantitative multidimensional mapping of defect properties.", "The synthesis of precisely defined nanoscale hybrid materials remains a challenge at the frontier of chemistry and material science.

The study is carried out by using electronic absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, electrochemistry, vibrational Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations in the framework of DFT and TD\u2212DFT theories. Optical spectra are described in terms of one-electron promotions between orbitals around the energy gap. Electrochemistry, in the framework of the Koopman's approach, is also interpreted. The vibrational Raman spectra are assigned to molecular modes and the evolution changing the heteroatom is addressed and an effective tuning of these properties is found. Part of this modulation is associated with local electronic interactions depending on the relative S, Se, and Te electronegativities. Unconventional long-range heteroatom\u2212heteroatom interactions have been proposed which arise from the existence of effective \u03c0-conjugated channels. The molecular level understanding of structure\u2212property relationships in these organic/inorganic semiconductors are of great interest in the interdisciplinary area of material science.", "A simple structuring method for graphitic structures based on the catalytic properties of cerium oxide nanoparticles under oxidizing conditions is presented. Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite chips were impregnated with well-dispersed ceria nanoparticles and then treated at elevated temperatures for several hours. Oxidation activities on the particle surface appeared as crystallographically independent traces that were formed on the graphite and provide a simple method to manufacture nanogrooves at large scale. By altering treatment durations and temperatures, the optimal conditions and activity parameters of the particles were determined. A systematic AFM evaluation allowed formulating of a mechanism of the etching process. The findings provide a simple procedure for the patterning of graphitic structures, formation of nanogrooves and thereby a basic tool for material science with respect to the manufacturing of atmospheric nanofilters and ion-selective membranes.", "Sticky rice lime mortar (SRLM) is a widely used lime-based gelled material in ancient China. Sticky rice plays an important role in the formation of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material. Inspired by this, a nanostructured organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material (NOHM) was constructed based on the regulation of nanocellulose (NCC) on the crystallization of calcium carbonate. The used NCC was prepared by a green way via simultaneous ball milling and phosphotungstic acid catalyzed hydrolysis. The characteristics of the prepared NOHM were explored to gain insight into the interaction of NCC and mineral during the mineralization of calcium carbonate. The results indicate that nanocellulose plays a crucial role in the formation of nanostructured organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material, which not only induces and regulates the mineralization process of calcium carbonate crystals but also affects the morphology and size of the formed calcium carbonate crystals. The mechanical strength and durability of NOHM were significantly improved with the regulation of NCC. The results not only suggest new hypotheses about the role of polysaccharide in the mineralization process but also serve to shed light on the formation process of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material regulated by polysaccharide.", "Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) in titania supported noble metals has been a subject of many studies due to its importance to many fields of science, in particular to material science and catalysis system. H2 reduction at a high temperature has been commonly considered as the inducement to SMSI in TiO2 supported noble metals. This work, however, demonstrates that SMSI in Pt/TiO2 can occur through mild NaBH4 and HCHO solution reduction processes based on CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations. Moreover, the effect of TiO2 crystalline forms on the degree of SMSI in NaBH4 reduced Pt/TiO2 and the performance of the as-reduced catalysts for trace toluene combustion reaction were studied. It was found that the degree of SMSI in Pt/TiO2 drew a significant effect on the catalytic performance. Our discovery provides a new way to control the interaction between noble metals and the TiO2 support as well as their catalytic activities.", "Proteins possess an impressive array of functionality ranging from catalytic activity to selective binding and mechanical strength, making them highly attractive for materials engineering. Conjugation of synthetic polymers to proteins has the potential to improve the physical properties of the protein as well as provide functionality not typically found in native proteins, such as stimuli-responsive behavior and the programmable ability to self-assemble. This viewpoint discusses the design of protein\u2013polymer conjugates, an important class of block copolymers. Use of these hybrid molecules in biological and catalytic applications is highlighted, and the ability of the polymer to direct the solution and solid-state self-assembly of the hybrid block copolymers is reviewed. Future challenges in polymer and material science that will enable these hybrid molecules to reach their potential as protein-based materials are outlined.", "SCIENTISTS AT Northwestern University have discovered a mechanism for forming peptide-based liquid crystals that can be drawn by hand into long, highly aligned, gel-like nanofiber bundles with the shapes of noodles ( Nat.

Stupp and coworkers start with amphiphilic small molecules consisting of peptides with long alkyl chains. When heated in solution, these molecules organize themselves into two-dimensional plaques. As the solution cools, those plaques break into bundles of highly aligned nanofibers.

The KNA/PCM films with high thermal management capability and infrared emissivity comparable to that of various backgrounds demonstrate high performance in IR stealth in outdoor environments with solar illumination variations. To further realize hiding hot targets from IR detection, combined structures constituted of thermal insulation layers (KNA films) and ultralow IR transmittance layers (KNA/PCM) are proposed.

Yet, there is at present no theoretical framework that permits the identification of flexible structures in the rapidly expanding universe of MOFs. Here, we propose a simple method to predict whether a MOF is flexible, based on treating it as a system of rigid elements, connected by hinges. This proposition is correct in application to MOFs based on rigid carboxylate linkers. We validate the method by correctly classifying known experimental MOFs into rigid and flexible groups. Applied to hypothetical MOFs, the method reveals an abundance of flexibility phenomena, and this seems to be at odds with the proportion of flexible structures among experimentally known MOFs. We speculate that the flexibility of a MOF may constitute an intrinsic impediment on its experimental realization. This highlights the importance of systematic prediction of large amplitude flexibility regimes in MOFs.", "A random walk or, more correctly, a random climb on a simple cubic lattice is a very simple model of a polymer molecule that is easily visualized and, as we show, can be utilized to describe a variety of physical properties. The model is used to calculate average sizes of homopolymers and copolymers in solution when the segments either have or do not have orientational biases. We also employ it to treat molecules that have many local intrachain attractions and calculate their average sizes as functions of the interaction strength. In spite of these capabilities, the random-climb model is rarely, if ever, presented in the polymer educational literature. This article attempts to remedy that situation by drawing attention to the model's inherent advantages and serving as an introduction to polymer physical properties for students studying chemistry, chemical engineering, material science and related fields.", "A waveguide structure supporting long-range surface plasmon waves in any gaseous or liquid environment is described. The waveguide comprises a large area dielectric membrane of nanometric thickness upon which thin metal stripes and features are deposited. This structure allows the environment to surround the stripe thus ensuring that an essentially symmetric dielectric background is always present, as required to support the wave. The membrane perturbs the wave in a manner that significantly increases its surface sensitivity. The high surface sensitivity in concert with the ability to create long optical interaction length plasmonic structures leads to high sensitivity (bio)chemical sensors. Theoretical results describing the operation of the structure are given along with experimental results demonstrating the propagation of long-range surface plasmons in air and in liquid. The structure opens up a wealth of opportunities for research and application across many fields, including plasmonics, photonics, material science, surfaces, and solid\u2212liquid interfaces.", "Improved identification of trace organic compounds in complex matrixes is critical for a variety of fields such as material science, heritage science, and forensics. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a vibrational spectroscopy technique that can attain single-molecule sensitivity and has been shown to complement mass spectrometry, but lacks widespread application without a robust method that utilizes the effect. We demonstrate a new, highly sensitive, and widely applicable approach to SERS analysis based on laser ablation in the presence of a tailored plasmonic substrate. We analyze several challenging compounds, including non-water-soluble pigments and dyed leather from an ancient Egyptian chariot, achieving sensitivity as high as 120 amol for a 1:1 signal-to-noise ratio and 5 \u03bcm spatial resolution. This represents orders of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution and sensitivity compared to those of other SERS approaches intended for widespread application, greatly increasing the applicability of SERS.", "Recent emphasis on the science of food and cooking has been observed in our popular literature and media.

For example, as you will see in the article, I suggest that the researcher and student take a bit more care in choosing the samples they wish to photograph for journal submissions or for presentations. It makes more sense to use material that is in good condition. The first-time viewer will see your picture as a whole--imperfections and all--and will not mentally delete the imperfections, as you do. In addition, although many researchers photograph actual samples from their experiments, I've found that samples prepared specifically for the photograph improve the visual expression of the work, resulting in a simpler, clearer representation of the science. Thinking about what to include in that sample (and what is not necessary) will help you determine for yourself which components are essential elements of the experiment and may ultimately clarify your thinking about the science.", "Last month, at Rockefeller University in New York City, a conference was held to explore the idea that all human nature can be examined by the tools of hard science and explained by a body of principles.

Photoluminescence of Te bulk solid crystal was observed at 3.75 \u03bcm in the midwavelength infrared (MWIR) region, matching the theoretically predicted value well. With increasing the photoexcitation intensity or decreasing temperature, we successfully observed MWIR random lasing of the bulk Te crystals at 3.62 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the rod-shaped Te microcrystals efficiently exhibit second harmonic and third harmonic lasing at MWIR and short-wavelength infrared regions, respectively. Nonlinear coherent MWIR lasing from the Te microcrystals will serve as an excellent mid-IR light source, opening up new applications in infrared photonics, extremely long-depth penetration bioimaging, and optoelectronics.", "The accurate electron density and linear optical properties of l-histidinium hydrogen oxalate are discussed.

The refractive indices are computed from couple perturbed Kohn\u2013Sham calculations and measured experimentally. Moreover, distributed atomic polarizabilities are used to analyze the origin of the linear susceptibility in the crystal, in order to separate molecular and intermolecular causes. The optical properties are also correlated with the electron density distribution. This compound also offers the possibility to test the electron density building block approach for material science and different refinement schemes for accurate positions and displacement parameters of hydrogen atoms, in the absence of neutron diffraction data.", "Because of the popularity of shows such as CSI and Cold Case there has been a documented increase in student interest in the sciences. This has been a boon to all of the sciences and brought new life into many programs. Along with the positive effects, however, there have also been some serious negative effects. One of these negatives, called the \"CSI effect\" by many, is that potential jurors have increased\u2014and sometimes wholly unrealistic\u2014expectations of science presented in the courtroom. Unfortunately, the way that forensic science is sometimes presented in the classroom can exacerbate the \"CSI effect\". In some cases, forensic science gets reduced to the equivalent of a standard laboratory exercise: follow these steps to perform this test, compare the results, match one of your results to \"the culprit\". The result is that students may also be getting an unrealistic set of expectations about how real forensic science is performed and a very skewed understanding of scientific methodology. Rather than simply catering to a current trend, this re-awakening of interest in science should be seen as an opportunity to advance understanding of the basic principles of science and critical thinking.", "We report a one-step solvothermal method to prepare magnetic hybrid copolymer\u2013Co hierarchical hollow spheres by localized Ostwald ripening. The initial stage is the aggregation of primary inorganic nanoparticles whose surfaces are partially adsorbed by copolymer PEG\u2013PPG\u2013PEG to form solid spheres followed by hollowing of the core and the progressive matter redistribution from the interior to the exterior. Meanwhile, amorphous inorganic particles grow to cubic crystallites. Finally, a hollow spherical architecture with an extensively roughened surface is obtained by this self-transformation. The effect of NaOH concentration (served as a catalyst and reagent) on the sphere morphology is also checked by time-dependent experiments. When decreasing the mass of NaOH from 7.5 to 2.5 mmol, a morphology transformation from porous hollow spheres to double-wall spheres and then to single-wall spheres with platelet-like building units aligned disorderly on the outer surfaces is observed, and this morphology transformation is related to Ostwald ripening. Our results suggest that these nanoparticle-based hollow hierarchical spheres collected by the self-transformation of precursor objects could be of potential applicability in the fields of material science and biomedical technology.", "Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets, such as graphene and MoS2, which are demonstrated to be fundamentally and technologically important in many applications, have emerged as a unique family of nanomaterials in chemistry and material science over the past decade. The single-crystalline nature and ultrathin thickness of these 2D nanosheets make them ideal templates for the epitaxial deposition of nanostructures, which offer many possibilities to engineer microsized 2D p\u2013n hetero-junctions at atomic/nanometer scale. This Perspective aims to provide information on the epitaxial growth of hetero-nanostructures based on ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Various methods for the epitaxial growth of nanostructures based on ultrathin 2D nanosheets or in situ growth of lateral or vertical epitaxial 2D semiconductor hetero-nanostructures are introduced. The advantages of these 2D epitaxial hetero-nanostructures for some applications, such as electronics, optoelectronics, and electrocatalysis, are also presented. On the basis of the current status of 2D epitaxial hetero-nanostructures, the future prospects of this promising area are discussed.", "Nanotechnology is stimulating the development of nanomanipulators, including tips to interact with individual nanosystems. Fabricating nanotips fulfilling the requirements of shape (size, aspect ratio), mechanical, magnetic, and electrical properties is a material science challenge. Here, we report the generation of reinforced carbon\u2212carbon composite nanotools using a nanotube (CNTs) covered by an amorphous carbon matrix (shell); the CNT tip protruded and remained uncoated to preserve apex size. Unsuitable properties such as flexibility and vibration could be controlled without deteriorating the CNT size, strength, and resilience. Nanomanipulation experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study the mechanical response of these composite beams under bending efforts. AFM probes based on these C\u2212C composite high aspect ratio tips generated excellent image resolution and showed no degradation after acquiring several hundred (400) images.", "With the rise of the internet and ease of access through mobile technology, globalization is occurring at a rate faster than ever before. Employers are increasingly recognizing international experience as added value in job candidates, and many now believe that studying abroad is essential to the education experience. Recognizing the impact a this experience can have on a student\u2019s life, the American Chemical Society has developed relevant programs and activities that promote international experience and global mobility. Two programs are highlighted in this work: International Research Experience for Undergraduates programs (IREU) and ACS International Center\u2122. The ACS International Center (www.acs.org/ic) features listings on more than 350 scientific collaboration and research opportunities from over 100 different funding organizations in 15 different regions worldwide, surpassing any other such database of opportunities in chemistry. Anyone interested can easily search for these opportunities on the International Center website. The ACS IREU program provides talented chemistry and material science students with a cross-cultural experience at the best research laboratories abroad. Reciprocally, it gives international students the opportunity to study at domestic REU sites at U.S. universities. Both programs facilitate global networking and catalyzes international collaborations.", "We report the spontaneous formation of lyotropic liquid crystals from the self-assembly of a series of minimalistic peptides. The highly charged peptides could self-assemble into rigid helical nanofilaments in water and spontaneously order into hexagonal liquid-crystalline phases with interfilament separations of \u2264240 \u00c5. The formation of liquid crystals from the self-assembly of such simple peptides is dictated not only by the concentration and pH but also by the amino acid sequence of the peptides. Peptides containing the rigid Phe-Phe (FF) segment showed much higher propensities to form a liquid-crystalline phase with long-range order. Moreover, because of the intrinsic chirality of the peptides, the self-assembled birefringent liquid crystals could serve as sensing elements for the visual discrimination of chiral species and as templates for the biomimetic synthesis of mesoporous silica with ordered cavities. The results offer new opportunities for the design of peptide liquid crystals that are potentially applicable in sensing, biomedicine, and material science.", "Structural plasticity and its control at the nanoscale are a vivid area of material science. In this contribution, we report a conceptually simple and versatile strategy for the formation of reconfigurable nanoparticle arrangements. The key role in our approach is played by star block copolymers from controlled radical RAFT polymerization, which fulfill the dual task of guiding the particle arrangement and also of equipping the nanomaterials with stimulus-responsiveness. By virtue of their block structure, the star polymers provide at the same time colloidal stability and responsive properties. Structural switching in response to the applied stimulus was investigated by means of small-angle X-ray scattering and dynamic light scattering. The developed approach is general, easy to implement, and may provide new prospects for the development of colloidal actuators, nanoscale materials with switchable properties, and nanoscale machines.", "Dibenzofuran (DBF) is converted to a vacuum-sublimable, electron-transporting host material via 2,8-substitution with diphenylphosphine oxide moieties. Close \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking and the inductive influence of PO moieties impart favorable electron-transport properties without lowering the triplet energy. A maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.1% and luminance power efficiency of 25.9 lm/W are realized using this material as the host for the blue-green electrophosphorescent molecule, iridium(III) bis(4,6-(di-fluorophenyl)pyridinato-N,C2\u2018)picolinate (FIrpic).", "Modern analytical methods play an important role in chemistry, physics, and material science. Often, the results of many experiments can neither be interpreted nor important questions answered applying only one method. Providing a good chemical education thus entails incorporating as many modern analytical methods as possible in the curriculum.\nTo address this need we developed and implemented a compulsory two-week graduate course with theoretical lectures, practical exercises, and discussions. Students worked on a solid state analytical problem, the thermal behavior of CuSO4\u20225H2O, which could only be solved using several different analytical methods. By the end of the course the students learned both the logistics of solving such problems and which methods supply the appropriate solutions based on knowledge of the advantages and limitations of each method and a critical view of the results obtained by these methods.", "Understanding the diffusion of gold nanorods (AuNRs) and their composites in dispersion is important at fundamental level and in fields as diverse as material science, nanobiotechnology to drug delivery. The translational and rotational diffusion of AuNRs decorated with thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) brushes having hydrophilic and hydrophobic end groups was investigated in the dilute regime by dynamic light scattering. The same series of functionalized AuNRs were studied in the isotropic concentrated dispersions by high-resolution NMR diffusometry. The dependence of translational and rotational diffusivity upon molecular weight and polymer end group were measured as a function of temperature in the region of the brush phase transition. The effective hydrodynamic radius of AuNR composites proved to be the most sensitive quantity to the temperature-induced phase transition of brushes, allowing the evaluation of the brush thickness in the swollen and collapsed states.", "Controlling the pinning of organic droplets on solid surfaces is of fundamental and practical interest in the field of material science and engineering, which has numerous applications such as surface cleaning, water treatment, and microfluidics. Here, a rapid in situ control of pinning and actuation of organic droplets is demonstrated on dodecylbenzenesulfonate-doped polypyrrole (PPy(DBS)) surfaces in an aqueous environment via an electrochemical redox process. A dramatic change of the pinning results from the transport of DBS\u2013 molecules between the PPy(DBS) surface and the aqueous environment, as well as from a simultaneous alternation of the surface oleophobicity to organic liquids during the redox process. This in situ control of the droplet pinning enables a stop-and-go droplet actuation, applicable to both polar and apolar organic droplets, at low voltages (\u223c0.9 V) with an extremely low roll-off angle (\u223c0.4\u00b0).", "Why is chemistry the forgotten science?\nDespite the fact that chemistry is the central science, the science that has had more of an impact on humanity than all other sciences combined, it has never produced a chronicler of the likes of Lewis Thomas, or Stephen Jay Gould, or Carl Sagan, or Stephen Hawking. Nor has chemistry attracted the attention it deserves by science writers from the general media.\nThe media's perception of chemistry was the topic of a symposium sponsored by the Younger Chemists Committee at the ACS national meeting in Anaheim. This reporter was invited to participate in the symposium to address the media's indifference toward chemistry.\nIn some ways, chemistry is a victim of its own success. Chemistry suffers to some extent because a chemist's work is often a means to an end\u2014a particular compound or material.

The focus of this attention is a collection of 1500 presentations in more than 100 special sessions at five hotels in Philadelphia by more than 40 different organizations and 20 subsections of the meeting's sponsor, the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nThe annual AAAS meeting has emerged in the past few years as the premier public forum of science in the U.S. Somehow, the welter of speeches, slides, sound tracks, panels, and audience reaction has gelled into the broadest three-dimensional outline of current science to reach public view. This result has not been achieved without considerable effort.\nUnder meeting editor Walter G. Berl, AAAS has checked the sprawl of specialized new material and selected symposium topics to cover all natural ...", "Building complex nanostructures using a simple patterned template is challenging in material science and nanotechnology. In the present work, three different strategies have been exploited for the successful fabrication of hybrid dots-on-wire metallic nanostructures through combining an in-situ method with an ex-situ method. Basically, plasma etching was applied to generate a metallic wire-like nanostructure, and preformed nanoparticles could be placed through multiple means before or after the formation of the wire-like nanostructure. Various monometallic and bimetallic nanostructures have been obtained by utilizing only one functional domain of block copolymer templates. In these cases, full utilization of the functional domain or introduction of the molecular linker is critical to engineering hybrid metallic nanostructures. Other complex and multifunctional hybrid nanostructures can be developed via these strategies similarly, and these nanostructures are promising for useful applications such as optics and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).", "The editors of Scientific American have collaborated with, their scientist authors to edit and arrange original magazine articles of the past seven years under five broad subjects. The enterprise has been reasonably successful. Even though a single chapter may consist of five sections by as many writers, there is sufficient continuity and no great excess of repetition. Naturally all the material is presented for the general reader who wants to keep up with the advances of science. But the scientist who wants to keep abreast of developments in other fields than his own will not feel that his intelligence is being insulted.\nThe quality of the writing varies. Some of the authors have a particular gift for clarity and some are skillful in making their material entertaining as well as informative. Others test the reader's endurance by dull prose.

The widely studied carbon material now shares that distinction with boron nitride, according to researchers in Germany ( Nano Lett., DOI: 10.1021/nl9011497).\nScientists had long predicted that single-atom-thick sheets of materials like graphene would spontaneously roll up into tubes or other curved structures if, indeed, the superthin films could be formed at all.\nJust a few years ago, however, researchers showed that not only is it possible to separate atom-thick sheets of graphene from graphite, but it\u2019s also easy to do. That discovery touched off an explosion of studies that uncovered outstanding and potentially useful mechanical, electronic, and chemical properties of the thinnest material (C&EN, March 2, page 14). Now, atom-thick boron nitride films may be poised to share the spotlight with graphene.\nMany other types of atom-thick monolayers have been grown on solid supports. But unlike graphene, other films generally cannot be ...", "Determining the manner in which crystal structures are formed is considered a great mystery within materials science. Potential solutions have the possibility to be uncovered by revealing hidden patterns within the material data. Data science is therefore implemented in order to link the material data to the crystal structure. In particular, unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques are used where the Gaussian mixture model is employed in order to understand the data structure of the materials database while random forest classification is used to predict the crystal structure. As a result, the unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques reveal descriptors for determining the crystal structure via the materials database. In addition, predicting atomic combinations from the crystal structure is also achieved using a trained machine where the first-principles calculations confirm the stability of predicted materials. Thus, one can consider that the estimation of the crystal structure can be achieved in principle via the combination of material data and machine learning, thereby leading to the advancement of crystal structure prediction.", "Efficient photoisomerization of chromophores is important in living systems, and structural constraints of protein pocket on chromophores are the probable reason for moving their dynamic reaction equilibrium forward. On the other hand, photochemical reaction to switch a molecule from one isomer to the other with different geometry and property in a high yield will continue to play a vital role in the synthetic chemistry and material science. Because of the important role of efficient photoisomerization, a biomimetic approach for \u201cseeing\u201d and controlling the photoisomerization is developed by using the technology of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) with supramolecular chemistry. It is revealed that a (Z)-isomer of a 2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone-containing tetraphenylethene (TPE-UPy) can be photoisomerized into supramolecular polymer form of its (E)-counterpart in chloroform in a high reaction yield of 68.1%. The yield is further enhanced to 100% in THF as aggregates of supramolecular polymers of (E)-TPE-UPy are formed, which completely inhibits the reverse photoreaction to form (Z)-TPE-UPy. In chloroform with organic acid, a mixture of equal amounts of (E)- and (Z)-isomers was obtained due to the disruption of the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The AIE characteristics of the isomers allow us to directly \u201csee\u201d the \u201cturn-on\u201d photoisomerization process by distinct fluorescence color changes, and the photoisomerization observed here may enable the development of a promising generation of optical power limiting materials.", "This article reviews chemistry-related articles published in The Science Teacher between September 2005 and February 2006. Lab safety, inquiry-based activities, flame tests, designing safe lab facilities, interdisciplinary chemistry teaching, radioisotopic half-lives, science and literacy, and a Science Safety Index are all part of TST reviewed articles recently published. References to related JCE articles are included in the review.", "We describe the fluidFM, an atomic force microscope (AFM) based on hollow cantilevers for local liquid dispensing and stimulation of single living cells under physiological conditions. A nanofluidic channel in the cantilever allows soluble molecules to be dispensed through a submicrometer aperture in the AFM tip. The sensitive AFM force feedback allows controlled approach of the tip to a sample for extremely local modification of surfaces in liquid environments. It also allows reliable discrimination between gentle contact with a cell membrane or its perforation. Using these two procedures, dyes have been introduced into individual living cells and even selected subcellular structures of these cells. The universality and versatility of the fluidFM will stimulate original experiments at the submicrometer scale not only in biology but also in physics, chemistry, and material science.", "Recently, we have introduced a new method, metadynamics, which is able to sample rarely occurring transitions and to reconstruct the free energy as a function of several variables with a controlled accuracy. This method has been successfully applied in many different fields, ranging from chemistry to biophysics and ligand docking and from material science to crystal structure prediction. We present an important development that speeds up metadynamics calculations by orders of magnitude and renders the algorithm much more robust. We use multiple interacting simulations, walkers, for exploring and reconstructing the same free energy surface. Each walker contributes to the history-dependent potential that, in metadynamics, is an estimate of the free energy. We show that the error on the reconstructed free energy does not depend on the number of walkers, leading to a fully linear scaling algorithm even on inexpensive loosely coupled clusters of PCs. In addition, we show that the accuracy and stability of the method are much improved by combining it with a weighted histogram analysis. We check the validity of our new method on a realistic application.", "Nowadays, new emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials have become a hot topic in the field of theoretical physics, material science, and nanotechnology engineering due to their high surface area, planar structure, and quantum confinement effect. Within a two-dimensional framework, we systematically concentrate on the buckled and puckered systems consisting of the VA group elements (denoted as arsenene, antimonene, and bismuthene). Among these studied systems, the buckled antimonene harbors a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 2.15 at room temperature. This is probably the highest value that has ever been reported in pristine 2D materials. By simple biaxial strain engineering, the ZT can even get enhanced to 2.9 under 3% tensile strain. The enhancement mainly results from both tuning the electronic structures and reducing the thermal conductance. This work predicts a new promising candidate in thermoelectric devices, based on the fact that buckled antimonene has been lately fabricated and proved to be stable at ambient conditions.", "The ability to precisely control the pattern of different metals at the micro- and nanoscale, along with their topology, has been demonstrated to be essential for many applications, ranging from material science to biomedical devices, electronics, and photonics. In this work, we show a novel approach, based on a combination of lithographic techniques and galvanic displacement reactions, to fabricate micro- and nanoscale patterns of different metals, with highly controlled surface roughness, onto a number of suitable substrates. We demonstrate the possibility to exploit such metal films to achieve significant fluorescence enhancement of nearby fluorophores, while maintaining accurate spatial control of the process, from submicron resolution to centimeter-sized features. These patterns may be also exploited for a wide range of applications, including SERS, solar cells, DNA microarray technology, hydrophobic/hydrophilic substrates, and magnetic devices.", 0, "The construction of multicomponent hybrid nanomaterials with well-controlled architecture, especially bearing an ordered homogeneity and distribution of the subunits with tunable functions, is a key challenge in chemistry and material science. Herein, we reported a versatile and novel strategy to fabricate core\u2013satellite multicomponent nanostructures with tunable interparticle distances and catalysis properties by the combination of surface-initiated reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer (SI-RAFT) polymerization and self-assembly. The arrangement and interparticle distance of gold satellites could be precisely tuned by the SI-RAFT polymerization process and the feeding ratio of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and the core nanoparticle. It is worth to note that multilayered core\u2013satellite nanostructures have been fabricated by a high-feeding ratio of AuNPs and magnetite NP (MNP)@SiO2\u2013PNIPAm. Notably, the core\u2013satellite MNP@SiO2\u2013PNIPAm\u2013Au nanoparticles exhibited excellent thermoresponsive behaviors with the change of temperature. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of MNP@SiO2\u2013PNIPAm\u2013Au nanoparticles via the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol can be well modulated by the nanoparticle size, temperature, and polymer feed ratio. This strategy for precise construction of core\u2013satellite nanostructures would open a new pathway to construct multicomponent functional nanostructures.", "We report a switchable redox click and cleave reaction strategy for conjugating and releasing a range of molecules on demand. This chemoselective redox-responsive ligation (CRRL) and release strategy is based on a redox switchable oxime linkage that is controlled by mild chemical or electrochemical redox signals and can be performed at physiological conditions without the use of a catalyst. Both conjugation and release reactions are kinetically well behaved and quantitative. The CRRL strategy is synthetically modular and easily monitored and characterized by routine analytical techniques. We demonstrate how the CRRL strategy can be used for the dynamic generation of cyclic peptides and the ligation of two different peptides that are stable but can be selectively cleaved upon changes in the redox environment. We also demonstrate a new redox based delivery of cargoes to live cells strategy via the CRRL methodology by synthesizing a FRET redox-responsive probe that is selectively activated within a cellular environment. We believe the ease of the CRRL strategy should find wide use in a range of applications in biology, tissue engineering, nanoscience, synthetic chemistry, and material science and will expand the suite of current conjugation and release strategies.", "Organofluorine compounds are becoming increasingly important in different fields, such as material science, agro chemistry, and the pharmaceutical industry. Nucleophilic trifluoromethylation is one of the widely used methods to incorporate a trifluoromethyl moiety into organic molecules. We have carried out extensive studies to develop varieties of easily accessible nucleophilic catalysts to promote such reactions. TMS-protected trifluoromethylated alcohols were prepared from both aldehydes and ketones in excellent yields using catalytic amount of amine N-oxide. Carbonate and phosphate salts also showed efficient catalytic activity toward this reaction. These reactions were highly solvent dependent, and DMF was found to be the most suitable one among the various solvents studied. All these reactions proceeded under very mild conditions, giving clean products and avoiding the use of any fluoride initiators or expensive catalysts, and extremely water-free conditions. The mechanism for the reaction is discussed in detail. DFT calculations were performed on the possible reaction intermediates using the Gaussian 03 program at B3LYP/6-311+G* level to support the proposed mechanism.", "Efficient photoisomerization of chromophores is important in living systems, and structural constraints of protein pocket on chromophores are the probable reason for moving their dynamic reaction equilibrium forward.

Although some conceptions of data science focus primarily on analytical methods, data scientists must also have a deep understanding of how project data were collected, preprocessed and transformed. These processes strongly influence the analytical methods that can be applied, and more importantly how the results of those methods should be interpreted. In the present chapter we provide background information on educational challenges for data scientists and report on the results of a workshop where experts from the information field brainstormed on the educational dimensions of data science. Results of the workshop showed that data scientists must possess a breadth of expertise across three areas \u2013 curation, analytics, and cyber-infrastructure \u2013 with deep knowledge in at least one of these areas. Workshop participants also underscored the importance of domain knowledge to the success of the data science role.

Magnetic field effects (MFEs) studied herein are phenomena in which the exciplex emission from an electron donor\u2013acceptor dyad increases or decreases by applying an external magnetic field. The characteristic dependence of MFEs on the viscosity and polarity of the surrounding medium has been applied to investigate the local environments around the probe molecule. In this study, a novel MFE-based fluorescence microscopy technique was developed to explore the structural dynamics of lipid bilayer membranes. The vesicle formation during the membrane deformation was selectively visualized through the MFEs, thus allowing the extraction of information on the cellular dynamics at high temporal and spatial resolutions. This highly versatile and powerful technique is applicable to a wide range of areas, such as biology and material science.", "Limitations in the methods employed to generate micrometric colloidal droplets hinder the emergence of key applications in the fields of material science and drug delivery. Through the use of dedicated nanofluidic devices and by taking advantage of an original physical effect called capillary focusing, we could circumvent some of these limitations. The nanofluidic (i.e., submicrometric) devices introduced herein are made of soft materials, and their fabrication relies upon rapid technologies. The objects that we have generated are simple droplets, multiple droplets, particles, and Janus particles whose sizes lie between 900 nm and 3 \u03bcm (i.e., within the colloidal range). Colloidal droplets have been assembled on-chip into clusters and crystals, yielding discrete diffraction patterns. We illustrate potential applications in the field of drug delivery by demonstrating the ability of multiple droplets to be phagocytosed by murine macrophage-type cells.", "Currently, there are no examples of transformation of endohedral C60 complexes, which result in a chemical reaction between the encapsulated molecule and the carbon cage. Such reactions open new opportunities for producing the poorly studied endohedral covalent derivatives of C60, which may be of great interest for fullerene chemistry and material science. In the present work, we have performed accurate theoretical study on the compression of the recently synthesized H2O@C60 endofullerene. Calculations show that inner-cavity chemical reaction C60 + H2O can take place if H2O@C60 is compressed in the direction of two opposite pentagons. In the case of hexagon-to-hexagon compression, there is no chemical reaction, and relaxation of the compressed structure leads to the original H2O@C60. Though the calculated heat effect of the mentioned chemical transformation is endothermic, the product of the reaction is a minimum on potential energy surface.", "The preparation, structure, dynamic behavior in solution, and reactivity of polyhydride complexes of platinum group metals, described during the last three decades, are contextualized from both organometallic and coordination chemistry points of view. These compounds, which contain dihydrogen, elongated dihydrogen, compressed dihydride, and classical dihydride ligands promote the activation of B\u2013H, C\u2013H, Si\u2013H, N\u2013H, O\u2013H, C\u2013C, C\u2013N, and C\u2013F, among other \u03c3-bonds. In this review, it is shown that, unlike other more mature areas, the chemistry of polyhydrides offers new exciting conceptual challenges and at the same time the possibility of interacting with other fields including the conversion and storage of regenerative energy, organic synthetic chemistry, drug design, and material science. This wide range of possible interactions foresees promising advances in the near future.", "Ab initio computation of molecular properties is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. While this problem is widely believed to be intractable for classical computers, efficient quantum algorithms exist which have the potential to vastly accelerate research throughput in fields ranging from material science to drug discovery. Using a solid-state quantum register realized in a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond, we compute the bond dissociation curve of the minimal basis helium hydride cation, HeH+. Moreover, we report an energy uncertainty (given our model basis) of the order of 10\u201314 hartree, which is 10 orders of magnitude below the desired chemical precision. As NV centers in diamond provide a robust and straightforward platform for quantum information processing, our work provides an important step toward a fully scalable solid-state implementation of a quantum chemistry simulator.", "Tubular materials formed by self-assembly of small organic molecules find great utility in chemical and material science. Conventional tubular structures often lack stability because noncovalent molecular interactions are responsible for their conformational integrities. Herein we report the development of covalently linked chromogenic organic nanotubes which are prepared by using topochemical polymerization of self-assembled macrocyclic diacetylenes (MCDAs). Crystal structures of five MCDAs having different diameters were elucidated, and four of these substances were transformed to tubular polydiacetylenes (PDA) by UV-induced polymerization. Surprisingly, MCDA-1 was found to self-assemble in stacks with a tilt angle of 62.1\u00b0, which significantly deviates from the optimal value for polymerization of 45\u00b0. This observation suggests that geometric parameters derived using linear diacetylene (DA) models might not be strictly applicable to polymerization of MCDA systems. Blue-phase PDAs obtained by polymerization of MCDA-1 and MCDA-3 have different thermochromic and solvatochromic properties, which enable them to be utilized for colorimetric differentiation of aromatic solvents including isomeric xylenes. The observations made and information obtained in this study should enhance the understanding and design of stimulus-responsive rigid organic nanotubes.", "Within the framework of the Lisbon Agreement, all European member states are encouraged to take measures to increase the number of science and technology students in higher education. To promote this educational model, a chemistry project was developed that focuses on high school students and especially on the involvement of their teachers by inviting both groups to attend science outreach programs at Hasselt University.", "Recent decades have brought about dramatic changes in the interests of chemical researchers. Interdisciplinary areas of chemistry such as environmental chemistry, polymer science, and material science have become important parts of the undergraduate curriculum. However, introduction of these multidisciplinary areas into classical chemistry curricula often requires acquisition of specialized analytical equipment. At the same time, more traditional characterization techniques such as polarimetry have been replaced by the routine use of FT-IR and GC-MS techniques in undergraduate organic chemistry laboratories. While such classical instruments remain serviceable, they have in many cases fallen into disuse. Here we describe a simple method whereby a polarimeter is converted into a contact angle goniometer.\nContact angle goniometry is an example of a traditional analytical tool that would be an asset to any physical chemistry training and that would still be of relevance to many interdisciplinary areas. Such instrumentation provides a simple and inexpensive way to introduce and measure fundamental properties such as the surface tension of a variety of materials including metals and polymers. Contact angle measurements are indispensable in the study of adhesion, wettability, and liquid thermodynamics (1 - 3). Many experiments using such measurements can be devised for traditional physical chemistry laboratory sequences. The concept of surface energy is important in materials science, chemistry, and physics. Thus it could not only enhance students' learning but also provide them with new perspective on the fascinating field of surface chemistry and physics.", "Steroid Chemistry Developing Into Specialized Science\nLONDON.\u2014Steroid organic chemistry is developing into a specialized science in its own right, said G. F. Marrian, Edinburgh, in his summary remarks at the close of the symposium on adrenal cortical steroids held in the Ciba Foundation here July 7 to 10. There was justification of such an impression during this meeting which attracted chemists from six countries to discuss the more important developments.\nThe ergosterol route to adrenal cortical hormones was discussed by E. R. H. Jones, Manchester, who used the 5-a: 8-a epidioxide of dehydroergosterol as a starting material. This necessitated a study of partial hydrogenation methods which would enable the side-chain double bond to be retained until reaching an appropriate stage.\nH. Heusser, Zurich, described several routes by which oxygen functions could be introduced at C-ll into steroidal 7:9 (ll)-dienes of different series.

Therefore, strong light\u2013matter interaction is induced by the near-field enhancement effects of LSPRs. Because the resonant wavelength of LSPRs can be easily controlled by the size and shape of the metallic nanoparticles in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range, LSPRs have received considerable attention as optical antennae for light energy conversion systems such as solar cells. LSPRs decay very quickly as a result of light scattering and excitation of electron\u2013hole pairs in the metal itself. However, in addition to the near-field enhancement effect, this light scattering and electron\u2013hole pair excitation, which are known to cause loss of LSPRs, can be utilized as a solar cell enhancement mechanism. Here, we focus on plasmonic solid-state solar cells. The mechanisms of the light scattering by LSPRs, near-field enhancement, and plasmon-induced charge separation based on electron\u2013hole pair excitations can be clarified. We review the related studies from the viewpoint of these mechanisms rather than material science.", "In this paper, we report for the first time formation of novel manganese monocarbide (MnC) using laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LHDAC). The synthesis was carried out at high pressure\u2013high temperature (HPHT) and subsequently quenched to ambient condition. The formation and reproducibility have been confirmed in the pressure range of 4.7 to 9.2 GPa. Employing contribution of different probes viz.X-ray diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and ab initio electronic structure calculation, the structure of MnC was found to be ZnS type i.e. a cubic lattice with a = 4.4294(2) \u00c5. The bulk modulus has been determined to be 170(5) GPa from in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HPXRD). Hardness of ZnS type MnC is estimated from an empirical relation to be about 40 GPa, making it a potential superhard material.", "Ostwald ripening is an important growth process in many scientific disciplines ranging from material science, geology, biophysics, and product formulation. Here ripening of argon clusters in a vapor phase is observed directly in constant energy molecular dynamics simulations serving as a model system for large-time scale ripening processes. Starting from an initial metastable equilibrium between the vapor phase and two clusters Ostwald ripening is initiated by the addition of kinetic energy. This mimics local thermal fluctuations in a larger system. It appears that there is not necessarily a close encounter of two clusters before ripening sets in. Also no static density bridge between two ripening clusters is observed. The onset of ripening is rather related to the different evaporation dynamics of clusters of different size. It can start at the moment energy is added or with some delay, depending on the difference in cluster size and dynamics.", "In the context of emerging methods to control particle organization in particle\u2013matrix composite materials, we explore, using finite element analysis, how to modulate the material bulk mechanical stiffness. Compared to a composite containing randomly distributed particles, material stiffness is enhanced 100-fold when filler particles are aligned into linear chains lying parallel to the loading direction. In contrast, chains aligned perpendicular to that direction produce negligible stiffness change. These outcomes reveal how zigzag chains, which provide intermediate results, can modulate stiffness. The stiffness decreases gradually with increasing zigzag angle \u03b8 over a range spanning 2 orders of magnitude.", "The author justifies the teaching of science.", "Recently, DNA molecules have received great attention because of their potential applications in material science.

In both cases, the excitation energy does not differ significantly from that of isolated cytosine or protonated cytosine, indicating that the excitation takes place on the DNA base. However, the excited-state lifetime of the C2H+ (\u03c4 = 85 fs), estimated from the bandwidth of the spectrum, is at least 2 orders of magnitude shorter than that of the C2Ag+ (\u03c4 > 5000 fs).

Graphene oxide (GO)-based sensors and catalysts have been considered as a promising candidate in current material science research. However, the sensing and catalytic properties of GO also need to be further improved to satisfy the specific applications, such as gas detection in harsh environments, medical diagnosis based on human breath, blood glucose detection, catalytic activity, and so forth. Therefore, the effect of nitrogen in GO on the performance of glucose and ammonia sensing, and catalytic activity has been investigated. Herein, we propose a practical, high-sensitive sensor and catalyst based on high-quality defect N-enriched GO. One-step, low-cost solvothermal synthesis of N-enriched GO has been exploited for the development of high-performance sensors and excellent catalyst at room temperature. The resultant N-enriched GO (N8GO) has been studied as a promising sensing material for ammonia, glucose, and para-nitrophenol (PNP) reduction. The prevalent outstanding sensing and catalytic performance may be due to the synergistic effect of nitrogen. A probable mechanism for sensing and catalytic reduction of PNP using N8GO has been proposed.", "In the context of emerging methods to control particle organization in particle\u2013matrix composite materials, we explore, using finite element analysis, how to modulate the material bulk mechanical stiffness.

The real spread and success of this expectation will be strictly linked to different factors, among which a fundamental one will be the capacity of simulations of (supra)molecular systems to include environment effects. It is in fact well-known that molecular responses and processes are strongly affected or, in some cases, completely determined by the surrounding environment (either a solvent, a protein, a membrane, a polymer, or a composite matrix). This Perspective highlights recent achievements and suggests possible future developments of one of the most popular approaches to include environmental effects in molecular calculations, the continuun solvation model.", "The self-assembly of anisotropic nanoparticles (ANPs) possesses a wide array of potential applications in various fields, ranging from nanotechnology to material science. Despite intense research of the thermodynamic self-assembly of ANPs, elucidating their nonequilibrium behaviors under confinement still remains an urgent issue. Here, by performing simulation and theoretical justification, we present for the first time a study of the shear-induced behaviors of Janus spheres (the most elementary ANPs) confined in two-dimensional space. Our results demonstrate that the collective effects of shear and bonding structures can give rise to reshaped cluster configurations, featured by the chiral transition of clusters. Scaling analysis and numerical modeling are performed to quantitatively capture the assembling kinetics of dispersed Janus spheres, thereby suggesting an exotic way to bridge the gap between anisotropic and isotropic particles. The findings highlight confinement and shearing engineering as a versatile strategy to tailor the superstructures formed by ANPs toward unique properties.", "Global science is paying increasingly urgent attention to sustainability challenges, as evidenced by initiatives such as the working group determining whether Earth has moved from the Holocene to the Anthropocene Epoch on the geologic time scale and the interdisciplinary efforts to define and quantify our planetary boundaries. Despite the fact that much of the scientific work underlying these initiatives is based on measurements of fundamental chemistry parameters, sustainability literacy has not been incorporated in any systematic way into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. We report here on the philosophy and implementation of a NSF-funded initiative, Visualizing the Chemistry of Climate Change (VC3), which provides an exemplar for developing strategies to fill that gap, focusing on climate change, one of the defining sustainability challenges of the 21st century. VC3 targets the strategic first year university and college chemistry courses that are common to the program requirements of many science and engineering majors. The overall goals of the VC3 project are to infuse climate literacy principles into the learning of representative core topics in North American general chemistry courses for science majors, while demonstrating that learning core chemistry topics by starting with an important rich context is a viable approach.", "Economical and abundant natural biological materials provide a low-cost and scalable approach to develop next-generation flexible and wearable electronics. Herein, a universal strategy of nature-inspired and amine-promoted metallization, namely, NIAPM, is presented to make high-quality metals for electronics fabrication. The introduction of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) significantly shortens the time of metallization from >48 h to \u22486 h, and the phenol compounds (TP) from green tea make metals bond tightly on all demonstrated surfaces. The as-made thin metal films of Cu and Ni feature high conductivity (\u223c1.0 \u03a9/\u25a1), excellent mechanical stability and flexibility even at the bending radius of \u223c1 mm. Moreover, NIAPM is compatible with typical lithography techniques for fabricating metallic patterns, showing considerable potential applications in flexible electronics. As a proof-of-concept, two devices based on melamine-templated Cu sponges are first prepared for detecting the change of external pressure with a resistance sensitivity of 18.1 kPa\u20131 and collecting high-viscosity crude oil, respectively. Then, a high-performance bendable solid supercapacitor is demonstrated using as-prepared Ni metallized fabrics and the activated porous carbon from the recycled waste in NIPAM as flexible electrodes, which possesses comparable areal capacitance of 45.5 F\u00b7g\u20131, and energy density of 7.88 Wh\u00b7g\u20131 at the power density of 35 W\u00b7g\u20131.

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a hydrophobic silicon-based rubber, is polymerized and molded onto templates of varying roughnesses and textures to introduce topology that changes surface hydrophilicity. The topological changes are assessed through optical microscopy imaging, and the wettability is analyzed by measuring the contact angle using an inexpensive digital camera. The molds are treated with boiling water which generates hydroxyl groups on the surface. Successful chemical modification of the polymer surface is confirmed using attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) analysis, and wettability is assessed through contact angle measurement. Postlab questions focus on the wettability of the physically and chemically modified surfaces and their potential use as scaffolding for tissue engineering. This adaptable experiment is designed to reinforce concepts such as intermolecular forces, introduce polymer structure and synthesis, showcase polymer applications in biological research, and provide an introduction to surface wettability in a visually interesting manner.", "The Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics & Space Administration are both quite interested in replacing mechanical fastenings with adhesive bonds because of potential savings in weight and manufacturing costs.\nSuch bonds have proved to be quite reliable under favorable conditions.

Thin film Fe\u2013V\u2013O materials libraries were synthesized using combinatorial reactive magnetron cosputtering and subsequent annealing in air. The design of the libraries comprises a combination of large compositional gradients (from Fe10V90Ox to Fe79V21Ox) and thickness gradients (from 140 to 425 nm). These material libraries were investigated by high-throughput characterization techniques in terms of composition, structure, optical, and photoelectrochemical properties to establish correlations between composition, thickness, crystallinity, microstructure, and photocurrent density. Results show the presence of the Fe2V4O13 phase from \u223c11 to 42 at. % Fe (toward low-Fe region) and the FeVO4 phase from \u223c37 to 79 at. % Fe (toward Fe-rich region). However, as a third phase, Fe2O3 is present throughout the compositional gradients (from low-Fe to Fe-rich region). Material compositions with increasing crystallinity of the FeVO4 phase show enhanced photocurrent densities (\u223c160 to 190 \u03bcA/cm2) throughout the thickness gradients whereas compositions with the Fe2V4O13 phase show comparatively low photocurrent densities (\u223c28 \u03bcA/cm2). The band gap energies of Fe\u2013V\u2013O films were inferred from Tauc plots. The highest photocurrent density of \u223c190 \u03bcA/cm2 was obtained for films with \u223c54 to 66 at. % Fe for the FeVO4 phase with \u223c2.04 eV for the indirect and \u223c2.80 eV for the direct band gap energies.", "A FAMILY OF COMPOUNDS endowed with a property that enables them to be switched between two magnetic states may form the basis of future high-density data-storage technologies, according to researchers in Italy and Germany.

The objectives of this study were, first, to perform a systematic and ultrastructural investigation of the initial mineral formation during secondary ossification center of mouse femur based on material science and biology viewpoint, and then develop novel biomaterials for mineralization based on the in vivo findings. First, we identified the very initial mineral deposition at postnatal day 5 (P5) at the medial side of femur epiphysis by nanocomputed tomography. Initial minerals were found in the surroundings of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Interestingly, histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed that initial mineralization until P6 was based on chondrocyte activity only, i.e., it occurred in the absence of osteoblasts. Moreover, electron microscopy-based ultrastructural analysis showed that cell-secreted matrix vesicles were absent in the early steps of osteoblast-independent endochondral ossification. Instead, chondrocyte membrane nanofragments were found in the fibrous matrix surrounding the hypertrophic chondrocytes. EDS analysis and electron diffraction study indicated that cell membrane nanofragments were not mineralized material, and could be the nucleation site for the newly formed calcospherites. The phospholipids in the cell membrane nanofragments could be a source of phosphate for subsequent calcium phosphate formation, which initially was amorphous, and later transformed into apatite crystals. Finally, artificial cell nanofragments were synthesized from ATDC5 chondrogenic cells, and in vitro assays showed that these nanofragments could promote mineral formation. Taken together, these results indicated that cell membrane nanofragments were the nucleation site for mineral formation, and could potentially be used as material for manipulation of biomineralization.", "Considers what value the teaching of science and history may be to one another.", "Communication and assessment of scientific information is as important as the science itself, especially when policy-makers, politicians, and media specialists lack scientific backgrounds.

A sodium dithionate initiated polymerization of perfluorodiiodides and dienes allows for high-molecular-weight polymers (>100 kDa) to be prepared in the presence of oxygen and water with up to 59 wt % fluorine content. These conditions are sufficiently mild to enable the polymerization of functional dienes, leading to biodegradable fluoropolymers. The iodo\u2013ene polymerization results in the addition of polarizable iodine atoms, which improve polymer processability; yet, these atoms can be removed after processing for enhanced stability. Displacement of the iodine atoms with thiols or azides facilitates covalent surface modification and cross-linking.

Their study typically involves the application of a large toolbox of spectroscopic and imaging techniques. However, quite often, the structural aspects remain underexposed. Besides, molecular modeling of the self-assembly process is usually difficult to handle, since a vast conformational space has to be sampled. Here, we have used an approach that combines short molecular dynamics simulations for peptide dimerization and NMR restraints to build a model of the supramolecular structure from the dimeric units. Experimental NMR data notably provide crucial information about the conformation of the monomeric units, the supramolecular assembly dimensions, and the orientation of the individual peptides within the assembly. This in silico/in vitro mixed approach enables us to define accurate atomistic models of supramolecular structures of the bacterial cyclic lipodepsipeptide pseudodesmin A.", "The role of the helicity of small molecules in enantioselective catalysis, molecular recognition, self-assembly, material science, biology, and nanoscience is much less understood than that of point-, axial-, or planar-chiral molecules. To uncover the envisaged potential of helically chiral polyaromatics represented by iconic helicenes, their availability in an optically pure form through asymmetric synthesis is urgently needed. We provide a solution to this problem present since the birth of helicene chemistry in 1956 by developing a general synthetic methodology for the preparation of uniformly enantiopure fully aromatic [5]-, [6]-, and [7]helicenes and their functionalized derivatives. [2 + 2 + 2] Cycloisomerization of chiral triynes combined with asymmetric transformation of the first kind (ultimately controlled by the 1,3-allylic-type strain) is central to this endeavor. The point-to-helical chirality transfer utilizing a traceless chiral auxiliary features a remarkable resistance to diverse structural perturbations.", "A new linear-scaling method based on a multigrid approach to treat long-range electrostatic interactions in hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations is described. The scheme has been implemented in the context of a QM calculation based on density functional theory (DFT). The method is tested on an analytical model to validate the new algorithm. Two realistic problems in \u03b1-quartz crystals and a zwitterionic dipeptide (GLY-ALA) in water have been chosen as further tests. Results from QM/MM calculations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) show that the use of PBC is essential when studying highly ordered crystal structures, unless a carefully designed MM crystal is used for the calculation. With a general shaped MM subsystem, the absence of PBC leads to an incorrect description of Kohn\u2212Sham band gaps and charge density.

Among the many stimuli to alter the isomerization into the merocyanine (MC) isomer, such as temperature, pH, solvent polarity, redox potential, or mechanical force, the ability of the MC form to act as a ligand site for metal complexation has recently raised new attention. We herein synthesize hitherto undescribed coordination compounds of 8-methoxy-1\u2032,3\u2032,3\u2032-trimethyl-6-nitrospiro-[chromene-2,2\u2032-indoline] with s-block ([Ca(MC)4](ClO4)2), d-block ([Zn(MC)2(MeCN)2](ClO4)2, [Ni(MC)2(MeCN)2](ClO4)2), as well as f-block ([La(NO3)3(MC)2]) metals. All complexes are structurally described by X-ray crystallography and systematically investigated in solution via Job\u2019s method of continuous variations (Job plots), as well as online NMR spectroscopic kinetic experiments with in situ irradiation of the analyte solution inside the NMR spectrometer (LED-NMR). We can unambiguously identify the photoresponsive nature of the complexes in solution, which is a crucial step toward the application of these promising molecules in material science.", "Holograms record and display realistic images that appear to float over a surface.

Direct visualization of atomic diffusion process in ultrahigh vacuum in situ TEM could comprehend the fundamental information about metal\u2013semiconductor interface dynamics, phase transitions, and different nanostructure growth phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the in situ TEM observations of the complete replacement of ZnO nanowire by indium with different growth directions. In situ TEM analyses reveal that the diffusion processes strongly depend and are dominated by the interface dynamics between indium and ZnO. The diffusion exhibited a distinct ledge migration by surface diffusion at [001]-ZnO while continuous migration with slight/no ledges by inner diffusion at [100]-ZnO. The process is explained based on thermodynamic evaluation and growth kinetics. The results present the potential possibilities to completely replace metal-oxide semiconductors with metal nanowires without oxidation and form crystalline metal nanowires with precise epitaxial metal\u2013semiconductor atomic interface. Formation of such single crystalline metal nanowire without oxidation by diffusion to the metal oxide is unique and is crucial in nanodevice performances, which is rather challenging from a manufacturing perspective of 1D nanodevices.", "The design of gelatin-based hydrogels with high mechanical strength, high gelation temperature, and a rapid self-healing property still presents a challenge to researchers. In the present study, single cross-linked gelatin\u2013oxidized tannic acid (SC-GT/OTA) hydrogels were fabricated through covalent cross-linking between gelatin and tannic acid (TA) oxidized by using sodium periodate (NaIO4). Double cross-linked gelatin\u2013OTA\u2013FeCl3\u00b76H2O (DC-GT/OTA/FeIII) hydrogels were also created using metal coordination bonds formed between the catechol groups present in OTA and FeIII in ferric chloride. As a result, the maximum gelling temperature of the SC-GT/OTA hydrogel (37 \u00b0C) was considerably higher than that of the pure gelatin hydrogel (15.4 \u00b0C). Moreover, the maximum values of compressive stress of SC-GT/OTA hydrogels increased significantly by almost seven times the original value as the molar ratio of NaIO4 to TA increased from 3:1 to 5:1. When the molar ratio of NaIO4 to TA was maintained at the constant of 4:1, the storage modulus values of DC-GT/OTA/FeIII hydrogels with the FeIII-to-TA molar ratio of 1.5:1 were three to 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of SC-GT/OTA hydrogels in the whole angular frequency range.

Chem. Int. Ed. 2017, DOI: 10.1002/anie.201700540). DUV NLO materials are increasingly being used in the semiconductor industry and are crucial in producing solid-state lasers with wide frequency ranges. The fluorooxoborate KBe2BO3F2, which is the only practical laser material for generating light below 200 nm, has had researchers scrambling for alternatives to avoid further use of toxic beryllium. It also grows in layers, which can reduce its optical properties. Now, a team led by Shilie Pan, vice director of the Chinese Academy of Science\u2019s Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry, has prepared a class of beryllium-free fluorooxoborate crystals that don\u2019t layer.

However, the instability of the biradical caused by the open-shell nature was one of the drawbacks; therefore, novel radical compounds which can suppress unwanted reactions by tuning the open-shell features are desired to expand the versatility of the radical compounds. Here, we report a novel radical-dissociation-type photochromic compound whose photochromic reaction involves a valence isomerization from the open-shell biradical to closed-shell quinoidal forms by using a phenoxyl-imidazolyl radical complex framework. The valence isomerization from the biradical to quinoid forms effectively tunes the open-shell feature in time and drastically changes the spectral features, which were revealed by time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This novel fast photochromic property not only is important for fundamental spin chemistry but also expands the versatility of the radical compounds for novel advanced photofunctional materials.", "Recent advances in material science and technology yield not only various kinds of nano- and sub-micro-scaled particles but also particles of various charged conditions such as Janus particles. The characterization of these particles can be challenging because conventional electrophoresis theory is usually based on drastic assumptions that are unable to realistically describe the actual situation. In this study, the influence of the nonuniform charged conditions on the surface of a particle at an arbitrary level of surface potential and double layer thickness on its electrophoretic behavior is investigated for the first time in the literature taking account of the effect of double-layer polarization. Several important results are observed. For instance, for the same averaged surface potential, the mobility of a nonuniformly charged particle is generally smaller than that of a uniformly charged particle, and the difference between the two depends upon the thickness of double layer. This implies that using the conventional electrophoresis theory may result in appreciable deviation, which can be on the order of ca. 20%. In addition, the nonuniform surface charge can yield double vortex in the vicinity of a particle by breaking the symmetric of the flow field, which has potential applications in mixing and/or regulating the medium confined in a submicrometer-sized space, where conventional mixing devices are inapplicable.", "The historical development of the traditional U.S. high school biology\u00e2\u20ac\u201cchemistry\u00e2\u20ac\u201cphysics sequence is detailed from the early 19th century to the present time.

Herein, an innovative strategy has been developed for controllably synthesizing K1.9Na0.1Ta2O6\u00b72H2O (KNTO) nanocrystals shaped as octahedra and nanosheets without using any capping agents. The obtained nanocrystals show high activity in photocatalytic H2 evolution from CH3OH/H2O solution, and their performance closely depends on the exposed facets, in which the {111}-facet-bounded nanooctahedra exhibit more than 3 times higher activity than the nanosheets dominated with {101} facets. The influence of surface atomic structure and electronic band structure on the photocatalytic properties of the KNTO nanocrystals is systematically studied. This is the first report for the facet controllable synthesis of tantalate materials with highly regular shapes. The present approach is anticipated as a general strategy for controllable synthesis of tantalate materials and also provides feasibility for rational design and activity optimization of shape-controlled photocatalysts for H2 production.", "Water confined in molecular size domains is distinct to bulk water. The altered interactions between adjacent water molecules, and between water molecules and molecular wall components of the confinement system, determine aspects of important phenomena in material science, biology, and nanotechnology. The structural determination of confined water, however, has proven to be challenging. Here, we describe the crystal structures of three related squaramides 1\u20133 whose molecular structures are modulated by the gradual incorporation of N-methyl groups to the squaramide moiety. The three squaramides differ in their hydrogen bonding capabilities due to the different degree of N-methylation of each one. Thus, while 1\u00b72H2O forms narrow tapes of water molecules, the monomethylated squaramide 2\u00b72H2O produces two-dimensional water layers, and the dimethylated squaramide 3\u00b72H2O develops polymeric one-dimensional water chains. Our observations show that N-methylation heavily alters the interplay between H-bonding and dipolar stacking, the two supramolecular interactions that govern the structural arrangement of squaramides 1\u20133, hence modulating the arrangement of the water molecules within the crystals.", "The influence of the ligand attachment on the activation process of carbon halogen bond on small sized aluminum nanoclusters are investigated using density functional theory. Attaching suitable ligand to metal clusters is among the widely popular techniques often used by experimentalists in order to stabilize metastable clusters. In depth theoretical investigations have shown that based on the jellium configuration of the cluster, attaching an electron withdrawing ligand can either make a cluster more reactive toward the C\u2013I dissociation or may convert the cluster relatively inert. The alteration of the activation barriers and other associated parameters due to ligand attachment are included in this paper along with additional calculations and explanations. The study also shows that even the reaction parameters of specific magic clusters can be significantly altered via ligand attachment. The activation process of small molecules on metal clusters are of crucial importance for the development of material science and cluster chemistry. The present investigation will therefore be useful for better understanding of the properties of the ligated clusters as well as may also aid the experimentalists toward controlling the reactivity of a specific cluster as required.", "The National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine have just published a book, Science, Evolution, and Creationism, that should be read by all scientists and teachers of science.

Recently, we obtained \u201cemergent properties,\u201d such as electronic conductivity and energy transfer, by infiltrating MOF pores with \u201cguest\u201d molecules that interact with the framework electronic structure. In this Perspective, we define a path to emergent properties based on the Guest@MOF concept, using zinc-carboxylate and copper-paddlewheel MOFs for illustration. Energy transfer and light harvesting are discussed for zinc carboxylate frameworks infiltrated with triplet-scavenging organometallic compounds and thiophene- and fullerene-infiltrated MOF-177. In addition, we discuss the mechanism of charge transport in TCNQ-infiltrated HKUST-1, the first MOF with electrical conductivity approaching conducting organic polymers. These examples show that guest molecules in MOF pores should be considered not merely as impurities or analytes to be sensed but also as an important aspect of rational design.", "High-yield synthesis, spectroscopic and solid-state structural proof of the lactam-embedded smallest ever metal-free stable H\u00fcckel antiaromatic trans-doubly N-confused [16] porphyrins are reported. These new facets of trans-doubly N-confused porphyrins have been anticipated to exhibit the redox-associated variation of H\u00fcckel aromaticity as a mere consequence of the amido-like structures of the N-confused N-methyl pyrrole rings of the macrocycles. Strong aromaticity upon NaBH4 reduction leading to a resonance dipolar structure of the [18]\u03c0-conjugated system as the reduced congener with concomitant H\u00fcckel topology are the important highlights. Excellent agreement between experimental spectroscopic measurements and the theoretically determined properties elucidate aromaticity switching upon chemical reduction. Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of demand for the experimental realization of stable antiaromatic systems because of their versatile applications in material science.

Recent technological advances in biofabrication and bioprinting have been reported which present significant steps toward achieving this aim. While many approaches to address this challenge derive from microfabrication techniques, progress in the material science field and 3D printing technologies fields have introduced exciting new possibilities for the creation of increasingly complex and functional vascularized tissues. Here, we provide a brief overview of the process of vascularization and its importance within the fields of RM and tissue engineering (TE). We give a brief synopsis of various strategies that have been reported to induce cell patterning for a designed vascular network within a TE construct, including material-based strategies, structural molding approaches, and direct cell-patterning techniques. As well as highlighting advances in the field, we discuss possible areas for further development; in particular, we advocate a combination of strategies to successfully overcome current limitations in developing functional artificial tissues.

This study presents a novel location sensing approach based on an endohedral metallofullerene, Ce@C82, using its anisotropic magnetic properties, which lead to temperature-dependent paramagnetic shifts in 1H NMR spectra. Five site-isomers of Ce@C82CH2-3,5-C6H3Me2 were synthesized to demonstrate the spatial sensing ability of Ce@C82. Single-crystal structures, absorption spectra, and density functional theory calculations were used to select the plausible addition positions in the radical coupling reaction, which preferentially happens on the carbon atoms with high electron density of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) and positive charge. Temperature-dependent NMR measurements demonstrated unique paramagnetic shifts of the 1H peaks, which were derived from the anisotropic magnetism of the f-electron in the Ce atom of the isomers. It was found that the magnetic anisotropy axes can be easily predicted by theoretical calculations using the Gaussian 09 package. Further analysis revealed that the temperature-dependent trend in the shifts is clearly predictable from the distance and relative position of the proton from the Ce atom. Hence, the Ce-encapsulated metallofullerene Ce@C82 can provide spatial location information about nearby atoms through the temperature-dependent paramagnetic shifts of its NMR signals. It can act as a molecular probe for location sensing by utilizing the anisotropic magnetism of the encapsulated Ce atom. The potentially low toxicity and stability of the endohedral fullerene would make Ce@C82 suitable for applications in biology and material science.", "A new take on adhesives inspired by sticky gecko feet has led to stretchy silicone patches that conduct electricity and cling fast to skin, even underwater (ACS Nano 2016, DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.6b01355).

Kinetic studies indicated that the presence of glucose oxidase (GOx) endowed the polymerizations with excellent oxygen tolerance. Good control was maintained during the enzyme-assisted photo-PISA process. This method facilitates high-throughput PISA, allowing for the construction of a detailed phase diagram in a rather short time. We also demonstrate the potential bio-related application of this method by the successful encapsulation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) into self-assembled polymer vesicles without compromising protein activities. This robust oxygen-tolerant PISA approach leads to unprecedented access to well-defined polymer nano-objects for nonexperts.", "Imparting aerogels with structural anisotropy endows these porous materials with direction-dependent properties and promising novel applicability in material science. However, facile fabrication of such anisotropic aerogels under mild conditions still remains a major challenge. Here, we report on the fabrication of anisotropic aerogels from liquid crystalline ordered cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) by a directional freeze-casting process. The resulting CNCs aerogels were millimeter-sized with lamellar macrostructural features and optical anisotropy, exhibiting hierarchical structures perpendicular to the direction of freezing. We show that the birefringence of CNCs aerogels arose from the alignment of CNC liquid crystals, rather than from the shape of rod-like nanoparticles. Moreover, the versatility of the directional freezing approach was expanded to a CNC\u2013silica system, resulting in anisotropic silica aerogels with an ordered mesopore-imprinted structure template by the liquid crystalline ordered CNCs. The highly directional alignment, optical anisotropy, hierarchical porosity, and large internal surface area of the CNC-based aerogels exhibit considerable potential for future fire-resistant, direction-dependent mechanical and electrical insulator applications.", "We show that the gradient force generated by the near field of a chiral nanoparticle carries information about its chirality. On the basis of this physical phenomenon we propose a new microscopy technique that enables the prediction of spatial features of chirality of nanoscale samples by exploiting the photoinduced optical force exerted on an achiral tip in the vicinity of the test specimen. The tip\u2013sample interactive system is illuminated by structured light to probe both the transverse and longitudinal (with respect to the beam propagation direction) components of the sample\u2019s magnetoelectric polarizability as the manifestation of its sense of handedness, i.e., chirality. We specifically prove that although circularly polarized waves are adequate to detect the transverse polarizability components of the sample, they are unable to probe the longitudinal component. To overcome this inadequacy and probe the longitudinal chirality, we propose a judiciously engineered combination of radially and azimuthally polarized beams as optical vortices possessing pure longitudinal electric and magnetic field components along their vortex axis, respectively. The proposed technique may benefit branches of science such as stereochemistry, biomedicine, physical and material science, and pharmaceutics.", "Decreased funding for middle and high school education has resulted in reduced classroom time, which, when coupled with an increased focus on standardized testing, has decreased the exposure of many middle school students to hands-on science education. To help address these challenges, we developed an integrated outreach program, spanning grades 6\u201312, designed to engage students by bringing students to the University of Oregon to perform hands-on laboratory experiments. Initially developed to supplement science education lost to state-mandated furlough days, the programmatic design can be applied readily in other contexts including afterschool, weekend, or summer programs. The outreach activities and scaffolding rely heavily on near-peer mentoring, which provides a visible pathway for younger students to envision themselves as future scientists while also providing mentoring and leadership opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The use of near-peer mentoring is also critically important for the program\u2019s sustainability because it enables a more efficient allocation of graduate student and faculty time.

Naturally occurring photoresponsive systems provide the motivation for developing corresponding artificial systems using molecular self-assembly to address issues such as quantum efficiency, selectivity, and amplification. A practical strategy for developing photoresponsive materials is to utilize molecules that can undergo considerable change in shape on photoisomerization. Although the photoisomerization of polyenes between their linear all-trans isomer and bent cis isomers has been extensively investigated in solution and in organized media because of its relevance to naturally occurring photoresponsive systems, its use in developing artificial photoresponsive systems has not been well explored. This feature article provides an overview of photoresponsive soft materials such as liquid crystals and gels with special emphasis on our recent studies related to the use of the butadiene chromophore for the design of such materials. The role of molecular self-assembly in controlling the photochemical and photophysical properties of these molecules is also discussed.", "\"Mystery of Mysteries: Is Evolution a Social Construction?\" by Michael Ruse, Harvard University Press, 1999, 296 pages, $27.50 (ISBN 0-674-46706-X)\nThe title of Michael Ruse's book\u2014\"Mystery of Mysteries: Is Evolution a Social Construction?\"\u2014suggests a rather ambitious undertaking, and on that score readers are certainly not disappointed. Ruse, a professor of philosophy and zoology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, looks at the ongoing debates known as the \"science wars\" and identifies as their central issue a fundamental controversy about the nature of science. Is science best described as objective knowledge about the real world, or is it a subjective reflection of the culture it exists in? Ruse attempts to resolve this controversy by exploring the history of evolutionary biology.\nHis strategy is to distinguish between and assess the relative influence of two classes of values that drive the scientist. Epistemic values include the norms and criteria that philosophers offer as characteristic of science, such ...", "The mid-infrared spectral band (2\u201320 \u03bcm) is of significant technological importance for thermal imaging, spectroscopic sensing, and free-space communications. Lack of optical materials compatible with common semiconductor substrates, however, presents a standing hurdle for integrated photonic device development in the mid-infrared domain. Tellurene, atomically thin crystals of elemental tellurium, is an emerging 2-D material amenable to scalable solution-based synthesis. It uniquely combines small and tunable bandgap energies, high carrier mobility, exceptionally large electro-optic activity, and superior chemical stability, making it a promising and versatile material platform for mid-infrared photonics. With these material properties in mind, we propose and design a waveguide-integrated tellurene photodetector and Pockels effect modulator. The photodetector boasts a record room temperature noise equivalent power of 0.03 fW/Hz1/2 at 3 \u03bcm wavelength, while the optimized modulator device claims a half-wave voltage-length product (V\u03c0\u00b7L) of 2.7 V\u00b7cm and a switching energy of 12.0 pJ/bit, both representing substantial improvements to current state-of-the-art devices.", "Using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as building blocks, we fabricated a viscoelastic material. In contrast to existing conventional materials where the stiffness (storage modulus) increases when the viscosity (damping ratio) decreases, both of these two aspects could be simultaneously improved for the viscoelastic CNT material.

This unique phenomenon was explained by a zipping and unzipping of carbon nanotubes at contacts as the origin of viscoelasticity.", "The past decade has brought about a wave of globalization, which has affected everything from business to education. In the education sector, many programs have adapted to globalization by incorporating study-abroad components into their curricula. However, academic science in the United States has notoriously resisted the push to adopt a more internationalized approach to educating its students, and continues to do so to this day. Particularly at the graduate level, American students are reluctant to study abroad, which may have a drastic impact on the future of science in America. As a participant in the National Science Foundation\u2019s East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute fellowship program, I was able to experience many of the advantages a science graduate student stands to gain as they take their thesis to another country. Recognizing that a research abroad experience also comes with its risks and difficulties, much of the material presented here aims to facilitate and clarify the process of identifying and completing study abroad programs for science graduate students. These students, in turn, will be in a better position to help the field of science overcome many of the barriers currently hindering scientific progress.", "My journey towards the design and development of catalysts started with an aim to develop innovative, green, and economical processes for chemical industry and to fulfill my life\u2019s ambition of serving the society through meaningful research contributions.

They borrow in the sense that the laws that serve as the basis of chemistry, physics, and engineering are equally applicable to macromolecules. They contribute in a similar manner, that is, basic principles formulated within the framework of polymer science and technology are applicable to chemistry and other disciplines. Thus, the technological principles applicable to the processing of metals are applicable to the processing of polymers and vice versa.\nBriefly, polymer science is the science that deals with large molecules wherein the chemical bonds are largely covalent. Polymer technology is the practical application of polymer science. The word \"polymer\" is derived from the Greek \"poly\" (many) and \"meros\" (parts). The word \"macromolecule\" (\"macro\" meaning large) is often used synonymously for polymer, and vice versa. Some scientists tend to differentiate between the two terms", "Lithium ions move through a common battery material in unusual ways that defy accepted wisdom, according to a new study (Nat.

Compared with lithium-cobalt materials used as cathodes in batteries for electric vehicles and portable electronics, lithium iron phosphate is cheaper and safer and lasts twice as long, for around 1,000 charge cycles. This lifetime could be even longer, potentially tens of thousands of charging cycles, says William Chueh, a materials scientist and engineer at Stanford University. But during battery discharge, when lithium ions move from the electrolyte into a lithium iron phosphate cathode, the ions tend to collect in hot spots in the material, creating lithium-rich and lithium-poor regions.

Synthetic modifications are commonly used to alter those conformations and create engineered biomaterials. In stark contrast, the chemical complexity and dynamic nature of polysaccharides have hampered a detailed structural characterization and structure\u2013function correlations are still incomplete. Many synthetic strategies have been developed to access complex unnatural oligosaccharides, capable of mimicking or even improving the properties of the natural counterpart. However, the structural features behind these results are often neglected. This perspective highlights the approaches adopted to develop unnatural glycans, with a particular focus on how the insertion of specific modifications results in more flexible or more constrained structures. Synthetic analogues of natural oligosaccharides could shine light on fundamental structural features. The combination of modern synthetic, computational, and analytical methods will result in novel carbohydrate based foldamers, with defined shape and aggregation behavior. Multiple applications in biology, material science, and nanotechnology can be envisioned.", "A polypeptide with a GlyHisGly repeating sequence containing zwitterionic structures that effectively interact with cellulose was synthesized by chemoenzymatic polymerization followed by postfunctionalization of the side chains of the His residues to afford imidazolium butyrate. The resulting zwitterionic polypeptide effectively dissociated bundles of tunicate cellulose microcrystals, even when the conditions were mild and the concentration of the polypeptide was low. Polypeptide treatment also affected the morphology of the cell walls in cultured plant cells, and the cellulose microfibril networks and amorphous polysaccharide layer were dissociated according to atomic force microscopy (AFM). The zwitterionic polypeptide treatment did not change the crystal structure of the cellulose microcrystals. Analysis of the mechanical properties of the cellulose microcrystals by force curve measurements using AFM revealed that the elastic modulus of the cellulose microcrystals increased after treatment with the zwitterionic polypeptide, indicating that the amorphous part of the cellulose microcrystals was removed by interactions with the polypeptide. At a concentration of the polypeptide that enabled the dissociation of the cellulose network, the zwitterionic polypeptide showed negligible cytotoxicity to the plant cells. The mild and noncytotoxic technique for loosening cellulose microfibrils/microcrystals that was developed in this study has tremendous significance for the modification of cellulose in terms of polymer chemistry, material science and plant biotechnology.", "Materials chemistry has become a field of high priority internationally, in terms of both fundamental and applied science. Although a growing field in industrial and scientific research, materials chemistry continues to be a minor segment of the academic curriculum. We propose using sol-gel chemistry to introduce undergraduate chemistry majors to the field of materials chemistry. In this experiment, students vary the synthetic processes necessary for xerogel production. They investigate how different parameters (e.g., temperature and pH) affect the internal porous network during xerogel synthesis. Techniques such as inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis are used to investigate the porous nature of xerogels. Conclusions are drawn on the basis of measurements that reflect the pore diameters. By varying the synthetic processes and comparing their experimental results, students are introduced to the concept of cooperative learning to enhance teamwork in the laboratory. Students are introduced to data handling, to writing formal reports in the style common in chemistry journals, and to use of scientific literature. However, the primary objective is to introduce them to the synthesis and characterization of a material.", "This paper reveals and describes the features of NicoreAushell nanoparticles\u2019 magnetic properties.

Compared with nanostructured fcc-Ni powders, there is a decrease in the coercive force, the presence of \u201chard\u201d magnetization, rising magnetization along with increasing degree of the nanoparticles\u2019 oxidation, and a decrease in magnetic characteristics to very low values at 300 K. These features are related to the structure of Ni cores (size and ico-structure of their units), shielding by Au shells, Au\u2013Ni solid solution, and Ni(OH)2, and their near-surface \u201cfrozen\u201d spin subsystem. The latter depends on the sizes of nanocores and the Au\u2013Ni interface. All of these features were discussed on the basis of material science research the authors provided for the NicoreAushell nanoparticles. This long-term study was completed by the present investigation as the most detailed for magnetic-diamagnetic core\u2013shell systems nanosized nowadays.", "To identify the low energy pathway for solid-to-solid phase transition has been a great challenge in physics and material science. This work develops a new theoretical method, namely, variable-cell double-ended surface walking (VC-DESW) to locate the transition state (TS) and deduce the pathway in solid phase transition. Inherited from the DESW method ( J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013, 9, 5745) for molecular systems, the VC-DESW method implements an efficient mechanism to couple the lattice and atom degrees of freedom. The method features with fast pseudopathway building and accurate TS location for solid phase transition systems without requiring expensive Hessian computation and iterative pathway optimization. A generalized coordinate, consisting of the lattice vectors and the scaled atomic coordinates, is designed for describing the crystal potential energy surface (PES), which is able to capture the anisotropic behavior in phase transition. By comparing with the existing method for solid phase transition in different systems, we show that the VC-DESW method can be much more efficient for finding the TS in crystal phase transition. With the combination of the recently developed unbiased stochastic surface walking pathway sampling method, the VC-DESW is further utilized to resolve the lowest energy pathway of SiO2 \u03b1-quartz to quartz-II phase transition from many likely reaction pathways. These new methods provide a powerful platform for understanding and predicting the solid phase transition mechanism and kinetics.", "Despite the rush to place educational material online, little quantitative data exists on the value of Web-based course content. In 1998, I created a content-rich Web site (The Natural Science Pages) to enhance science pedagogy in a required, interdisciplinary, non-major science course at John Jay College. Prior to the launch of this site, the large class size (>150) and diverse student body had presented challenges in science instruction. Since launch, the site has proved overwhelmingly successful at enhancing science comprehension. Student performance on standard exams was significantly higher in two semesters after launch than in the semester before launch. The percentage of students receiving a grade of C or better in the course increased from 68% before launch to approximately 78% after launch, and course failures decreased from 8.5% before launch to <5% in two semesters after launch. Over 90% of students responding to a classroom survey felt that the Web site helped them understand the subject matter taught in the course, and approximately 70% of students responded that the Web site helped improve their grade in the course. The site also helped improve student-instructor communication in the course by increasing the number of students who posed questions to the instructor outside of class-time by 5%.

The mechanisms of fibril structuring and formation are not only of medical and biological importance but are also relevant for material science and nanotechnologies due to the unique structural and physical properties of amyloids. We previously found that hen egg white lysozyme, homologous to the disease-related human lysozyme, can form left-handed giant ribbons, closing into nanotubes. By using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry analysis, we here identify a key component of such structures: the ILQINS hexapeptide. By combining atomic force microscopy and circular dichorism, we find that this fragment, synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis, also forms fibrillar structures in water at pH 2. However, all fibrillar structures formed possess an unexpected right-handed twist, a rare chirality within the corpus of amyloid experimental observations. We confirm by small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations that these fibrils are composed of conventional left-handed \u03b2-sheets, but that packing stresses between adjacent sheets create this twist of unusual handedness. We also show that the right-handed fibrils represent a metastable state toward \u03b2-sheet-based microcrystals formation.", "This paper discusses the development and implementation of Today's Science for Tomorrow's Scientist (TSTS), a Web site with tutorials presenting current science research to students in middle school and high school classrooms.

This study presents a novel location sensing approach based on an endohedral metallofullerene, Ce@C82, using its anisotropic magnetic properties, which lead to temperature-dependent paramagnetic shifts in 1H NMR spectra. Five site-isomers of Ce@C82CH2-3,5-C6H3Me2 were synthesized to demonstrate the spatial sensing ability of Ce@C82. Single-crystal structures, absorption spectra, and density functional theory calculations were used to select the plausible addition positions in the radical coupling reaction, which preferentially happens on the carbon atoms with high electron density of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) and positive charge. Temperature-dependent NMR measurements demonstrated unique paramagnetic shifts of the 1H peaks, which were derived from the anisotropic magnetism of the f-electron in the Ce atom of the isomers. It was found that the magnetic anisotropy axes can be easily predicted by theoretical calculations using the Gaussian 09 package. Further analysis revealed that the temperature-dependent trend in the shifts is clearly predictable from the distance and relative position of the proton from the Ce atom. Hence, the Ce-encapsulated metallofullerene Ce@C82 can provide spatial location information about nearby atoms through the temperature-dependent paramagnetic shifts of its NMR signals. It can act as a molecular probe for location sensing by utilizing the anisotropic magnetism of the encapsulated Ce atom. The potentially low toxicity and stability of the endohedral fullerene would make Ce@C82 suitable for applications in biology and material science.", "This study provides a systematic approach for assessment of contaminants in materials for recycling.

The polymer initiator covered substrates are used for preparation of poly(styrene) and poly(acrylate) brushes with defined and tunable brush thicknesses. Brush thickness dependent site-specific protein adsorption of streptavidin and concanavalin A on structured polystyrene brushes is reported. Poly(styrene) brushes with a thickness of 40 nm or larger showed protein repellence whereas brushes below 15 nm thickness reveal protein adhesive properties.

The alteration of the activation barriers and other associated parameters due to ligand attachment are included in this paper along with additional calculations and explanations. The study also shows that even the reaction parameters of specific magic clusters can be significantly altered via ligand attachment. The activation process of small molecules on metal clusters are of crucial importance for the development of material science and cluster chemistry.

The EEM-g-polyvinylpyrrolidone (or EEM-g-sodium polystyrenesulfonate) negative electrodes are combined with Ni(OH)2 positive electrodes for the fabrication of asymmetric supercapacitors. Notably, the device presents a maximum energy density of 27.8 W h/kg (or 27.5 W h/kg) when the power density is 351 W/kg (or 314 W/kg), and the capacitance retention is 70.0% (or 65.0%) of the initial capacitance value after 10\u2009000 cycles.", "More evidence against fossilized life on martian meteorite\nA key assumption made by those who maintain that martian meteorite ALH84001 contains fossils of ancient microbes is that carbonate globules inside the meteorite, where the putative fossils exist, precipitated out from low-temperature fluids that seeped into the host rock\u2014a scenario friendly to life.

The material might prove useful in laser-based spectroscopy.\nUrea crystals, which only recently have been grown to sizes and with qualities suited for optical uses, are more efficient than other crystalline materials being tested in similar laser devices, according to Jean-Marc Halbout. He, William Donaldson, and Samuel Blit are part of a group of electrical engineers, led by Chung L.

The infrared and Raman modalities with different selection rules provide complementary information. Specifically, infrared microscopy provides strong signals in the fingerprint region, but suffers from low spatial resolution. Raman microscopy provides submicrometer resolution, but requires a long acquisition time. We developed a system that combines the strengths of both techniques by integrating confocal Raman microspectroscopy to the recently developed mid-infrared photothermal microscopy. This hybrid system is capable of fast infrared photothermal imaging of living cells with submicrometer resolution to identify points of interest, followed by a full-spectrum Raman analysis of the identified objects. In addition, a fingerprint photothermal spectrum can be acquired by scanning the wavelengths of the infrared laser. Comprehensive vibrational fingerprint mapping of live cells, demonstrated in adipocytes and single bacteria, promises broad applications of this technology in biology and material science.", "Recent theoretical findings suggest that the local flexibility of a polymer, linked to the chemical details of the molecule, can affect both the position and the size of knots along the polymer itself. Being of relevance in biology and material science, we further investigate this issue by performing molecular dynamics simulations on a model of diblock flexible\u2013stiff polymer ring hosting a trefoil knot. We show that when both blocks are sufficiently long to accommodate the knot, by raising the temperature T, one may shift the knot position from the flexible part to the stiffer one. Even a very short flexible region has a high probability of lying within the knotted portion at lower temperatures. In addition, we observe that there is a tendency for either extremities of the knot to pin at the interface of the two blocks. This correlation between knot position and bending inhomogeneity supports the view that enzymes, binding the DNA in proximity of single-stranded gaps and nicks, have a better chance to alter the global topology of the chain. Finally, we observe that knots, initially squeezed within flexible portions shorter than the typical knot size, may give rise to long-lived metastable states.", "LOOK DEEP into the world of materials and you'll find tiny wonders\u2014crystalline blossoms, nanoscale lollipops, and rainbow colors bathing a lone droplet of water.

How to synthesize a novel, safe, biodegradable, and biocompatible material to replace synthetic materials is of interest in fields of food, biomedicine, and material science. In this study, we successfully fabricated two series of novel and multifunctional-modified starch nanoparticles (MPN@DBS-NPs and MPN@SNCs) by introducing MPN coatings to debranched starch nanoparticles (DBS-NPs) or starch nanocrystals (SNCs) based on the reaction coordinates of the tannic acid (TA) and iron ions. The resulting MPN@DBS-NP and MPN@SNC, each with a spherical shape, measured approximately 75\u201395 and 110\u2013125 nm in diameter, respectively. Moreover, these nanoparticles provided a negligible release of TA at both a neutral pH (7.4) and an alkaline pH (9.0), as well as a highly efficient release at physiologically relevant acidic pH levels (1.2, 3.0, and 5.0). By utilizing the unique nature of TA, the functionalized surface modification strategy provided the DBS-NP and SNC with excellent antioxidant bioactivity. Notably, significant effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were observed. Cell assays confirmed that MPN@DBS-NP exhibited nontoxicity and high biocompatibility.

Prior to the launch of this site, the large class size (>150) and diverse student body had presented challenges in science instruction. Since launch, the site has proved overwhelmingly successful at enhancing science comprehension. Student performance on standard exams was significantly higher in two semesters after launch than in the semester before launch. The percentage of students receiving a grade of C or better in the course increased from 68% before launch to approximately 78% after launch, and course failures decreased from 8.5% before launch to <5% in two semesters after launch. Over 90% of students responding to a classroom survey felt that the Web site helped them understand the subject matter taught in the course, and approximately 70% of students responded that the Web site helped improve their grade in the course. The site also helped improve student-instructor communication in the course by increasing the number of students who posed questions to the instructor outside of class-time by 5%.

Using a sandwich-type proof-of-concept immunoassay, we found that the charge transfer complex of the iron oxide NPs-mediated one-electron oxidation product of TMB (oxidized TMB) exhibited not only color changes, but also a strong near-infrared (NIR) laser-driven photothermal effect. Hence, oxidized TMB was explored as a new sensitive photothermal probe to convert the immunoassay signal into heat through the near-infrared laser-driven photothermal effect, enabling simple photothermal immunoassay using a thermometer.

Of the few states that do include polymer education, this is only found at the high school level, primarily in biology or chemistry. Over the past year, we have developed a graduate-student-run outreach initiative aimed at providing young students with an understanding and appreciation of this class of materials through the interactive teaching of polymer science with audience-appropriate language.

Most importantly, each of our lessons has multiple hands-on activities to reiterate and reinforce the concepts taught through active learning. In teaching our graduate student volunteer instructors to research and understand the vocabulary of their audience, we also hope to encourage these future educators toward active and perceptive science teaching, which has been demonstrated to afford greater short- and long-term lesson retention among students. This in effect provides two motivations for our program: (1) making polymers relatable to young students, thereby providing them a foundation prior to their introduction into the curriculum, and (2) teaching the next generation of educators in polymer science how to communicate effectively with their classes.

Their unique crystal structure and ability to physically see growth make for a unique undergraduate laboratory experience. This experiment uses dendrite growth to explore the physical and chemical driving forces behind dendrite growth through a set of viscous, supersaturated solutions of varying ammonium chloride and gelatin concentrations. The degree of NH4Cl supersaturation determines growth rate, which can be mediated by the gelatin limiting diffusional mass transfer. This exercise was designed for a material science course, though it could easily be adapted to an inorganic or general chemistry course. Through this experiment, students are introduced to optical microscopy for quantitative analysis, a common, inexpensive analytical research tool rarely seen in the undergraduate laboratory. When chemical driving forces are dominant (low gelatin, high salt concentrations), a more ordered dendrite structure forms, with primary branches at 90\u00b0 angles. Conversely, as diffusion becomes more dominant, a more disordered, denser dendrite structure is observed and the growth rate is slower.

By examining how cell membranes interact with topographical features such as nanoscale protrusions or invaginations, we discovered that the cell membrane readily deforms inward and wraps around protruding structures, but hardly deforms outward to contour invaginating structures. This asymmetric membrane response (inward vs outward deformation) causes the cleft width between the cell membrane and the nanostructure surface to vary by more than an order of magnitude.

Resource productivity is ubiquitous, from the IPAT identity to the analysis of dematerialization trends and policy goals. High resource productivity is interpreted as the sign of a resource-efficient, and hence more sustainable, economy. Its inverse, resource intensity (resource per GDP) has the reverse behavior, with higher values indicating environmentally inefficient economies. In this study, we investigate the global systematic relationship between material, energy and carbon productivities, and economic activity. We demonstrate that different types of materials and energy exhibit fundamentally different behaviors, depending on their international income elasticities of consumption. Biomass is completely inelastic, whereas fossil fuels tend to scale proportionally with income. Total materials or energy, as aggregates, have intermediate behavior, depending on the share of fossil fuels and other elastic resources. We show that a small inelastic share is sufficient for the total resource productivity to be significantly correlated with income. Our analysis calls into question the interpretation of resource productivity as a sustainability indicator.

In this study, we successfully fabricated two series of novel and multifunctional-modified starch nanoparticles (MPN@DBS-NPs and MPN@SNCs) by introducing MPN coatings to debranched starch nanoparticles (DBS-NPs) or starch nanocrystals (SNCs) based on the reaction coordinates of the tannic acid (TA) and iron ions. The resulting MPN@DBS-NP and MPN@SNC, each with a spherical shape, measured approximately 75\u201395 and 110\u2013125 nm in diameter, respectively. Moreover, these nanoparticles provided a negligible release of TA at both a neutral pH (7.4) and an alkaline pH (9.0), as well as a highly efficient release at physiologically relevant acidic pH levels (1.2, 3.0, and 5.0). By utilizing the unique nature of TA, the functionalized surface modification strategy provided the DBS-NP and SNC with excellent antioxidant bioactivity. Notably, significant effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were observed. Cell assays confirmed that MPN@DBS-NP exhibited nontoxicity and high biocompatibility. Together, the cytocompatibility, antioxidant, and antibacterial characteristics of the novel pH-sensitive-modified starch make them promising candidates for food and biomedical applications.", "Vibrational spectroscopic imaging techniques, based on infrared absorption or Raman scattering, allow for noninvasive chemically specific visualization of biological systems. The infrared and Raman modalities with different selection rules provide complementary information. Specifically, infrared microscopy provides strong signals in the fingerprint region, but suffers from low spatial resolution. Raman microscopy provides submicrometer resolution, but requires a long acquisition time. We developed a system that combines the strengths of both techniques by integrating confocal Raman microspectroscopy to the recently developed mid-infrared photothermal microscopy. This hybrid system is capable of fast infrared photothermal imaging of living cells with submicrometer resolution to identify points of interest, followed by a full-spectrum Raman analysis of the identified objects. In addition, a fingerprint photothermal spectrum can be acquired by scanning the wavelengths of the infrared laser. Comprehensive vibrational fingerprint mapping of live cells, demonstrated in adipocytes and single bacteria, promises broad applications of this technology in biology and material science.", "Chemistry research is an eloquent, yet extremely complex discipline consisting of a diverse range of topics. The complexity of every sub-discipline requires extensive focus, which can limit cross-talk between fields, thus leading to their isolation. In particular, natural product and material chemistries have experienced this trend, and it has led to an ever growing separation between them. Yet by looking at the fundamental aspect of the relationship between molecular design and the resulting properties, it is possible to remind chemists of their ability to bridge these research areas. It is intradisciplinary collaborations that can provide a path toward collectively addressing the many challenges of chemistry.", "This installment of reviews of chemistry-related articles published in The Science Teacher (TST) highlights material published from December 2009 through Summer 2010.

The vanadium phosphate structure was synthesized and characterized by Victoria Soghomonian and Robert C. Haushalter at NEC Research Institute, Princeton, N.J., Qin Chen and Jon Zubieta at Syracuse University, and Charles J. O'Connor at the University of New Orleans [ Science , 259 , 1596 (1993)]. The material contains vanadium oxo pentamer units bonded together by P 5+ cations to form chiral double helices. The helices are entwined so as to form tunnels and cavities that are filled with (CH 3 ) 2 NH 2+ and K+ ions (derived from reagents used in the synthesis). The tunnels and cavities, along with the material's chirality, suggest potential applications as a shapeselective absorption medium or as a catalyst that might discriminate between enantiomers. The material is also strongly paramagnetic at high temperatures. \"Since ...", "1,10-Phenanthroline represents a well-known versatile ligand system finding many applications in chemistry, biology, and material science. The properties and thus the use of these molecules are determined by coordinating metal ions and ligand substituents. Advanced ligand systems that, for instance, feature simultaneously an integrated photochrome and a surface anchoring group require the introduction of several differing substituents and the synthesis of asymmetric derivatives. In spite of a long history of the ligand system\u2014and to our great surprise\u2014a general synthetic approach allowing the introduction of differing substituents at positions (3,8) and (5,6) of 1,10-phenanthroline is not known. Here, we present a general approach for the synthesis of such phenanthrolines. The approach is used to integrate a diarylethene photochrome into a functionalized phenanthroline and thus to synthesize a novel photoswitchable phenanthroline and a corresponding spin-crossover molecular photoswitch. The functionality of both the ligand and its iron(II) complex at room temperature has been demonstrated. The importance of this work for chemical grafting of molecular switches based on phenanthrolines is emphasized.", "The exploration of new physical and chemical properties of materials and their innovative application in different fields are of great importance to advance analytical chemistry, material science, and other important fields. Herein, we, for the first time, discovered the photothermal effect of an iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs)-mediated TMB (3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine)-H2O2 colorimetric system, and applied it toward the development of a new NP-mediated photothermal immunoassay platform for visual quantitative biomolecule detection using a thermometer as the signal reader. Using a sandwich-type proof-of-concept immunoassay, we found that the charge transfer complex of the iron oxide NPs-mediated one-electron oxidation product of TMB (oxidized TMB) exhibited not only color changes, but also a strong near-infrared (NIR) laser-driven photothermal effect. Hence, oxidized TMB was explored as a new sensitive photothermal probe to convert the immunoassay signal into heat through the near-infrared laser-driven photothermal effect, enabling simple photothermal immunoassay using a thermometer. Based on the new iron oxide NPs-mediated TMB-H2O2 photothermal immunoassay platform, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a model biomarker can be detected at a concentration as low as 1.0 ng\u00b7mL\u20131 in normal human serum. The discovered photothermal effect of the colorimetric system and the developed new photothermal immunoassay platform open up a new horizon for affordable detection of disease biomarkers and have great potential for other important material and biomedical applications of interest.", "Two linked courses examining conservation science and art history of 17th-century Dutch painting are described.

Nevertheless, there are downsides in using such phenolic compounds for surface modification such as formation of nonuniform coatings, need for multistep modification, and restricted possibilities for postfunctionalization. In this study, inspired by a strong binding ability of natural polyphenols found in plants, we used three different macrocyclic polyphenols, known as resorcin[4]arenes, to modify the surface of different substrates by simple dip-coating into the dilute solution of these compounds. Eight hydroxyl groups on the large rim of these resorcin[4]arenes provide multiple anchoring points to the surface, whereas the lower rim decorated with different appending groups introduces the desired chemical and physical functionalities to the substrate\u2019s surface. Deposition of a uniform and transparent resorcinarene layer on the surface was confirmed by several surface characterization techniques. Incubation of the modified substrates in different environments indicated that the stability of the resorcinarene layer was dependent on the type of substrate and the pH value. The most stable resorcinarene layer was formed on amine-functionalized substrates. The surface was modified with alkenyl functional groups in one step using a resorcinarene compound possessing four alkenyl appending groups on its small rim. Thiol\u2013ene photoclick chemistry was used to site-selectively postfunctionalize the surface with hydrophilic and hydrophobic micropatterns, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Thus, we demonstrate that resorcin[4]arenes extend the scope of applications of plant polyphenol and mussel-inspired precursors to tailor-made multifunctional nanocoatings, suitable for a variety of potential applications in biotechnology, biology, and material science.", "Azoxyarenes are among important scaffolds in organic molecules.

But the anatomist and the artist, scientist and storyteller, have far more in common than meets the eye. Upon further investigation, it is clear that science and art cannot exist without the other; they are co-constitutive. Scientists must think creatively in order to form theories (the Earth is round, it circles the Sun) that often appear outlandish not only to laymen but even to their own colleagues. The theory of evolution, presented by Charles Darwin in \u201cOn The Origin of Species,\u201d required creativity that was then supported by the evidence-revealed empirical analysis. Essentially, it took Darwin\u2019s right brain to creatively form the question and his left brain to try and refute the question using the scientific method. Similarly, art requires the brain to function in ways that would not be possible without science. For instance, writing music is highly reliant on mathematics, sculpting the human figure requires a basic understanding of our anatomy and physiology, and the technology used in cinema would be not be possible without the leaps made by scientists and engineers during the last century.

The oxygen stoichiometry of 1-2-4, though, is much more stable at high temperatures than that of 1-2-3, a characteristic that is important for practical applications. But 1-2-4's transition temperature of 80 K is uncomfortably close to the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, presenting a major obstacle to practical use of the ceramic. Now, T. Miyatake, S. Gotoh, N. Koshizuka, and S. Tanaka at Tokyo's International Superconductivity Technology Center have chemically altered 1-2-4 so that it superconducts at practical temperatures around 90 K [ Nature , 341, 41 (1989).] The enhancement in transition temperature was achieved by substituting Ca 2+ for 10% of the Y 3+ .

A European team led by senior research scientist Jean-Pierre Locquet at IBM Research Laboratory, Zurich, found that the Tc of a high-quality thin film of the copper oxide superconductor La L9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 grown under compressive epitaxial strain on a substrate is 49 K, roughly double the bulk Tc value of 25 K [ Nature , 394, 453 (1998)]. Compressive epitaxial strain results from interfacial interactions between a film and a substrate with slightly smaller atomic spacing. The film is compressed in the plane of the film but can expand vertically. Only moderate Tc increases have been achieved by applying pressure to other compounds, comments Ivan K. Schuller, a physics professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"An increase by a factor of ...", "People opposed to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as food or in food products are the left-leaning cousins of right-leaning deniers of global climate change.

In this work, we observe direct in situ atomic-scale behavior of Bi droplets segregated on SrBi2Ta2O9 by using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy and demonstrate ordered interface and surface structures for the droplets on the oxide at the atomic scale and unravel a nucleation mechanism involving droplet coalescence at the liquid/solid interface. We identify a critical diameter of the formed nanocrystal in stabilizing the crystalline phase and reveal lattice-induced fast crystallization of the droplet at the initial stage of the coalescence of the nanocrystal with the droplet. Further sequential observations show the stepped coalescence and growth mechanism of the nanocrystals at the atomic scale. These results offer insights into the dynamic process at liquid/solid interfaces, which may have implications for many functionalities of materials and their applications.", "The diverse backgrounds and academic preparation of students attending an open-enrollment, urban university are not compatible with the traditions of college science and mathematics.

Switching voltages above 15 volts are impractical for portable electronic devices, however. The new transistor needs just 5 volts, similar to the voltage required by amorphous silicon transistors used in liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), according to Christos D. Dimitrakopoulos and colleagues at the T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. It tops the voltage performance of previous pentacene-based transistors because it incorporates a gate insulator made of barium zirconate titanate (BZT).

Superficial modification of material with the biopolymer chitosan and low-temperature air plasma led to a slight decrease of sorption capacity. Loose fibers of the same origin as nonwoven material have significantly higher sorption capacities than investigated nonwoven material. White light scanning interferometry analysis of the fibers suggested that roughness of the wool fiber surface has an important role in oil sorption.

Despite the enormous progress in understanding TMDC-based plexcitons using optical-based methods, experimental evidence of plexcitons formation has remained indirect and mapping their nanometer-scale characteristics has remained an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate that plexcitons generated by a hybrid system composed of an individual silver nanoparticle and a few-layer WS2 flake can be spectroscopically mapped with nanometer spatial resolution using electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. Experimental anticrossing measurements using the absorption-dominated extinction signal provide the ultimate evidence for plexciton hybridization in the strong coupling regime. Spatially resolved EELS maps reveal the existence of unexpected nanoscale variations in the deep-subwavelength nature of plexcitons generated by this system.

Recent experimental and computational studies have demonstrated the feasibility of self-assembling knots with up to eight crossings starting from small, identical building blocks. In this work, we investigate computationally a different pathway for knot production. By performing extensive computer simulations of hetero patchy polymers with different patch geometries, we show that it is possible to obtain both torus and twist knots, up to knots with more than 12 crossings. Our results indicate that with patchy polymers it is possible to exploit the bending rigidity of the backbone, the specific geometry of the patches, and the alphabet size to control the spectra of knots of the polymer. In particular, we find that increasing the alphabets to 20 letters tends to suppress knots, a finding that points to a new hypothesis to explain the rarity of knots in proteins. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to fold specific knotted conformations with high precision by designing the heteropolymer sequence. These include both diffuse and highly localized knots as well as two topologies which have not yet been synthesized by self-assembly: the 52 and 10124 knots.", "The multilayered optical coating whose structure consists of optical cavity and multiple layers of ultrathin phase change material (PCM) film is presented.

The phase transition of each PCM layer, separated by ultrathin oxide barrier, can be realized through various crystallization temperatures with respect to the different thickness of ultrathin (<10 nm) PCM film. Accordingly, notable multicolor changing was achieved by thermally or electrically induced selective phase transition of double PCM layers, and its results were compared with transfer-matrix optical modeling.

The properties and thus the use of these molecules are determined by coordinating metal ions and ligand substituents. Advanced ligand systems that, for instance, feature simultaneously an integrated photochrome and a surface anchoring group require the introduction of several differing substituents and the synthesis of asymmetric derivatives. In spite of a long history of the ligand system\u2014and to our great surprise\u2014a general synthetic approach allowing the introduction of differing substituents at positions (3,8) and (5,6) of 1,10-phenanthroline is not known. Here, we present a general approach for the synthesis of such phenanthrolines. The approach is used to integrate a diarylethene photochrome into a functionalized phenanthroline and thus to synthesize a novel photoswitchable phenanthroline and a corresponding spin-crossover molecular photoswitch. The functionality of both the ligand and its iron(II) complex at room temperature has been demonstrated. The importance of this work for chemical grafting of molecular switches based on phenanthrolines is emphasized.", "Plant phenolic compounds and catecholamines have been widely used to obtain substrate-independent precursor nanocoatings and adhesives. Nevertheless, there are downsides in using such phenolic compounds for surface modification such as formation of nonuniform coatings, need for multistep modification, and restricted possibilities for postfunctionalization. In this study, inspired by a strong binding ability of natural polyphenols found in plants, we used three different macrocyclic polyphenols, known as resorcin[4]arenes, to modify the surface of different substrates by simple dip-coating into the dilute solution of these compounds. Eight hydroxyl groups on the large rim of these resorcin[4]arenes provide multiple anchoring points to the surface, whereas the lower rim decorated with different appending groups introduces the desired chemical and physical functionalities to the substrate\u2019s surface. Deposition of a uniform and transparent resorcinarene layer on the surface was confirmed by several surface characterization techniques. Incubation of the modified substrates in different environments indicated that the stability of the resorcinarene layer was dependent on the type of substrate and the pH value. The most stable resorcinarene layer was formed on amine-functionalized substrates. The surface was modified with alkenyl functional groups in one step using a resorcinarene compound possessing four alkenyl appending groups on its small rim. Thiol\u2013ene photoclick chemistry was used to site-selectively postfunctionalize the surface with hydrophilic and hydrophobic micropatterns, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Thus, we demonstrate that resorcin[4]arenes extend the scope of applications of plant polyphenol and mussel-inspired precursors to tailor-made multifunctional nanocoatings, suitable for a variety of potential applications in biotechnology, biology, and material science.", "3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) is the noncanonical amino acid widely found in mussel holdfast proteins, which is proposed to be responsible for their strong wet adhesion. This feature has also inspired the successful development of a range of DOPA-containing synthetic polymers for wet adhesions and surface coating. Despite the increasing applications of DOPA in material science, the underlying mechanism of DOPA\u2013wet surface interactions remains unclear. In this work, we studied DOPA\u2013surface interactions one bond at a time using atomic force microscope (AFM) based single molecule force spectroscopy. With our recently developed \u201cmultiple fishhook\u201d protocol, we were able to perform high-throughput quantification of the binding strength of DOPA to various types of surfaces for the first time. We found that the dissociation forces between DOPA and nine different types of organic and inorganic surfaces are all in the range of 60\u201390 pN at a pulling speed of 1000 nm s\u20131, suggesting the strong and versatile binding capability of DOPA to different types of surfaces. Moreover, by constructing the free energy landscape for the rupture events, we revealed several distinct binding modes between DOPA and different surfaces, which are directly related to the chemistry nature of the surfaces. These results explain the molecular origin of the versatile binding ability of DOPA. Moreover, we could quantitatively predict the relationship between DOPA contents and the binding strength based on the measured rupture kinetics. These serve as the bases for the quantitative prediction of the relationship between DOPA contents and adhesion strength to different wet surfaces, which is important for the design of novel DOPA based materials.", "Discusses the issue of teaching science to nonscience students.", "A letter describing the teaching science in Afghanistan.", "Materials with hyperbolic dispersion are the key to a variety of photonic applications involving nanoimaging, hyper-lensing, and spontaneous emission engineering, due to the availability of high k modes. Here we demonstrate that spin-coated polycrystalline organic semiconducting films with a layered molecular packing structure can exhibit a hyperbolic dispersion over a wide spectral range and support the presence of surface excitonic polaritons. This was evidenced from 670 to 920 nm and is related to the negative real part of the dielectric permittivity of the selected quinoidal organic semiconductor. In addition, the accessible high k modes lead to changes in the spontaneous emission decay rate and photoluminescence quantum yield of emitters placed nearby the organic monolithic (composed of only one molecule and not necessitating an alternating multilayer structure) natural hyperbolic material. This study opens a new route toward single-step solution manufacturing of large-area, low-cost, and flexible organic photonic metadevices with hyperbolic dispersion.", "How can colleges and universities keep an open gateway to the science disciplines for the least experienced first-year science students while also maintaining high standards that challenge the students with the strongest possible high school backgrounds? The Science Advancement through Group Engagement (SAGE) project targets cohorts of less well-prepared, high potential science students as they progress together through the first two years of undergraduate science courses. A study in chemistry revealed that retention of the first cohort of SAGE participants through the gateway chemistry sequence more than doubled that of both historical and contemporary control groups. Moreover, by the fourth course, Organic Chemistry 2, SAGE participants performed as well as students who arrived at university with the strongest possible high school backgrounds.

This material sorbed higher amounts of base oil SN 150 than diesel or crude oil from the surface of a demineralized or artificial seawater bath. Superficial modification of material with the biopolymer chitosan and low-temperature air plasma led to a slight decrease of sorption capacity. Loose fibers of the same origin as nonwoven material have significantly higher sorption capacities than investigated nonwoven material. White light scanning interferometry analysis of the fibers suggested that roughness of the wool fiber surface has an important role in oil sorption. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that this material is reusable. Recycled wool-based nonwoven material showed good sorption properties and adequate reusability, indicating that a material based on natural fibers could be a viable alternative to commercially available synthetic materials that have poor biodegradability.", "Polaritons are compositional light-matter quasiparticles that have enabled remarkable breakthroughs in quantum and nonlinear optics, as well as in material science. Recently, plasmon\u2013exciton polaritons (plexcitons) have been realized in hybrid material systems composed of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials and metal nanoparticles, expanding polaritonic concepts to room temperature and nanoscale systems that also benefit from the exotic properties of TMDC materials. Despite the enormous progress in understanding TMDC-based plexcitons using optical-based methods, experimental evidence of plexcitons formation has remained indirect and mapping their nanometer-scale characteristics has remained an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate that plexcitons generated by a hybrid system composed of an individual silver nanoparticle and a few-layer WS2 flake can be spectroscopically mapped with nanometer spatial resolution using electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. Experimental anticrossing measurements using the absorption-dominated extinction signal provide the ultimate evidence for plexciton hybridization in the strong coupling regime. Spatially resolved EELS maps reveal the existence of unexpected nanoscale variations in the deep-subwavelength nature of plexcitons generated by this system. These findings pioneer new possibilities for in-depth studies of the local atomic structure dependence of polariton-related phenomena in TMDC hybrid material systems with nanometer spatial resolution.", "A series of programs developed at Washington State University to attack some of the manifest problems in science education is described.

Recent experimental and computational studies have demonstrated the feasibility of self-assembling knots with up to eight crossings starting from small, identical building blocks. In this work, we investigate computationally a different pathway for knot production. By performing extensive computer simulations of hetero patchy polymers with different patch geometries, we show that it is possible to obtain both torus and twist knots, up to knots with more than 12 crossings. Our results indicate that with patchy polymers it is possible to exploit the bending rigidity of the backbone, the specific geometry of the patches, and the alphabet size to control the spectra of knots of the polymer. In particular, we find that increasing the alphabets to 20 letters tends to suppress knots, a finding that points to a new hypothesis to explain the rarity of knots in proteins. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to fold specific knotted conformations with high precision by designing the heteropolymer sequence. These include both diffuse and highly localized knots as well as two topologies which have not yet been synthesized by self-assembly: the 52 and 10124 knots.", "A facile approach for material-independent surface modification using norepinephrine was investigated. pH-induced oxidative polymerization of norepinephrine forms adherent films on vastly different types of material surfaces of noble metals, metal oxides, semiconductors, ceramics, shape-memory alloys, and synthetic polymers.

In this research, a simple procedure for the preparation of 2D aluminum hydroxide acetate macromolecules ([Al(OH)(OAc)2]m) has been developed via a nonaqueous sol\u2013gel route at a mild reaction temperature and ambient pressure. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanism for how the self-assembly of these 2D structures occurs, a combination of in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized. It was found that the bridging OH\u20131 and coordination modes of the organic ligands guide the assembly of the planar nanostructures. The theoretical calculation results show that the structures of the [Al(OH)(OAc)2]8 oligomer can be either a linear or a planar structure, and the latter is more thermodynamically favorable than its linear counterpart.

The material, named cephalosporin N by its discoverers, a group of English researchers, is insoluble in most organic solvents and is active against a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.\nThe reasons for believing that the antibiotic is a penicillin are: its behavior with the enzyme penicillanase; its rapid inactivation, at room temperature, below pH 4 or above 9; and its yielding various penicillamine derivatives in decomposition reactions after acid hydrolysis.\nThe material differs from the common penicillins in its hydrophilic character and its bacterial activity.

Because GO is a promising solution-processable precursor for the bulk production of graphene, interest in this old material has resurged. The reactions to produce GO add oxygenated functional groups to the graphene sheets on their basal plane and edges, and this derivatization breaks the \u03c0-conjugated network, resulting in electrically insulating but highly water-dispersible sheets.\nApart from making graphene, GO itself has many intriguing properties. Like graphene, GO is a two-dimensional (2D) sheet with feature sizes at two abruptly different length scales. The apparent thickness of the functionalized carbon sheet is approximately 1 nm, but the lateral dimensions can range from a few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. Therefore, researchers can think of GO as either a single molecule or a particle, depending on which length scale is of greater interest. At the same time, GO can be viewed as an unconventional soft material, such as a 2D polymer, highly anisotropic colloid, membrane, liquid crystal, or amphiphile.\nIn this Account, we highlight the soft material characteristics of GO. GO consists of nanographitic patches surrounded by largely disordered, oxygenated domains. Such structural characteristics effectively make GO a 2D amphiphile with a hydrophilic periphery and largely hydrophobic center. This insight has led to better understanding of the solution properties of GO for making thin films and new applications of GO as a surfactant. Changes in pH and sheet size can tune the amphiphilicity of GO, leading to intriguing interfacial activities. In addition, new all-carbon composites made of only graphitic nanostructures using GO as a dispersing agent have potential applications in photovoltaics and energy storage. On the other hand, GO can function as a 2D random diblock copolymer, one block graphitic and the other heavily hydroxylated. Therefore, GO can guide material assembly through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the selective etching of the more reactive sp3 blocks produces a porous GO network, which greatly enhances interactions with gas molecules in chemical sensors. With their high aspect ratio, GO colloids can readily align to form liquid crystalline phases at high concentration.\nAs single-atomic, water-dispersible, soft carbon sheets that can be easily converted to a conductive form, this 2D material should continue to inspire many curiosity-driven discoveries and applications at the interfaces of chemistry, materials science, and other disciplines.", "This article presents a review of Introducing Science Communication: A Practical Guide edited by Mark L.

Coordination-directed self-assembly has shown great power in the designed construction of well-defined supramolecular systems. However, application of this strategy to the lanthanide edifices is challenging due to the complicated and greatly labile coordination numbers and geometries for lanthanides. Here we demonstrate a sensitive structural switching phenomenon during the stereocontrolled self-assembly of a group of Ln2nL3n (Ln for lanthanides, L for organic ligands, and n = 1, 2, 4) compounds. Systematic variation of the offset distances between the two chelating arms on the bis(tridentate) ligands dictated the final outcomes of the lanthanide assembly, ranging from Ln2L3 helicates and Ln4L6 tetrahedra to Ln8L12 cubes. Remarkably, the borderline case leading to the formation of a mixture of the helicate and the tetrahedron was clearly revealed. Moreover, the concentration-dependent self-assembly of an unprecedented cubic Ln8L12 complex was also confirmed. The luminescent lanthanide cubes can serve as excellent turn-off sensors in explosives detection, featuring high selectivity and sensitivity toward picric acid. All complexes were confirmed by NMR, ESI-TOF-MS, and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Our results provide valuable design principles for the coordination self-assembly of multinuclear functional lanthanide architectures.", "The author presents a brief survey of the reflections of science in literature through the ages.", "Porphyrinic materials show a range of interesting and useful optical and electrical properties. The less well-known subclass of porphyrin diacids has been used in this work to construct an ionic hybrid organic\u2013inorganic material in combination with a halogenidometalate anion. The resulting compound, [H6TPyP][BiCl6]2 (1) (TPyP = tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin), has been obtained via a facile solution-based synthesis in single crystalline form. The material exhibits a broad photoluminescence emission band between 650 and 850 nm at room temperature. Single crystals of [H6TPyP][BiCl6]2 show a photocurrent in the fA and a much higher dark current in the nA range. They also display an unexpected reversible color change upon wetting with different liquids. This phenomenon has been investigated with optical spectroscopy, SEM, XPS, and NEXAFS techniques, showing that a surface-based structural coloration effect is the source of the color change. This stands in contrast to other materials where structural coloration typically has to be introduced through elaborate, multistep processes or the use of natural templates. Additionally, it underscores the potential of self-assembly of porphyrinic hybrid compounds in the fabrication of materials with unusual optical properties.", "An ideal black material absorbs light perfectly at all angles and over all wavelengths.

The material was postfunctionalized by polymer analogous reactions and via Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions (\u201cclick chemistry approach\u201d) to provide a family of photopatternable functional polymers for nanotechnology applications. For this, a series of azides were designed in order to incorporate subunits with specific properties into the materials. Photopatterning was made possible by the introduction of units with a photoremovable amino protecting group (PRG) (nitroveratryloxycarbonyl, NVOC) which may lead to the release of amino functions after selective UV/laser irradiation. Covalent attachment of the functional polymers onto gold was promoted by sulfide-containing anchoring units again introduced as pending groups onto the polymer backbone via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The modified materials were obtained in almost quantitative yields under mild conditions according to IR and NMR studies. Thermal characterization was accomplished by DSC and TGA. Click chemistry is once more proven to be a useful tool for material science, in this particular case for the preparation of functional polymers for photopatterning with modulated properties.", "The need for wear- and scratch-resistant materials drives the quest for new superhard materials.

The bulk modulus of OsB2 was measured using in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction and was determined to be in the range of 365\u2212395 GPa. While this value is slightly less than that of the bulk modulus of diamond, due to the anisotropic crystal structure of OsB2, the axis compressibility in the orthorhombic c-direction is less than the axis compressibility found in diamond. OsB2 also scratches the surface of a sapphire window, indicating that the hardness of OsB2 exceeds 2000 kg/mm2.", "Experiment pins down antiaromaticity of cyclobutadiene\nUsing photoacoustic calorimetry, chemists at the University of Chicago and the University of Colorado, Boulder, have measured the heat released during the formation of the unstable small-ring compound 1,3-cyclobutadiene (CBD).

This gives a new opportunity for combining TOF-SIMS analysis with other instruments within the same analytical chamber. In this work we present the results of conducting elemental characterization of a dedicated model multilayer sample composed of 100 nm thick thin films of Cu, Zr, and ZrCuAg alloy in a fluorine gas atmosphere provided by an in situ gas injection system (GIS). In general, the secondary ion signals were significantly enhanced by up to 3 orders of magnitude, leading to much higher spatial resolution. The quality of elemental images and depth profiles was improved during a single measurement (which usually cannot be obtained at standard vacuum conditions) at a high beam energy of 20 keV. Moreover, fluorine assistance has enabled a mass interference between 107Ag+ and 91Zr16O+ ions to be separated.

Theoretical calculations over die past 25 years have placed this value in the range of 30 to 60 kcal per mole, and earlier experimental work using substituted CBDs put a lower limit of about 15 kcal per mole on the antiaromaticity of CBD. The molecule's notorious instability has made it difficult to obtain experimental data on it direcdy. Ashok A. Deniz, Kevin S. Peters, and Gary J. Snyder overcame Uiis problem by synthesizing a fairly stable precursor molecule that reacts photochemically to produce CBD. ...", "The age of the Anthropocene is upon us, with humans affecting the earth\u2019s climate and environment more than ever before. As a student at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Doha, Qatar and Warsaw, Poland, I experienced firsthand how important it is to educate my peers and the public on the science of climate change. This chapter aims to provide a basic understanding of some of the key concepts of climate science, including how greenhouse gases warm the earth\u2019s surface, how natural processes affect climate, and how the observed changes in temperature today differ from times of change in the past. Evidence that humans are responsible for today\u2019s changes in climate includes a shift in atmospheric carbon isotopes and results from climate models that simulate various climate scenarios. Our modern human ancestors did not experience the climate conditions that the earth is currently careening towards. In order to preserve the habitability of the earth for our species\u2019 survival, immediate actions must be taken to reduce the damaging effects of human activities. Educating students and the public about climate science is a vital step in calling for policies that can make these necessary actions a reality.", "3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) is the noncanonical amino acid widely found in mussel holdfast proteins, which is proposed to be responsible for their strong wet adhesion. This feature has also inspired the successful development of a range of DOPA-containing synthetic polymers for wet adhesions and surface coating. Despite the increasing applications of DOPA in material science, the underlying mechanism of DOPA\u2013wet surface interactions remains unclear. In this work, we studied DOPA\u2013surface interactions one bond at a time using atomic force microscope (AFM) based single molecule force spectroscopy. With our recently developed \u201cmultiple fishhook\u201d protocol, we were able to perform high-throughput quantification of the binding strength of DOPA to various types of surfaces for the first time. We found that the dissociation forces between DOPA and nine different types of organic and inorganic surfaces are all in the range of 60\u201390 pN at a pulling speed of 1000 nm s\u20131, suggesting the strong and versatile binding capability of DOPA to different types of surfaces. Moreover, by constructing the free energy landscape for the rupture events, we revealed several distinct binding modes between DOPA and different surfaces, which are directly related to the chemistry nature of the surfaces. These results explain the molecular origin of the versatile binding ability of DOPA. Moreover, we could quantitatively predict the relationship between DOPA contents and the binding strength based on the measured rupture kinetics. These serve as the bases for the quantitative prediction of the relationship between DOPA contents and adhesion strength to different wet surfaces, which is important for the design of novel DOPA based materials.", "On the trail of ancient milk\nResidues of ancient milk in archaeological pottery have been detected by analysis of the stable carbon isotope compositions of fats preserved in the vessels [ Science , 282 , 1478 (1998)]. Although milk fat has a fatty acid composition that's distinctly different from that of other animal fats, it has been difficult to directly determine milk residues in ancient pottery. The reason\u2014according to studies by Stephanie N. Dudd, a research assistant, and Richard P. Evershed, a reader in chemistry, at the University of Bristol, England\u2014 is that milk fat preserved in ceramic vessels undergoes changes that result in a fatty acid distribution resembling fat from other tissues. But Dudd and Evershed find they can differentiate milk from adipose fat through the isotopic analysis of stearic (C 18 ) acid. The stearic acid in milk has a lower 13 C content than that in adipose fat, reflecting the source of fatty acids. Ruminants make adipose fats ...", 0, "4-Phenoxyphenol is a simple organic molecule that crystallizes as a porous material with channels running throughout the structure. The channels are constructed by a 6-fold hydrogen bonded ring and can host solvent molecules incorporated during crystal growth, with a minimum channel diameter of 5.8\u20135.9 \u00c5; each channel usually contains a single solvent molecule per unit cell. The hydrogen bonded ring shows surprising flexibility, being able both to breathe and to sustain its crystalline integrity even when grown with empty pores. This is particularly surprising given that the remainder of the interactions within the crystal structure are C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions and are weak in nature. It is also possible to grow \u201cdry\u201d porous 4-phenoxyphenol crystals by using a bulky solvent in the recrystallization.", "Graphite oxide sheets, now called graphene oxide (GO), can be made from chemical exfoliation of graphite by reactions that have been known for 150 years. Because GO is a promising solution-processable precursor for the bulk production of graphene, interest in this old material has resurged. The reactions to produce GO add oxygenated functional groups to the graphene sheets on their basal plane and edges, and this derivatization breaks the \u03c0-conjugated network, resulting in electrically insulating but highly water-dispersible sheets.\nApart from making graphene, GO itself has many intriguing properties. Like graphene, GO is a two-dimensional (2D) sheet with feature sizes at two abruptly different length scales. The apparent thickness of the functionalized carbon sheet is approximately 1 nm, but the lateral dimensions can range from a few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. Therefore, researchers can think of GO as either a single molecule or a particle, depending on which length scale is of greater interest. At the same time, GO can be viewed as an unconventional soft material, such as a 2D polymer, highly anisotropic colloid, membrane, liquid crystal, or amphiphile.\nIn this Account, we highlight the soft material characteristics of GO. GO consists of nanographitic patches surrounded by largely disordered, oxygenated domains. Such structural characteristics effectively make GO a 2D amphiphile with a hydrophilic periphery and largely hydrophobic center. This insight has led to better understanding of the solution properties of GO for making thin films and new applications of GO as a surfactant. Changes in pH and sheet size can tune the amphiphilicity of GO, leading to intriguing interfacial activities. In addition, new all-carbon composites made of only graphitic nanostructures using GO as a dispersing agent have potential applications in photovoltaics and energy storage. On the other hand, GO can function as a 2D random diblock copolymer, one block graphitic and the other heavily hydroxylated. Therefore, GO can guide material assembly through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the selective etching of the more reactive sp3 blocks produces a porous GO network, which greatly enhances interactions with gas molecules in chemical sensors. With their high aspect ratio, GO colloids can readily align to form liquid crystalline phases at high concentration.\nAs single-atomic, water-dispersible, soft carbon sheets that can be easily converted to a conductive form, this 2D material should continue to inspire many curiosity-driven discoveries and applications at the interfaces of chemistry, materials science, and other disciplines.", "Lanthanide-containing molecules have many potential applications in material science and biology, that is, luminescent sensing/labling, MRI, magnetic refrigeration, and catalysis among others. Coordination-directed self-assembly has shown great power in the designed construction of well-defined supramolecular systems. However, application of this strategy to the lanthanide edifices is challenging due to the complicated and greatly labile coordination numbers and geometries for lanthanides. Here we demonstrate a sensitive structural switching phenomenon during the stereocontrolled self-assembly of a group of Ln2nL3n (Ln for lanthanides, L for organic ligands, and n = 1, 2, 4) compounds. Systematic variation of the offset distances between the two chelating arms on the bis(tridentate) ligands dictated the final outcomes of the lanthanide assembly, ranging from Ln2L3 helicates and Ln4L6 tetrahedra to Ln8L12 cubes. Remarkably, the borderline case leading to the formation of a mixture of the helicate and the tetrahedron was clearly revealed. Moreover, the concentration-dependent self-assembly of an unprecedented cubic Ln8L12 complex was also confirmed. The luminescent lanthanide cubes can serve as excellent turn-off sensors in explosives detection, featuring high selectivity and sensitivity toward picric acid. All complexes were confirmed by NMR, ESI-TOF-MS, and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Our results provide valuable design principles for the coordination self-assembly of multinuclear functional lanthanide architectures.", "Nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMRP) was used for the synthesis of the random copolymer poly[styrene-r-(4-propargyloxystyrene)] with a narrow molecular weight distribution (PDI \u223c 1.2). The material was postfunctionalized by polymer analogous reactions and via Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions (\u201cclick chemistry approach\u201d) to provide a family of photopatternable functional polymers for nanotechnology applications. For this, a series of azides were designed in order to incorporate subunits with specific properties into the materials. Photopatterning was made possible by the introduction of units with a photoremovable amino protecting group (PRG) (nitroveratryloxycarbonyl, NVOC) which may lead to the release of amino functions after selective UV/laser irradiation. Covalent attachment of the functional polymers onto gold was promoted by sulfide-containing anchoring units again introduced as pending groups onto the polymer backbone via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The modified materials were obtained in almost quantitative yields under mild conditions according to IR and NMR studies. Thermal characterization was accomplished by DSC and TGA. Click chemistry is once more proven to be a useful tool for material science, in this particular case for the preparation of functional polymers for photopatterning with modulated properties.", "Nature of science refers to the processes of scientific activity and the social and cultural premises involved in the creation of scientific knowledge. Having an informed view of nature of science is important in the development of scientifically literate citizens. However, students often come to the classroom with misconceptions about nature of science. The activity model of inquiry is a theoretically grounded and empirically derived model of scientific inquiry and could be used as a thinking frame to help students develop more informed views of nature of science. This paper reports work on how to implement this model in the general chemistry classroom, and on how undergraduate students\u2019 views of scientific inquiry shift. Implementation includes having students reflect on how current topics in science and their own lab work compare to the activity model of inquiry. Students are asked to respond to essay prompts and a pre- and postquestionnaire designed to assess na\u00efve and informed views of nature of science. Findings show student responses to essay prompts and questionnaires and how they shifted in their views of nature of science.", "A novel host material of \u201cM\u201d-type carbazole/fluorene-based mDCzPF with a high triplet energy by utilizing meta-substituted phenyl groups as linkers was developed. It was demonstrated that the position of the substituents significantly affected the molecular configuration and dipole moment, which played a critical role in the device performances. Red phosphorescent OLED utilizing the \u201cM\u201d-type mDCzPF as the host represented a 10-fold operational lifetime improvement over the OLED using a \u201cV\u201d-type pDCzPF linked by para-substituted phenyl groups as the host because of the good charge transport ability of the mDCzPF. Additionally, the \u201cM\u201d-type mDCzPF host was also compatible with a blue emitting phosphorescent emitter PtNON. The PtNON-doped OLED using mDCzPF as the host exhibited a peak EQE of 18.3% with a small roll off, yet maintained an EQE of 13.3% at a high brightness of 5000 cd/m2. Thus, the novel \u201cM\u201d-type mDCzPF could be employed as stable host material for efficient OLED emitting across the whole visible spectrum. This study should provide a viable method for designing new host materials for the development of stable and efficient phosphorescent OLEDs.", "Porphyrinic materials show a range of interesting and useful optical and electrical properties. The less well-known subclass of porphyrin diacids has been used in this work to construct an ionic hybrid organic\u2013inorganic material in combination with a halogenidometalate anion. The resulting compound, [H6TPyP][BiCl6]2 (1) (TPyP = tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin), has been obtained via a facile solution-based synthesis in single crystalline form. The material exhibits a broad photoluminescence emission band between 650 and 850 nm at room temperature. Single crystals of [H6TPyP][BiCl6]2 show a photocurrent in the fA and a much higher dark current in the nA range. They also display an unexpected reversible color change upon wetting with different liquids. This phenomenon has been investigated with optical spectroscopy, SEM, XPS, and NEXAFS techniques, showing that a surface-based structural coloration effect is the source of the color change. This stands in contrast to other materials where structural coloration typically has to be introduced through elaborate, multistep processes or the use of natural templates. Additionally, it underscores the potential of self-assembly of porphyrinic hybrid compounds in the fabrication of materials with unusual optical properties.", 0, "Radioactive Beads Permit New Studies\nRadioactive glass beads are being manufactured and used in biological studies by scientists of the Argonne National Laboratory's division of biological and medical research according to an announcement by the laboratory.\nThe achievement, which was accomplished by a research team composed oi Walter Kisieleski, George Svihla, and Austin M.

A. C. Ivy, University of Illinois, admitted his first report had contained an inconsistency in stating dosage for one patient, and that a letter on yields of krebiozen from blood serum of horses had contained a mathematical error. Ivy contended, however, that the errors were not significant and that more serious mistakes had appeared in the American Medical Association's reports. Holding that statements of certain doctors in the AMA status report differed from statements those same doctors had made to him on krebiozen cases, Ivy granted that the errors probably were not intentional. Attacking charges of secrecy in connection with the disputed cancer drug, Ivy indicated he thought he could produce the material, after some experimentation, on the basis of knowledge he now possesses.

Cyclic voltammetry measurement shows a significant reduction of the reaction overpotential in benefit of the graphene conducting framework. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results reveal that the graphene can greatly reduce the cell resistance, especially the charge transfer resistance. Our investigation demonstrates that the graphene conducting framework can efficiently alleviate the polarization of pristine LMNCO material leading to an outstanding enhancement in cell performance and cycling stability. The superior electrochemical properties support the fine hybrid structure design by enwrapping active materials in graphene nanosheets for high-capacity and high-rate cathode materials.", "Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) detectors have been intensively developed in recent decades due to their unprecedented capability of representing a sample elemental composition in a three-dimensional space from nano- to submilliscale with high spatial resolution and mass resolution. A compact high-vacuum-compatible version of these detectors can be integrated into a focused ion beam (FIB) system which, assembled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), is the most popular tool used in nanotechnology and material science. This gives a new opportunity for combining TOF-SIMS analysis with other instruments within the same analytical chamber. In this work we present the results of conducting elemental characterization of a dedicated model multilayer sample composed of 100 nm thick thin films of Cu, Zr, and ZrCuAg alloy in a fluorine gas atmosphere provided by an in situ gas injection system (GIS). In general, the secondary ion signals were significantly enhanced by up to 3 orders of magnitude, leading to much higher spatial resolution. The quality of elemental images and depth profiles was improved during a single measurement (which usually cannot be obtained at standard vacuum conditions) at a high beam energy of 20 keV. Moreover, fluorine assistance has enabled a mass interference between 107Ag+ and 91Zr16O+ ions to be separated. This remarkable finding has never been reported before and is expected to play an important role in the future evolution of TOF-SIMS analytical protocols, as currently the mass interference between ions remains one of the main drawbacks of the technique.", "The need for wear- and scratch-resistant materials drives the quest for new superhard materials. In this work, we apply two design parameters to identify ultra-incompressible, superhard materialshigh valence electron density and high bond covalency. Our first example of such a material is OsB2. The bulk modulus of OsB2 was measured using in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction and was determined to be in the range of 365\u2212395 GPa. While this value is slightly less than that of the bulk modulus of diamond, due to the anisotropic crystal structure of OsB2, the axis compressibility in the orthorhombic c-direction is less than the axis compressibility found in diamond. OsB2 also scratches the surface of a sapphire window, indicating that the hardness of OsB2 exceeds 2000 kg/mm2.", "The ability to perform multiple chemical reactions independently (orthogonally) in a single reaction vessel can allow simplified reaction protocols for intricate chemical syntheses. Light is an especially advantageous external stimuli to enact such orthogonal chemical reactions due to its independence with other stimuli, instantaneous spatiotemporal control, and material penetrability. The potential to combine orthogonal chemistry and polymerization is also very appealing, as these systems may open the door for polymeric materials to find applications in emerging and high-tech fields, including biotechnology, microelectronics, sensors, energy, and others. We highlight the use of light in orthogonal polymerization protocols, particularly for living and controlled polymerization, and explore potential future directions and challenges for this technology.", "Panray Corp.

However, disclosure of the atomic structure and properties of one-dimensional heterojunctions between Gr and h-BN domains remains a largely unexplored and challenging task. Here, we report an approach to obtain a perfectly oriented and atomically thin hybrid h-BN\u2013Gr heterolayer on the Co(0001) surface. A perfect matching of the lattice parameters ensures an epitaxial growth of both Gr and h-BN on the close-packed Co surface. High crystalline quality of the resulting interface allowed us to uncover the structural and electronic properties of the lateral h-BN/Gr heterojunctions by means of complementary microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. In particular, we established the coexistence of two types of zigzag boundaries made of B\u2013C bonds, while the boundaries with N\u2013C bonds were found to be unfavorable. Observation of spin-polarized edge states at the C-zigzag edges of Gr domains allowed us to determine the atomic structure of C-BN heterojunctions with scanning tunneling microscopy.", "Australians Prepare Pentavalent Osmium Compound\n[Os(en-H) 3 -en]I 2 \u00b74H 2 O-said to be the first pentavalent osmium compound recorded\u2014has been prepared by F.

This opens the perspective to a wide range of new applications, which have attracted lots of interest in the field of material science recently. Therefore, an increasing number of different molecules displaying room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have already been reported. Whereas the efficiency, the lifetime, or the oxygen sensitivity is frequently discussed, the origin of RTP mainly remains vague. Often, material design rules tend to the development of increasingly complex structures. Here, the well-known tetra-N-phenylbenzidine (TPD), an archetypical material showing highly efficient fluorescence and RTP, is broken down to its fragments. As the complexity of the system decreases with the molecule\u2019s size, spectroscopic investigation of this molecular family enables a deeper understanding of the appearance of RTP. With spectral and time-resolved measurements, RTP can be detected for all compounds containing a biphenyl core, with lifetimes up to 0.9 s under inert gas conditions. These findings form the basis of a deeper understanding of the appearance of RTP in organic molecules and therefore allow for a more focused investigation of new materials.", "Increasing recycling will be a key strategy for moving toward sustainable materials usage. There are many barriers to increasing recycling, including quality issues in the scrap stream. Repeated recycling can compound this problem through the accumulation of tramp elements over time. This paper explores the importance of capturing recycler decision-making in accurately modeling accumulation and the value of technologies intended to mitigate it. A method was developed combining dynamic material flow analysis with allocation of those materials into production portfolios using blending models. Using this methodology, three scrap allocation methods were explored in the context of a case study of aluminum use: scrap pooling, pseudoclosed loop, and market-based. Results from this case analysis suggest that market-driven decisions and upgrading technologies can partially mitigate the negative impact of accumulation on scrap utilization, thereby increasing scrap use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A market-based allocation method for modeling material flows suggests a higher value for upgrading strategies compared to a pseudoclosed loop or pooling allocation method for the scenarios explored.", "Versene Salt Used in Treating Heavy Metai Poisoning\nThe possibility of using disodium calcium Versenate for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning has been suggested by two Washington, D.

Here we demonstrate a freeze-drying solvent-exchange method that enabled the isolation of a metastable Fe(III) sulfate decameric cluster formulated [Fe10O2(SO4)12(OCH3)2]\u00b714CH3OH (Fe10). Without stabilization by solvent-exchange, the aqueous species undergoes rapid conversion to the iron sulfate mineral schwertmannite. Monitoring the hydrolysis process from cluster intermediates to schertmannite by small-angle X-ray scattering, we observe the progression from Fe10 to 37 \u00c5 soluble nanoparticles prior to the precipitation process. This condensation behavior of Fe10 is further exploited to develop a simple laboratory synthesis of schwetmannite. In addition, we demonstrate the versatility of the freeze-drying solvent-exchange method by isolating Al(III), Zn(II), and Cd(II) substituted Fe(III) sulfate clusters.

Despite FRAP being a very popular method, it is not easy to assess multifractional molecular diffusion due to limited possibilities of approaches for analysis. Here we present a novel simulation-optimization-based approach (S-approach) that significantly broadens possibilities of the analysis. In the S-approach, possible fluorescence recovery scenarios are primarily simulated and afterward compared with a real measurement while optimizing parameters of a model until a sufficient match is achieved. This makes it possible to reveal multifractional molecular diffusion. Fluorescent latex particles of different size and fluorescein isothiocyanate in an aqueous medium were utilized as test systems.

For determination of the kinetic model function (f(\u03b1) or g(\u03b1)), the isoconversional and Master-plot methods were used.

Kinetic analysis shows that the first degradation stage corresponds to the bond cleavages and polydimethylsiloxane thermal volatilization, which is contolled by the rate of diffusion and evaporation of oligomers produced on decomposition. The observed second degradation step is more complex; it includes two parallel independent reactions with different values of the apparent activation energy. By applying the nonlinear regression (NLR) method, it was found that the second degradation stage can be described by two independent parallel first-order reactions (nth-order reaction model).", "Preparation of the conjugated polymer poly(1,4-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) inside the channels of the mesoporous silica MCM-41 is described.

This article explores the polymer and material science that has gone into the development of CDs and DVDs in prerecorded, write-once, and erasable formats, and magneto-optical (MO) discs and the related minidiscs. Prerecorded CDs and DVDs, where the data is stored as a series of pits physically stamped into a plastic disc, have required new optically-clear grades of the base plastic, technically sophisticated UV acrylic adhesives and lacquers, and a detailed understanding of the surface energy and the optical and electrochemical properties of metals in very thin layers. The different recordable formats have all needed new chemistry for the recording layer: cyanine and phthalocyanine dyes for write-once discs, low-melting alloys with a glassy state for erasable discs, and magnetic materials with closely defined Curie temperatures and hysteresis for MO and minidiscs. Even newer optical storage formats, including multilayer fluorescent or holographic discs are under development, and these are already demanding critical inputs by chemists.", "The principal applications of high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy, in the field of food science, are reviewed, after a short general introduction, mainly focusing on the potential of these investigations, which are, today, routine tools for resolving technological problems.

In general, the correlation of the material functionality and underlying chemical and physical properties is the key question in view of directed device development, performance, and quality control. It has been shown that the combined method grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence analysis (GIXRF) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) can significantly contribute to the nondestructive chemical analysis of buried thin films and interface structures regarding chemical speciation. Recently, we have enhanced the method to allow for a depth-resolved analysis of multilayered nanoscaled thin film structures. By means of appropriate model systems, the methodology has been developed and successfully validated. The model systems basically consist of a carbon cap layer, two titanium layers differing in their oxidation states and separated by a thin carbon layer, and a silicon substrate covered with molybdenum and a carbon layer. A differential approach has been developed to derive the chemical species of each of the titanium layers.", "Understanding the processes by which stem cells give rise to de novo tissues is an active focus of stem cell biology and bioengineering disciplines. Instructive morphogenic cues surrounding the stem cell during morphogenesis create what is referred to as the stem cell microenvironment.

Some of them have shown great promise for their application in plant protection and nutrition. Here, GO-AgNPs nanocomposite was fabricated through interfacial electrostatic self-assembly and its antifungal activity against phytopathogen Fusarium graminearum was investigated in vitro and in vivo for the first time. The results demonstrated that the GO-AgNPs nanocomposite showed almost a 3- and 7-fold increase of inhibition efficiency over pure AgNPs and GO suspension, respectively. The spore germination inhibition was stimulated by a relatively low concentration of 4.68 \u03bcg/mL (minimum inhibition concentration (MIC)). The spores and hyphae were damaged, which might be caused by an antibacterial mechanism from the remarkable synergistic effect of GO-AgNPs, inducing physical injury and chemical reactive oxygen species generation. More importantly, the chemical reduction of GO mediated by fungal spores was possibly contributed to the high antimicrobial activity of GO-AgNPs. Furthermore, the GO-AgNPs nanocomposite showed a significant effect in controlling the leaf spot disease infected by F. graminearum in the detached leaf experiment. All the results from this research suggest that the GO-AgNPs nanocomposite developed in this work has the potential as a promising material for the development of novel antimicrobial agents against pathogenic fungi or bacteria.", "We propose a recently discovered material, namely, \u03b2-CuGaO2 [T.

Quantitative theoretical analysis further indicates the asymmetric Ga 3dz2\u2013O 2pz hybridization as the origin of the Pna21 ferroelectricity.

Industrial scale production of ESS requires optimization of the process conditions to minimize cost without compromising resin quality. Therefore, a robust model was developed that predicts the conversion of double bonds to oxirane under different process scenarios. Data for the model were obtained by epoxidizing 30 g batches of sucrose soyate at three reactor temperatures (55, 60, and 65 \u00b0C), three molar ratios of acetic acid to oil unsaturation (0.25:1, 0.375:1, and 0.5:1), three molar ratios of H2O2 to oil unsaturation (1:1, 1.5:1, and 2:1), three catalyst amounts (1.5, 3.75, and 6 g), and three reaction times (3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 h). The model was highly significant with an adjusted R2 of 97.6% and predicted R2 of 96.8%. The root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.54 showed that the model was a good fit in predicting optimal epoxidation conditions at different process levels. ESS samples epoxidized at 60\u201365 \u00b0C for 4.5\u20135 h had conversion greater than 98% even when reagent amounts were reduced by 18\u201320%.

In no way, however, were we prepared for just how rapidly the materials and technologies associated with this remarkable tool are changing. During the four months over which this article was written - from our initial outline in August 1997 until the time it was completed in December 1997 - it seemed that each time we developed a draft, a new technology was announced: IBM, for example, trumpeted a shift from aluminum to copper conductors in integrated circuits and introduced new magnetic read heads based on the giant magnetoresistance phenomenon during this period. Both of these advances will lead to faster, more powerful computers. Thus, writing this article has given us a distinctly unsettling but nonetheless exhilarating sense of how rapidly materials science is moving. We will not be surprised if, by the time you read this article, some of the materials and processes described will already have been outperformed and displaced, as suggested by the logarithmic plots that dot the landscape of this article. But what we hope will be conveyed is the breakneck pace at which this field is moving, and the vast potential and excitement it holds for all of us.", "In-plane heterostructures of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphene (Gr) have recently appeared in the focus of material science research owing to their intriguing and tunable electronic properties. However, disclosure of the atomic structure and properties of one-dimensional heterojunctions between Gr and h-BN domains remains a largely unexplored and challenging task. Here, we report an approach to obtain a perfectly oriented and atomically thin hybrid h-BN\u2013Gr heterolayer on the Co(0001) surface. A perfect matching of the lattice parameters ensures an epitaxial growth of both Gr and h-BN on the close-packed Co surface. High crystalline quality of the resulting interface allowed us to uncover the structural and electronic properties of the lateral h-BN/Gr heterojunctions by means of complementary microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. In particular, we established the coexistence of two types of zigzag boundaries made of B\u2013C bonds, while the boundaries with N\u2013C bonds were found to be unfavorable. Observation of spin-polarized edge states at the C-zigzag edges of Gr domains allowed us to determine the atomic structure of C-BN heterojunctions with scanning tunneling microscopy.", "Chemical analysis at the nanoscale is critical to advance our understanding of materials and systems from medicine and biology to material science and computing. Macroscale-observed phenomena in these systems are in the large part driven by processes that take place at the nanoscale and are highly heterogeneous. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop a new technology that enables correlative imaging of material functionalities with nanoscale spatial and chemical resolutions that will enable us to untangle the structure\u2013function relationship of functional materials. Therefore, here, we report on the analytical figures of merit of the newly developed correlative chemical imaging technique of helium ion microscopy coupled with secondary ion mass spectrometry (HIM-SIMS) that enables multimodal topographical/chemical imaging of organic and inorganic materials at the nanoscale. In HIM-SIMS, a focused ion beam acts as a sputtering and ionization source for chemical analysis along with simultaneous high-resolution surface imaging, providing an unprecedented level of spatial resolution for gathering chemical information on organic and inorganic materials. In this work, we demonstrate HIM-SIMS as a platform for a next-generation tool for an in situ material design and analysis capable of down to 8 nm spatial resolution chemical imaging, layered metal structure imaging in depth profiling, single graphene layer detection, and spectral analysis of metals, metal oxides, and polymers.", "Isolating Fe(III) clusters from water without stabilizing ligands is significantly challenged by the high acidity of Fe3+-bound water, leading to uncontrolled precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides. Here we demonstrate a freeze-drying solvent-exchange method that enabled the isolation of a metastable Fe(III) sulfate decameric cluster formulated [Fe10O2(SO4)12(OCH3)2]\u00b714CH3OH (Fe10). Without stabilization by solvent-exchange, the aqueous species undergoes rapid conversion to the iron sulfate mineral schwertmannite. Monitoring the hydrolysis process from cluster intermediates to schertmannite by small-angle X-ray scattering, we observe the progression from Fe10 to 37 \u00c5 soluble nanoparticles prior to the precipitation process. This condensation behavior of Fe10 is further exploited to develop a simple laboratory synthesis of schwetmannite. In addition, we demonstrate the versatility of the freeze-drying solvent-exchange method by isolating Al(III), Zn(II), and Cd(II) substituted Fe(III) sulfate clusters. The freeze-drying solvent-exchange method provides a unique opportunity to isolate cluster intermediates and models to aid in our understanding of metal-ion hydrolysis processes in environmental, material science, and geological studies.", "Comprehensive analysis of the multifractional molecular diffusion provides a deeper understanding of the diffusion phenomenon in the fields of material science, molecular and cell biology, advanced biomaterials, etc. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is commonly employed to probe the molecular diffusion. Despite FRAP being a very popular method, it is not easy to assess multifractional molecular diffusion due to limited possibilities of approaches for analysis. Here we present a novel simulation-optimization-based approach (S-approach) that significantly broadens possibilities of the analysis. In the S-approach, possible fluorescence recovery scenarios are primarily simulated and afterward compared with a real measurement while optimizing parameters of a model until a sufficient match is achieved. This makes it possible to reveal multifractional molecular diffusion. Fluorescent latex particles of different size and fluorescein isothiocyanate in an aqueous medium were utilized as test systems. Finally, the S-approach has been used to evaluate diffusion of cytochrome c loaded into multilayers made of hyaluronan and polylysine. Software for evaluation of multifractional molecular diffusion by S-approach has been developed aiming to offer maximal versatility and user-friendly way for analysis.", "The generation and manipulation of valley polarization in controllable ways are important for the valley-related physics and devices.

Using density functional theory, we further predict that the electrical control on the valley degree of freedom could be realized in this triferroic system. The mechanism of electrically controlled valley is elucidated as an intermediate coupling between lattice and ferroelectricity.

Here we project an abundant, nonedible bioresource-based carbon dot\u2013silver nanohybrid as a highly competent larvicidal agent against Culex quinquefasciatus. Mosquitoes have been the closest enemy of humankind for a very long time. Tropical areas around the globe suffer severe ailments due to mosquito-vector-borne diseases. Japanese encephalitis, lymphatic filariasis, etc. are such fatal threats spread by Culex species. With the emergence of nanotechnology, the perspectives of conventional antivector materials have changed dramatically. The C-dot precursor used here was the roots of Cyperus rotundus, a very abundant grass species found in South Asian countries. The nanohybrid was synthesized by a simple thermal approach without the application of additional reducing agent. The nanohybrid was distributed within a narrow size window of <10 nm. The material was extremely effective against C. quinquefasciatus larvae at a concentration of only 0.05 ppm. Electron microscopic evidence put forward the fact that the material enters the larval body by rupturing the cuticular membrane, subsequently destroying the intestinal system.

It requires the assessment of the mass reduction potential of automotive materials, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their production and recycling, and their impact on GHG emissions from vehicle use. The model presented in this paper is based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and completely parameterized, i.e., its computational structure is separated from the required input data, which is not traditionally done in LCAs. The parameterization increases scientific rigor and transparency of the assessment methodology, facilitates sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the results, and also makes it possible to compare different studies and explain their disparities. The state of the art of the modeling methodology is reviewed and advanced. Assessment of the GHG emission impacts of material recycling through consequential system expansion shows that our understanding of this issue is still incomplete. This is a critical knowledge gap since a case study shows that for materials such as aluminum, the GHG emission impacts of material production and recycling are both of the same size as the use phase savings from vehicle mass reduction.", "Better catalyst for hydrodesulfurization\nA sonochemical route to a new, highly active form of molybdenum disulfide, an important hydrodesulfurization catalyst, has been developed by chemistry professor Kenneth S.

The anisotropic 1D nanostructures are designed following thermally controlled material diffusion process rather than the most widely expected kinetically driven crystal growth protocol, and the dopants are introduced at the appropriate stage of the growth for their adsorption. Using preformed magic size wurtzite ZnSe nanowires as the source material and fragmenting them at higher reaction temperature, ZnSe nanorods with variable aspect ratios are designed. These rods follow both inter- and intrarods material diffusion and retain the wurtzite phase throughout their transformation. This helps in understanding the insertion, adsorption, and retention of dopant Mn in the wurtzite phase of the 1D nanostructure.", "Royal Society of Chemistry: Cambridge, 2000. xiii + 175 pp. ISBN 0-85404-600-3. \u00a3 18.95.\nLike most people, I am fond of chocolate. My favorites are the dark bittersweet chocolates, but I enjoy eating it in almost any form. However, until I read The Science of Chocolate, I didn't realize how interesting chocolate is as a material. Consider: chocolate is a solid at room temperature, but melts into a smooth viscous liquid at body temperature (\"melts in your mouth, ...\"). What other food has this property? I can't think of any. When you break a chocolate bar, it snaps, so there must be something crystalline in it to give that rigidity. Most of us have put some chocolate away for another day, forgotten about it, then returned months later to find the glossy brown surface marred by a white \"bloom\". The candy is usually still edible, though it doesn't taste quite as good. I've always wondered why this happens and precisely what the white stuff is.\nThe Science of Chocolate is a concise, readable survey of the history, manufacture, biology, physics, and chemistry of chocolate. The author, Stephen T. Beckett, works for Nestl\u00e9 and is well versed in his subject. While the book is probably best suited to those studying food science and technology, there is a lot of interesting chemistry in its pages. Chocolate is an interesting example of many of the principles that are taught somewhere in the chemistry curriculum.\nOne of the important issues in chocolate manufacture is controlling the flow properties of liquid chocolate. Much of the taste and sensual pleasure in eating chocolate comes from its smooth flow in the mouth. Chocolate is a complex, composite material containing cocoa particles, sugar particles, and fat, mainly cocoa butter and milk fat. To get good flow properties, the cocoa particles must be ground finely--otherwise the chocolate is gritty--but also with a distribution of particle sizes. The solid particles, however, must be coated with fat to get them to flow, so there are important problems in surface chemistry to consider. While the cocoa particles are lipophilic, the sugar particles are not, so an emulsifier, usually lecithin, is needed. The mixture is a Bingham fluid requiring a nonzero shear stress to get it moving, but also shear thinning, which means that the viscosity decreases as the shear rate increases. Ketchup is another familiar example of a Bingham fluid.\nThe familiar snap when a chocolate bar is broken occurs because the fats are partly crystalline. Since cocoa butter is a mixture of triglycerides, its phase behavior is complex. There are at least six different crystal phases: the desirable form for confections, called form V, has a melting point about 33 \u00b0C. The molten chocolate must be \"tempered\" to produce seed crystals so that the final product contains mainly this desirable crystalline phase rather than the lower-melting forms. But there is a more stable, and more dense, phase, form VI, which can be produced in the final product in a slow solid-solid transformation. If this occurs, some of the fat will be forced to the surface, causing the white fat bloom that makes the confection unattractive and less pleasant to eat.\nThis is fascinating science, all contained in the humble chocolate bar. Once I started reading The Science of Chocolate, I found myself carried along by the connections to things I have learned and taught over the years. I will be able to use chocolate as an example in several courses that I regularly teach. This is a book that I will recommend to students to show them how the basic science they are learning is used to manufacture and improve one of their favorite foods. I can also imagine using this book as the basis of a non-majors course or a senior seminar; Chapter 10 contains 18 experiments for students to perform, so it could easily be a lab course as well. Of course, our library should have a copy. Best of all, it makes the eating of chocolate a richer experience.", "Much has changed about publishing since Jeremy Berg wrote his first research paper as a Stanford University undergraduate in the 1970s.

And they waited months for mailed responses from referees. \u201cI learned a fair bit about the process of publishing at that point, for good and for bad,\u201d Berg remembers.

Neutrophils are an essential component of the immune response against biomaterials, but studies on the neutrophil\u2013biomaterial interaction have been largely limited to characterizing their role in establishing an inflammatory microenvironment and antimicrobial activity at implant surfaces. Recent advances in neutrophil biology, especially recognition of their cellular heterogeneity, ability to suppress immune responses, the identification of a new process of cell death, and crosstalk with other immune cell types, have brought about a fundamental change in our perception regarding the activities of neutrophils. Herein, in the context of the progress in our comprehension of neutrophil function, potential avenues for effectively employing neutrophil activity to develop the next generation of regenerative biomaterials are discussed.", "Developing high dielectric permittivity material is vital to satisfy the ongoing demands for the miniaturization of electronic and energy storage devices. Recent investigations uncover the role of a thermodynamical tricritical phenomenon on enhancing the dielectric response. However, such a tricritical point always locates in an extremely narrow composition region, which makes it time-consuming for exhaustive experimental searching of the optimal dielectric permittivity in a given material system. In the present paper, we employ an accelerated discovery strategy to seek the largest dielectric permittivity in Ba(Ti1\u2013x%Hfx%)O3 ceramic material by using an iterative method between computational machine learning and the experimental synthesis and property measurement. The optimal composition is found to be x = 11 with the highest permittivity of \u03b5r = 4.5 \u00d7 104 after 4 loops of iteration involving 6 compositions, which shows higher efficiency compared with conventional experimental searching. Further thermal analysis study suggests that such a permittivity-maximum location on the phase diagram is indeed a tricritical point. Moreover, the microstructure investigation by TEM observation indicates that the tricritical point shows a mottled morphology consisting of numerous nanodomains with multiple phases coexisting, and a phenomenological thermodynamic model based on the experimental result implies that the tricriticality is responsible for the enhanced dielectric permittivity.", "Interactive chemistry activities developed for science museums are described and discussed.

The success of this approach is related to the availability and reliability of high-throughput characterization methods for identifying interrelations between materials structures and properties within the composition spread libraries. A meaningful characterization starts with determination of the Seebeck coefficient as a major feature of TE materials. Its measurement, and hence the accuracy and detectability of promising material compositions, may be strongly affected by thermal and electrical measurement conditions. This work illustrates the interrelated effects of the substrate material, the layer thickness, and spatial property distributions of thin film composition spread libraries, which are studied experimentally by local thermopower scans by means of the Potential and Seebeck Microprobe (PSM). The study is complemented by numerical evaluation. Material libraries of the half-Heusler compound system Ti\u2013Ni\u2013Sn were deposited on selected substrates (Si, AlN, Al2O3) by magnetron sputtering. Assuming homogeneous properties of a film, significant decrease of the detected thermopower Sm can be expected on substrates with higher thermal conductivity, yielding an underestimation of materials thermopower between 15% and 50%, according to FEM (finite element methods) simulations. Thermally poor conducting substrates provide a better accuracy with thermopower underestimates lower than 8%, but suffer from a lower spatial resolution. According to FEM simulations, local scanning of sharp thermopower peaks on lowly conductive substrates is linked to an additional deviation of the measured thermopower of up to 70% compared to homogeneous films, which is 66% higher than for corresponding cases on substrates with higher thermal conductivity of this study.", "Large chiral channels permeate a porous solid assembled from enantiomerically pure building blocks by chemists at Pohang University of Science & Technology in Pohang, South Korea.

The effect has been explained by a change in wettability of the minerals that form the pore surfaces, as a result of the decrease in divalent cation concentration. We have previously demonstrated that, even for solvent cleaned core samples, mineral surfaces retain a significant quantity of carbon containing material and this affects wettability and response to changed salinity. Here we quantified the response of sandstone core plug material in its preserved state (i.e., after storage in kerosene) and after the same core plug material was treated with ethanol and ozone to remove adsorbed organic compounds. We used the chemical force microscopy (CFM) mode of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to directly measure the adhesion force for two types of molecules on pore surfaces of individual sand grains that were plucked from an oil reservoir core plug. We functionalized AFM tips with alkane or carboxylate, so they resembled tiny oil droplets and measured adhesion to the sand grain surfaces in artificial seawater (ASW; 35,600 ppm) and in ASW diluted to \u223c1,500 ppm (ASW-low). Both before and after the ethanol/ozone treatment, and for both the alkane and the carboxylate functionalized tips, the adhesion was lower in ASW diluted to \u223c1,500 ppm than in ASW. For both alkane and carboxylate, the difference in adhesion between ASW and ASW-low was higher before the ethanol/ozone treatment. We attribute this change in response to the salinity dependent force caused mainly by the electric double layer (EDL) at the sand grain surfaces. We interpret the higher adhesion difference, before a very thorough ethanol/ozone treatment, to be a result of the loss of the organic material that was originally adsorbed on these surfaces, which adds to the charge density and thereby to the salinity dependent EDL force. Investigating the same area on the same pore surface, before and after removal of the organic material, demonstrates without doubt that it is organic material that causes the low salinity response, not the underlying mineral surface.", "A review of this book contends that this is a \"MUST read for anyone considering a career in science education.\"", "AS A YOUNG CHILD, I, LIKE countless others, was spellbound by space and space travel as brought to me by the National Aeronautics & Space Administration.

The results show that the domestic CO2 emissions associated with the energy and material goods absorbed by services through the supply chain increased consistently during the decade 1990\u22122000, thereby constituting a key element in the rise in CO2 emissions due to household consumption. The energy and materials within the supply chain underlying services that have been identified as the main causes of this increase include electric power consumption, petroleum products, building renovation and repair, distribution of printed materials, plastic products and water, all of which are necessary to support the services in question.

The synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis confirms that the bulk material assembled via the hard sphere packing (HSP) route exhibits a strong 200 reflection and a relatively weaker 111 reflection, which is the first example in all reported mesostructured materials with the same symmetry. At the morphological macroscale, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly show that the hexagonal platelike micrometer-sized particles consist of nanospheres (\u223c20 nm in diameters) in a close packing mode. The intrinsic pore structure of calcined HSP material has been reconstructed using both electron crystallography (EC) and electron tomography (ET) techniques, which can be simply viewed as a face-centered cubic (fcc) packing of monodispersed hollow silica nanospheres. The EC technique provides a three-dimensional visualization of the pore organization and demonstrates the existence and crystallographic positions of the cagelike mesopores, octahedral and tetrahedral cavities. The ET method directly and accurately determines the sizes of the mesopores and octahedral cavity and offers nanometer-scale structural information at any given local area, which cannot be obtained by conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the EC and ET techniques are simultaneously employed and provide complementary information for the mesostructure determination. More importantly, the structural details collected from the synchrotron SAXS, high resolution SEM, EC and ET techniques are consistent and support the HSP mechanism, different from the well-understood liquid crystal templating or cooperative self-assembly pathways. The complex pore structure and the existence of octahedral and tetrahedral cavities are responsible for the unusual indexation of the SAXS, which is further validated by the structural simulation.

Many methods exist for estimating the drift and diffusion profiles from one or more identifiable diffusive trajectories; however, when many identical entities diffuse simultaneously, it may not be possible to identify individual trajectories. Here we present a method capable of simultaneously providing nonparametric estimates for both drift and diffusion profiles from evolving density profiles, requiring only the validity of Langevin/FP dynamics. This algebraic FP manipulation provides a flexible and robust framework for estimating stationary drift and diffusion coefficient profiles, is not based on fluctuation theory or solved diffusion equations, and may facilitate predictions for many experimental systems. We illustrate this approach on experimental data obtained from a model lipid bilayer system exhibiting free diffusion and electric field induced drift. The wide range over which this approach provides accurate estimates for drift and diffusion profiles is demonstrated through simulation.", "Peptide coatings on material surfaces have demonstrated wide application across materials science and biotechnology, facilitating the development of nanobio interfaces through surface modification.

Statistical analysis of adhesion forces and probabilities obtained on substrates with a materials contrast enabled us to simultaneously compare the peptide binding affinity to different materials. On the basis of the experimental results and corresponding theoretical analysis, we discuss the role of various interfacial forces in modulating the strength of peptide attachment to hydrophilic oxide solid supports as well as to gold.

The purpose of the Conferences is to provide a forum for the discussion of scientific and educational issues of importance to the region and the world that transcend geopolitical boundaries and international politics, and for the development of collaborations among the participants. The topics that are discussed include air and water quality, renewable energy sources, bio-medicinal chemistry, nanotechnology and material science, chemistry safety and security, and chemistry education at all levels. The Conferences are dedicated to the use of science diplomacy as a bridge toward peace in that troubled and very important region of the world. They feature plenary lectures by the Nobel Laureates, workshops, oral and poster presentations by participants from the Middle East, and ample time for everyone to make personal and professional connections.

In this work, the binding mechanism of Hg0 on CuCl2-impregnated carbonaceous material surface was investigated using hybrid density functional theory (DFT). The results indicate that the dissociation mechanism is responsible for CuCl2 adsorption over carbonaceous material sorbent surface. The active chlorine species generated from CuCl2 adsorption can significantly enhance mercury adsorption over carbonaceous material sorbent surface. Hg0 adsorption over CuCl2-impregnated carbonaceous material surface is dominated by a chemisorption mechanism. Surface Cl and C atoms are identified as the active sites for Hg0 adsorption on CuCl2-impregnated carbonaceous material surface. CuCl2 plays an important role in mercury adsorption on CuCl2-impregnated carbonaceous materials. CuCl2 includes the following roles: (1) CuCl2 can increase the reactivity of its neighbor adsorption sites on carbonaceous material surface; (2) CuCl2 can provide additional active sites for Hg0 adsorption; (3) CuCl2 can provide Cl atoms for the oxidation of Hg0 into HgCl. Heterogeneous mercury oxidation over CuCl2-impregnated carbonaceous material surface includes four steps: Hg0 adsorption, Cl migration, HgCl2 formation, and HgCl2 desorption. HgCl2 formation is identified as the rate-limiting step of Hg0 oxidation on CuCl2-impregnated carbonaceous material surface.", "The MXene combining high conductivity, hydrophilic surface, and wide chemical variety has been recognized as a rapidly rising star on the horizon of two-dimensional (2D) material science. However, strong tendency to intersheet aggregate via van der Waals force represents a major problem limiting the functionalities, processability, and performance of MXene-based material/devices. We report a capillary-forced assembling strategy for processing MXene to hierarchical 3D architecture with geometry-based high resistance to aggregation. Aggregate-resistant properties of 3D MXene not only double the surface area without loss of the intrinsic properties of MXene but also render the characteristics such as kinetics-favorable framework, high robustness, and excellent processability in both solution and solid state. Synergistically coupling the 3D MXene with electrochemically active phases such as metal oxide/phosphides, noble metals, or sulfur yields the hybrid systems with greatly boosted active surface area, charge-transfer kinetics, and mass diffusion rate. Specifically, the CoP-3D MXene hybrids exhibit high electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen and hydrogen evolution in alkaline electrolyte.

A selection rule among surface chemistries is compatibility between a surface functionalization tool and a target material. For example, alkanethiol deposition on noble metal surfaces, widely known as the formation of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), cannot be performed on oxide material surfaces. One must choose organosilane molecules to functionalize oxide surfaces. Thus, the surface chemistry strictly depends on the properties of the surface. Polydopamine coating is now generally accepted as the first toolbox for functionalization of virtually any material surface. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is a widely used method to modify properties of versatile surfaces, including organic materials, metal oxides, and noble metals, along with polydopamine coating. On flat solid substrates, the two chemistries of polydopamine coating and LbL assembly provide similar levels of surface modifications. However, there are additional distinct features in polydopamine. First, polydopamine coating is effective for two- or three-dimensional porous materials such as metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), synthetic polyolefin membranes, and others because small-sized dopamine (MW = 153.18 u) and its oxidized oligomers are readily attached onto narrow-spaced surfaces without exhibiting steric hindrance. In contrast, polymers used in LbL assembly are slow in diffusion because of steric hindrance due to their high molecular weight. Second, it is applicable to structurally nonflat surfaces showing special wettability such as superhydrophobicity or superoleophobicity. Third, a nonconducting, insulating polydopamine layer can be converted to be a conducting layer by pyrolysis. The product after pyrolysis is a N-doped graphene-like material that is useful for graphene or carbon nanotube-containing composites. Fourth, it is a suitable method for engineering the surface properties of various composite materials. The surface properties of participating components in composite materials can be unified by polydopamine coating with a simple one-step process. Fifth, a polydopamine layer exhibits intrinsic chemical reactivity by the presence of catecholquinone moieties and catechol radical species on surfaces. Nucleophiles such as amine and thiolate spontaneously react with the functionalized layer.\nApplications of polydopamine coating are exponentially growing and include cell culture/patterning, microfluidics, antimicrobial surfaces, tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, photothermal therapy, immobilization of photocatalysts, Li-ion battery membranes, Li\u2013sulfur battery cathode materials, oil/water separation, water detoxification, organocatalysts, membrane separation technologies, carbonization, and others. In this Account, we describe various polydopamine coating methods and then introduce a number of chemical derivatives of dopamine that will open further development of material-independent surface chemistry.", "Thermochemical energy storage has a high material-related energy density and low energy losses over time compared to sensible and latent energy storage. Considering economic and ecological aspects, there is a great opportunity in using low cost or even waste materials from the mining industry, as thermochemical energy storage medium. In this study, a systematic analysis of a high carnallite-bearing material, comparable to the natural waste, for thermochemical energy storage was performed. The material displays gradual decomposition and poor reversibility of hydration reaction at temperatures above 150 \u00b0C. However, the reversibility is significantly higher and the decomposition is slower between 100 and 150 \u00b0C under pH2O = 25 kPa. The reversible behavior of the hydration reaction of carnallite, between 100 and 150 \u00b0C, is stable for 15 cycles when the material is exposed at 150 \u00b0C for short periods of time (t < 20 min). Following this path, any potential application of this material is definitely limited to low temperature thermal storage or thermal upgrade. Taking the low material cost into account, one of the potential applications of this material could be in the context of long-term heat storage. For this purpose, the temperatures of dehydration can be below 150 \u00b0C and the temperatures of rehydration close to 40 \u00b0C.", "In 2012, the National Science Foundation (NSF) created a new cross-directorate initiative\u2014Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering, and Materials (SusChEM)\u2014within its Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) portfolio.

In this work, carboxylated cellulose nanofiber (CNF) with the highest aspect ratio of 144 was extracted from wasted ginger fibers by a simple one-step acid hydrolysis. Our approach could easily make the carboxylated CNF assemble into robust bulk aerogels with tunable densities and desirable shapes on a large scale (3D macropores to mesopores) by hydrogen bonds. Excitingly, these CNF aerogels had better compression mechanical properties (99.5 kPa at 80% strain) and high shape recovery.

The enrichment of peptides can increase the detection efficiency and is sometimes indispensable for collecting the information on proteins with low-abundance. Herein, we first report that functionalized periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) materials have a superior peptide enrichment property. It is demonstrated that the PMO materials with an organo-bridged (\u2212CH2\u2212) hybrid wall composition display a highly enhanced peptide enrichment ability compared to the pure silica material (SBA-15) with similar mesostructured parameters and morphology. More importantly, by surface modification of PMO with amino groups (denoted NH2\u2212PMO), PMO and NH2\u2212PMO with opposite charged surfaces (\u221225.2 and +39.0 mV, respectively) show selective affinities for positively and negatively charged peptides, respectively. By directly adding PMO, NH2\u2212PMO as well as pure silica materials to the peptides solution with a low concentration (1\u22122 fmol/\u03bcL), 36 and 28 peptides can be detected from the BSA digestion in the presence of PMO and NH2\u2212PMO, respectively, while only 6 and 4 are monitored in the case of SBA-15 enrichment and from solution without enrichment, respectively.

However, it is still challenging to extend the conventional nanowire-transfer method to the fabrication of a wide range of devices since a chemical-adhesion-based nanowire-transfer mechanism is complex and time-consuming, hindering successful transfer of diverse nanowires made of various materials. Here, we introduce a material-independent mechanical-interlocking-based nanowire-transfer (MINT) method, fabricating ultralong and fully aligned nanowires on a large flexible substrate (2.5 \u00d7 2 cm2) in a highly robust manner. For the material-independent nanotransfer, we developed a mechanics-based nanotransfer method, which employs a dry-removable amorphous carbon (a-C) sacrificial layer between a vacuum-deposited nanowire and the underlying master mold. The controlled etching of the sacrificial layer enables the formation of a mechanical-interlocking structure under the nanowire, facilitating peeling off of the nanowire from the master mold robustly and reliably. Using the developed MINT method, we successfully fabricated various metallic and semiconductor nanowire arrays on flexible substrates. We further demonstrated that the developed method is well suited to the reliable fabrication of highly flexible and high-performance nanoelectronic devices. As examples, a fully aligned gold (Au) microheater array exhibited high bending stability (106 cycling) and ultrafast (\u223c220 ms) heating operation up to \u223c100 \u00b0C.

Stepwise shifts in the isosbestic point were consistently observed with the number of imine groups in the first and second layers of the generation-4 dendrimer (DPAG4). DPAG2 and DPAG3 were also found to trap 6 equiv of ferroceniums. To investigate the complexation, UV\u2212vis spectroscopy, 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and fluorescence spectroscopy were performed. We confirmed that neutral ferrocenes cannot complex with the imine group while ferroceniums can. Utilizing the redox property of ferrocenes, we were able to electrochemically control the encapsulation and release of ferrocenes into the DPA in a manner similar to redox-responsive proteins such as ferritin. In addition to ferrocenes, oligoferrocenes could also be trapped in the DPA. The biferrocene cation(1+) was particularly suitable for electrochemical switching due to its stable mixed valence condition. The terferrocene dication(2+) encapsulated into DPAG4 could be fabricated into a thin film, which exhibited the near-infrared absorption of an intervalence charge-transfer (IV-CT) band, pointing the way toward the use of such systems in material science.", "This research demonstrates that V2O5 is able to serve as hole transporting material to substitute organic transporting materials for Sb2S3 solar cells, offering all inorganic solar cells. The V2O5 thin film is prepared by thermal decomposition of spin-coated vanadium(V) triisopropoxide oxide solution. Mechanistic investigation shows that heat treatment of V2O5 layer has crucial influence on the power conversion efficiency of device. Low temperature annealing is unable to remove the organic molecules that increases the charge transfer resistance, while high temperature treatment leads to the increase of work function of V2O5 that blocks hole transporting from Sb2S3 to V2O5. Electrochemical and compositional characterizations show that the interfacial contact of V2O5/Sb2S3 can be essentially improved with appropriate annealing. The optimized power conversion efficiency of device based on Sb2S3/V2O5 heterojunction reaches 4.8%, which is the highest power conversion efficiency in full inorganic Sb2S3-based solar cells with planar heterojunction solar cells. Furthermore, the employment of V2O5 as hole transporting material leads to significant improvement in moisture stability compared with the device based organic hole transporting material.

The red regions to the left represent some as yet unknown dirty substance, while the turquoise regions to the right are composed of relatively pure ice chunks. The dirt bears striking resemblance to material that Cassini detected on Saturn's moon Phoebe, suggesting that the rings may, like Phoebe, have origins in the outer solar system.\nCassini also sent back visible and infrared images of the surface of Saturn's giant moon Titan, which is normally obscured by a heavy nitrogen-and-methane atmosphere. To their surprise, scientists discovered that previously observed dark patches are not hydrocarbon lakes, as was thought. Rather, they are areas of relatively pure water ice, while hydrocarbons likely exist in the brighter regions.\nThe spacecraft will spend the next four years ...", "Multi-interlocked circular DNA structures have been in high demand for fabricating complicated functional DNA architectures and nanodevices such as molecular switches, shuttles, and motors. Even though various innovative methods have been developed in the past, creation of multi-interlocked circular DNA structures with defined numbers of DNA molecules and linking patterns is still a challenging task nowadays. Here, we propose a top-down decatenation of kinetoplast DNA as a new approach for creating multi-interlocked circular DNA structures. Through optimizing the amount and reaction time of topoisomerase II, we synthesized completely mutually interlocked tricircular, tetra-circular, and oligo-circular DNA structures, which have not yet been acquirable through any other existing synthetic means. The catenation structures of multiple circular DNA were further verified through atomic force microscopic analysis of the backbone overlapping patterns and the circumference. It accordingly is our expectation that the top-down enzymatic approaches could offer a highly interlocked network with defined numbers of circular DNA with simple protocols, and could consequently be beneficial to the design and fabrication of sophisticated functional molecules and nanodevices in the areas of supramolecular chemistry, DNA nanotechnology, and material science.", "Research for chemical reports and case study analysis of chemical topics are two commonly used learning activities to engage and enrich student understanding of the content in introductory chemistry courses. Even though movies are excellent vehicles for exploring the human dimension of events, they have been used only sparingly as source material in introductory science courses. One reason for this sparing use has been the lack of a list of suitable movies. To fill this void, a list of one dozen highly rated movies is presented. The focus of these movies is either a scientist's chemical research or the societal impact of some chemical compound. The method by which two of these movies were used as source material for a written report in a general chemistry course is described.

We achieve this elusive goal by codoping a Jahn\u2013Teller Mn3+ and Nb5+ pair for two Ti4+ ions in ferroelectric BaTiO3. Representing a charge-neutral dipole doping, this approach achieves for the first time a bulk ferroelectric oxide with the lowest band gap of 1.66 eV with a sizable polarization of nearly 70% of BaTiO3. We contrast this with the analogous system with Mn3+ replaced by the non-Jahn\u2013Teller Fe3+ (3d5) ion, which even at a much lower level of doping reduces the polarization to 25% without reducing the band gap significantly, establishing the efficacy of the present strategy.", "To simultaneously achieve high compaction density and superior rate performance, a structure-gradient LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode material composed by a compacted core and an active-plane-exposing shell was designed and synthesized via a secondary co-precipitation method successfully.

Antoine M. van Oijen and coworkers at Leiden University used single-molecule fluorescence-excitation spectroscopy to reveal the electronic structure of an individual pigment-protein antenna complex, known as light-harvesting complex 2 (LH2), that the bacteria use to absorb photons [ Science , 285, 400 (1999)]. The LH2 complex transfers absorbed light energy to another lightharvesting antenna complex (LH1), which surrounds the photosynthetic reaction center that converts light energy into chemical energy. LH2 contains two rings of bacteriochlorophyll pigments, one with nine and one with 18 molecules. The Leiden group's results resolve a long-standing question, van Oijen says, by showing that the excited states of the nine-membered ring are localized on individual molecules, whereas in the 18-membered ring excitation is delocalized over the whole ring. Delocalization may contribute to the high efficiency of energy transfer ...", "Light sweeps liquid drops across a surface\nScientists have created a light \"broom\" that sweeps macroscopic liquid droplets across a specially modified flat solid surface. The broom may have numerous chemical applications, including lab-on-a-chip technology.

The key to the motion is a substrate modified with a calix [4] resorcinarene derivative containing photochromic azobenzene units (shown). The azobenzenes shift from the cis to the trans isomer in response to blue light (436 nm), which in turn changes the surface tension of the liquid droplets. If the light is directional, the resulting difference in surface tension between the front and back of the droplet causes it to move.

Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic\u2013inorganic lead halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention. Incorporating the chiral organic ligands into the layered lead iodide frameworks would introduce strong chirality in pure 2D perovskites for potential applications in circularly polarized light (CPL) emission and detection; nonetheless, studies on those aspects are still in their infancy. Here, we report on the strong CPL emission and sensitive CPL detection in the visible-wavelength range in pure chiral (R-/S-MBA)2PbI4 (MBA = C6H5C2H4NH3) 2D perovskites, which are successfully synthesized with a needle shape and millimeter size by incorporating the chiral molecules. The chiral 2D perovskites (R-MBA)2PbI4 and (S-MBA)2PbI4 exhibit an average degree of circularly polarized photoluminescence (PL) of 9.6% and 10.1% at 77 K, respectively, and a maximum degree of the circularly polarized PL of 17.6% is achieved in (S-MBA)2PbI4. The degree of circularly polarized PL dramatically decreases with increasing temperature, implying that the lattice distortion induced by the incorporated chiral molecules and/or temperature-dependent spin flipping might be the origin for the observed chirality. Finally, CPL detection has been achieved with decent performance in our chiral 2D perovskite microplate/MoS2 heterostructural devices. The high degree of the circularly polarized PL and excellent CPL detection together with the layered nature of pure chiral 2D perovskites enables them to be a class of very promising materials for developing and exploring spin associated electronic devices based on the chiral 2D perovskites.", "Objectives, format, and activities of a laboratory-based, first course in forensic science.

The constant sum constraint restricts the sampling space to a simplex instead of the usual Euclidean space. Since statistical measures such as mean and standard deviation are defined for the Euclidean space, traditional correlation studies, multivariate analysis, and hypothesis testing may lead to erroneous dependencies and incorrect inferences when applied to compositional data. Furthermore, composition measurements that are used for data analytics may not include all of the elements contained in the material; that is, the measurements may be subcompositions of a higher-dimensional parent composition. Physically meaningful statistical analysis must yield results that are invariant under the number of composition elements, requiring the application of specialized statistical tools. We present specifics and subtleties of compositional data processing through discussion of illustrative examples. We introduce basic concepts, terminology, and methods required for the analysis of compositional data and utilize them for the spatial interpolation of composition in a sputtered thin film.

We reassess the \u201cviscoelastic trumpet\u201d model (de Gennes, P.-G. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris1988, 307, 1949), to express the viscous energy dissipated in the bulk as a function of the rheological moduli of the material, involving the local frequencies of solicitation during crack propagation. We deduce from this integral expression the adhesion energy for different kind of materials:\u2009 (i) we show that, for a cross-linked polymer, the dissipation had been underestimated at low velocities. Indeed, the interface toughness G(V) starts from a relatively low value, G0, due to local processes near the fracture tip, and rises up to a maximum of order G0(\u03bc\u221e/\u03bc0) (where \u03bc0 and \u03bc\u221e stand for the elastic modulus of the material, respectively at low and high strain frequencies). This enhancement of fracture energy is due to far-field viscous dissipation in the bulk material, and begins for peel-rates V much lower than previously thought. (ii) For a polymer melt, the adhesion energy is predicted to scale as 1/V. In the second part of this paper, we compare some of these latest theoretical predictions with experimental results about the viscoelastic adhesion between a poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer melt and a glass surface. In particular, the expected dependence of the fracture energy vs separation rate is confirmed by the experimental data, and the observed changes in the concavity of the crack profile are in good agreement with our simple model. More generally, beyond the qualitative an simple picture sued for our approach, we expect our theoretical treatment to apply for relatively weak viscoelastic adhesives, for which the crack-tip dissipative term G0 is weakly dependent on the fracture velocity.", "Isotope ratios reveal origins of cocaine\nCarbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in cocaine (shown below) offer a signature distinctive enough to identify the region where the material was grown.

Here, we report H2V3O8, or V3O7\u00b7H2O, as a high-energy cathode material for MIBs. It exhibits reversible magnesiation\u2013demagnesiation behavior with an initial discharge capacity of 231 mAh g\u20131 at 60 \u00b0C, and an average discharge voltage of \u223c1.9 V vs Mg/Mg2+ in an electrolyte of 0.5 M Mg(ClO4)2 in acetonitrile, resulting in a high energy density of 440 Wh kg\u20131. The structural water remains stable during cycling. The crystal structure for Mg0.97H2V3O8 is determined for the first time. Bond valence sum difference mapping shows facile conduction pathways for Mg ions in the structure. The high performance of this material with its distinct crystal structure employing water\u2013metal bonding and hydrogen bonding provides insights to search for new oxide-based stable and high-energy materials for MIBs.", "The Malta Conferences, formally known as \u201cFrontiers of Science: Research and Education in the Middle East,\u201d have taken place biennially since 2003, at which approximately 85 scientists and science educators, including students and early-career scientists, from 15 Middle Eastern nations (Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates) meet for five days with six Nobel Laureates. The purpose of the Conferences is to provide a forum for the discussion of scientific and educational issues of importance to the region and the world that transcend geopolitical boundaries and international politics, and for the development of collaborations among the participants. The topics that are discussed include air and water quality, renewable energy sources, bio-medicinal chemistry, nanotechnology and material science, chemistry safety and security, and chemistry education at all levels. The Conferences are dedicated to the use of science diplomacy as a bridge toward peace in that troubled and very important region of the world. They feature plenary lectures by the Nobel Laureates, workshops, oral and poster presentations by participants from the Middle East, and ample time for everyone to make personal and professional connections. The result over the past decade has been the establishment of international cooperation in areas of basic and applied research that hold promise for the development of innovative products, processes, and educational resources. Prior to 2011, the Conferences were organized by a committee with representatives from the American Chemical Society (ACS), the Royal Society of Chemisry of Great Britain (RSC), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), and the German Chemical Society (GDCh); since that time, they have been organized by the Malta Conferences Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization incorporated in Washington, DC www.MaltaConferencesFoundation.org/.", "Analytical science has gone through several turning points, one of the most decisive of which was signaled by the development and massive use of instruments for analytical purposes. One other pivotal turning point was the inception of computer science, which not only enabled the automatic control of analytical systems but also facilitated the acquisition of vast amounts of data and their processing with the aid of chemometrics. Following the growing significance of automation and miniaturization in recent times, the early 21st century is witnessing the rise of nanotechnology as a new, increasingly important, revolutionary trend in science in general and analytical science in particular. The ability to exploit molecular interactions between analytes and nanoparticles has opened up new, challenging prospects in this area. Good proof of the interest aroused by nanoparticles is the large number of papers on their use in quantum dots, fullerene, aurum nanoparticles, or carbon nanotubes published in recent years.", "Charged nanocellulose (NC) with a high aspect ratio (larger than 100) extracted from animal or bacterial cellulose and chemical cross-linked NC aerogels have great promising applicability in material science, but facile fabrication of such NC aerogels from plant cellulose by physical cross-linking still remains a major challenge. In this work, carboxylated cellulose nanofiber (CNF) with the highest aspect ratio of 144 was extracted from wasted ginger fibers by a simple one-step acid hydrolysis. Our approach could easily make the carboxylated CNF assemble into robust bulk aerogels with tunable densities and desirable shapes on a large scale (3D macropores to mesopores) by hydrogen bonds. Excitingly, these CNF aerogels had better compression mechanical properties (99.5 kPa at 80% strain) and high shape recovery. Moreover, the CNF aerogels had strong coagulation\u2013flocculation ability (87.1%), removal efficiency of MB dye uptake (127.73 mg/g), and moderate Cu2+ absorption capacity (45.053 mg/g), which were due to assistance mechanisms of charge neutralization, network capture effect, and chain bridging of high aspect ratio carboxylated CNF. This provided a novel physical cross-linking method to design robust aerogels with modulated networked structures to be a general substrate material for industrial applications such as superabsorbent, flocculation, oil\u2013water separation, and potential electrical energy storage materials.", "Agonist-induced activation and endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are crucial for a number of physiological and pathological processes. However, tools that are available for probing GPCR endocytosis have been insufficient. Here, we developed a two-dimensional (2D) material agonist by supramolecular self-assembly between an endogenous agonist of \u03ba-opioid receptor (KOR) and 2D molybdenum disulfide. The 2D material agonist has proven to be amenable for eliciting GPCR activation and endocytosis in cells stably expressing KOR rather than in those without KOR expression. Using super-resolution microscopy, we also show that the 2D material agonist colocalizes well with GFP-fused KOR intracellularly. Further, the endocytosed 2D material agonist can selectively produce reactive oxygen species in cells that overly express KOR, as controlled by light irradiation.", "This paper discusses a K\u201312/university collaboration in which students participated in a four-day scenario-based summer STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) camp aimed at making difficult scientific concepts salient.

Despite the demonstrated need of this population, these students are not commonly served by university-sponsored science outreach programs. To address this omission, we developed a science outreach program called SciMentors that provides experiment-based lessons to existing science classes at adult learning centers, focusing equally on scientific concepts and critical thinking skills. SciMentors provides an opportunity for hands-on learning that would otherwise not be available to this population of students. The program is run by graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota. Evaluation of the impact of the program on both the students and the volunteer teachers was performed by surveying participants. Via the surveys, students reported an increase in knowledge of and interest in science as a result of the program, and learning center staff reported an increased attendance on science experiment days. Volunteers reported increased mastery in a wide range of skills including science communication, leadership, confidence, and cultural awareness. Now entering its fourth year, SciMentors has served over 60 adult learners, provided over 270 volunteer hours to the community, and received positive feedback from all involved.", "Cocrystallization of energetic materials has emerged as a strategy to modulate properties through directed selection of coformers. Here, the cocrystallization of a high-nitrogen energetic material, 3,6-bis(1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-ylamino)-s-tetrazine (BTATz), is detailed. The utility of electrostatic potential maps to predict the behavior of coformers with BTATz is demonstrated as well as a critical requirement for regions of sufficiently negative electrostatic potential on the coformer (Vs,min). Cocrystal structures are compared to the solvent-free structure of BTATz, determined here for the first time. The new materials exhibit good thermal stability (>200 \u00b0C) and are insensitive to impact. Cocrystallization of BTATz demonstrates the capability of high-nitrogen energetic materials to form multicomponent crystal systems and reaffirms the ability of coformers to modulate energetic performance.", "Nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) and nanotechnology are emerging fields that have captured the attention of scientists and engineers, as well as mainstream media.

It has been demonstrated in various chalcopyrite systems, including compounds with quaternary chalcopyrite-like structures, that the lattice parameter ratio, c/a, being exactly 2.00 to have a pseudo-cubic structure is key to increase the degeneracy at the valence band edge and ultimately achieve high TE performance. Considering the fact that ZnSnSb2 with a chalcopyrite structure is reported to have c/a close to 2.00, it is expected to have multiple valence bands leading to a high p-type zT. However, there are no complete investigations on the high temperature TE properties of ZnSnSb2 mainly because of the difficulty of obtaining a single-phase ZnSnSb2. In the present study, pure ZnSnSb2 samples with no impurities are synthesized successfully using a Sn flux-based method and TE properties are characterized up to 585 K. Transport properties and thermal analysis indicate that the structure of ZnSnSb2 remains chalcopyrite with no order\u2013disorder transition and clearly show that ZnSnSb2 can be made to exhibit a high zT in the low-to-mid temperature range through further optimization.", "Magnetism, when combined with an unconventional electronic band structure, can give rise to forefront electronic properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, axion electrodynamics, and Majorana fermions.

Representing a charge-neutral dipole doping, this approach achieves for the first time a bulk ferroelectric oxide with the lowest band gap of 1.66 eV with a sizable polarization of nearly 70% of BaTiO3. We contrast this with the analogous system with Mn3+ replaced by the non-Jahn\u2013Teller Fe3+ (3d5) ion, which even at a much lower level of doping reduces the polarization to 25% without reducing the band gap significantly, establishing the efficacy of the present strategy.", "Adult learners seeking a high school equivalency degree are a highly motivated group of students that almost universally meet outreach audience goals of serving minority, low-income, and other disadvantaged populations.

A team of researchers at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C., has devised a way to create a web of tiny crystals of ruthenium dioxide within the pores of a silica aerogel [ Nature , 406 ,169 (2000)]. Without blocking the interior spaces so important to the properties of mesoporous materials, the RuO 2 nanoparticles form an interconnecting pathway (shown schematically in gold within blue silica spheres) that exhibits pure electronic conductivity. \"Wiring the interior of a mesoporous insulator permits direct electronic control and monitoring of chemical reactions in the pores,\" notes Debra R. Rolison, head of advanced electrochemical materials at the lab's surface chemistry branch. \"For example, we show that our RuO 2 -wired silica aerogel serves as a porous catalytic electrode to electrosynthesize molecular chlorine from chloride.\" The researchers make the composite material by cryogenic decomposition of RuO 4 onto the nanoscale silica ...", "The compromises inherent in an interdepartmental Environmental Science major have led us to develop a novel one-semester junior-level course covering thermodynamics and the fundamental concepts of calculus.

Defects, such as part lattice distortions, local cation disordering and atomic ununiformity, often aggravate the further structural changes upon cycling. In this paper, we found that PEG contributed to form better layered structure, well crystallinity, uniform composition and polyhedral nanoparticles for Li[Li0.15Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 (LNMO). On the basis of the comparative trial, a mechanism of electronegativity difference is proposed to elucidate cation nonuniform distribution. Higher electronegativity of Ni (1.91) than Mn (1.55) show a stronger ability of attraction between Ni and O atoms, and then led to Ni atoms show stronger diffusion driving force toward particle surface to contact the rich O atoms during sintering in air. However, PEG polymer can form a better barrier for more O atoms to attract Ni and Mn atoms on particle surface so that facilitated a uniform distribution. The electrochemical test indicated that the decay of discharge capacity and working voltage was mitigated, which was identified by the result of HRTEM analysis that the initial less defect structure obviously retarded the phase transformation from the layered to spinel after 50 cycles. Therefore, defects are crucial for understanding the voltage fade and capacity decay, and the improvement of performance also demonstrates that designing optimum compositions and ordering atomic arrangements will contribute to stabilize the surface structure and restrain inherent phase transitions.", "For a reliable and efficient process for the recovery of energy and alkali of reed black liquor (BL), the experiments of reed BL combustion in a fluidized bed with limestone as bed material for direct causticization were conducted at temperatures from 700 to 900 \u00b0C. The products in the direct causticizing process were identified by XRD, and the recovery rate of alkali was measured. In addition, the mechanism of inhibiting bed material agglomeration was studied. The results show that a direct causticizing system successfully recovers NaOH when using limestone as bed material, and the recovery rate of NaOH is more than 87.4%. Na2O\u00b72SiO2 produced in the combustion process is the main binder of agglomeration. The limestone has a strong effect on inhibiting bed agglomeration, as the decomposition of limestone can provide CaO for the reaction with silica forming high-melting Ca2SiO4 and 3CaO\u00b7Al2O3\u00b73SiO2 instead of low-melting Na2O\u00b72SiO2.", "The U.K. National Crystallography Service (NCS) has developed a prototype e-science infrastructure for the provision of a small molecule crystallography service from sample receipt to results dissemination.

At present, the most commonly used luminescent anticounterfeiting technique is based on static photoluminescence (PL), which is easily counterfeited by certain substitutes. In this work, we report for the first time a dynamic PL material, Na2CaGe2O6:Tb3+. Irradiated by a portable ultraviolet (254 nm) lamp, the PL color of the material due to Tb3+ changes from the initial red to yellow and, finally, green. The investigation reveals that the dynamic PL is due to the presence of appropriate traps and the cross-relaxation effect of Tb3+ in Na2CaGe2O6. By employing this unique dynamic PL material, high-level dynamic luminescent anticounterfeiting and encryption devices can be fabricated. The dynamic PL features of the devices are easily detected using a cheap portable lamp, and at present, it is impossible for the features to be faked by any substitutes. In a virtual military scenario, the results demonstrate that the encryption device is safe and that a spy will be detected. Accordingly, this dynamic PL material could inspire more ingenious security designs.", "NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH Director Elias A.

In this contribution, we design a new monolayer Be2CO3F2 (BCF) by taking a KBe2BO3F2 unique crystal that is able to produce a high energetic laser by a direct second harmonic generation method, as a parent. The cohesive energy, positive phonon modes, and elastic constants reveal that the BCF monolayer is dynamically and mechanically stable, and the appropriate cleavage energy predicts the experimental realization possibility. The property investigations demonstrated that the monolayer BCF has the significantly superiority in flexibility over the representative flexible optoelectronic material MoS2 based on the calculation of Young\u2019s modulus. Additionally, the monolayer BCF possesses both a large band gap (5.2 eV) and a second harmonic generation response. These results demonstrate that the monolayer BCF may provide better applications as a promising multifunctional material in the flexible nonlinear optical fields.

Hence, numerous studies have been carried out to search suitable dopants to improve the performance; however, the explored dopants always cause phase separation and thus drastically reduce the reliability of phase-change memory. In this work, on the basis of ab initio calculations, we have identified yttrium (Y) as an optimal dopant for Sb2Te3, which overcomes the phase separation problem and significantly increases the resistivity of crystalline state by at least double that of Sb2Te3. The good phase stability of crystalline Y-doped Sb2Te3 (YST) is attributed to the same crystal structure between Y2Te3 and Sb2Te3 as well as their tiny lattice mismatch of only \u223c1.1%. The significant increase in resistivity of c-YST is understood by our findings that Y can dramatically increase the carrier\u2019s effective mass by regulating the band structure and can also reduce the intrinsic carrier density by suppressing the formation of SbTe antisite defects. Y doping can also improve the thermal stability of amorphous YST based on our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which is attributed to the stronger interactions between Y and Te than that of Sb and Te.", "T he U.S. President has a lot of say in determining the direction of federal support of science and technology programs.

The biferrocene cation(1+) was particularly suitable for electrochemical switching due to its stable mixed valence condition. The terferrocene dication(2+) encapsulated into DPAG4 could be fabricated into a thin film, which exhibited the near-infrared absorption of an intervalence charge-transfer (IV-CT) band, pointing the way toward the use of such systems in material science.", "Current discussion on how science is being practiced has focused on the issue of whether fundamental research is sufficiently relevant to societal goals. In this article, it is demonstrated that fundamental surface science, which seeks an atomic level understanding of surface processes, is to a significant extent strategic in nature. Examples of research in the areas of nucleation and growth, fundamentals of environmental remediation, semiconductor processing chemistry, and the development of new analytical tools are used to support this thesis. The argument is advanced that a broader implementation of strategic research is desirable and could be achieved though an articulation of societal goals which is clearer and more detailed.

The prepared PANi\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd NWs were explored to exhibit dual responsive enzyme-like efficiencies, e.g., peroxidase and oxidase-like activities. With the assistance of H2O2, the obtained ternary PANi\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd NWs were able to oxidize the typical peroxidase substrate of 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to yield the oxidized TMB with a blue color, exhibiting a much better peroxidase-like activity than the synthesized PANi\u2013MnO2 NWs alone and Pd nanoparticles owing to the interfacial electron transfer effect among the components. In addition, in the absence of H2O2, the prepared PANi\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd NWs could also oxidize TMB to display an excellent oxidase-like activity. Based on the dual responsive enzyme-like characteristic of the obtained ternary PANi\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd NWs, a rapid and applicative colorimetric way to sensitively determine l-cysteine and ascorbic acid (AA) has been developed.

Through optimizing the amount and reaction time of topoisomerase II, we synthesized completely mutually interlocked tricircular, tetra-circular, and oligo-circular DNA structures, which have not yet been acquirable through any other existing synthetic means. The catenation structures of multiple circular DNA were further verified through atomic force microscopic analysis of the backbone overlapping patterns and the circumference. It accordingly is our expectation that the top-down enzymatic approaches could offer a highly interlocked network with defined numbers of circular DNA with simple protocols, and could consequently be beneficial to the design and fabrication of sophisticated functional molecules and nanodevices in the areas of supramolecular chemistry, DNA nanotechnology, and material science.", 0, "Metal catalyst eases allylic rearrangement\nA ruthenium-based catalyst that was developed for environmentally friendly oxidations of alcohols also efficiently isomerizes allylic alcohols to aldehydes or ketones [ Angew.

Mesopores seemed to exert a positive influence on the humidity-regulating performance of the material from loess. Although calcination destroyed the original porosity of the loess, the porosity and thus the humidity-regulating performance could be recovered greatly through hydrothermal treatment.

In this unique material architecture, each component synergistically serves a specific purpose: The porous CNT network provides fast electron conduction paths and structural stability. The NiFe2O4 nanosheets afford strong binding sites for trapping polysulfide intermediates. The fine S nanoparticles well-distributed on the CNT/NiFe2O4 scaffold facilitate fast Li+ storage and release for energy delivery. The hybrid material exhibits balanced high performance with respect to specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability with outstandingly high Coulombic efficiency. Reversible specific capacities of 1350 and 900 mAh g\u20131 are achieved at rates of 0.1 and 1 C respectively, together with an unprecedented cycling stability of \u223c0.009% capacity decay per cycle over more than 500 cycles.", "Basic science in the general field of macromolecules includes the principles of their synthesis, the investigation of the size and structure of individual molecules in solution, and the relationship between structure and properties in the bulk phase.

While there are many reports of Mg cathodes, many times the evidence of intercalation chemistry is only circumstantial. In this work, direct evidence of Mg intercalation into a bilayer structure of V2O5\u00b7nH2O xerogel is confirmed, and the nature of the Mg intercalated species is reported. The interlayer spacing of V2O5\u00b7nH2O contracts upon Mg intercalation and expands for Mg deintercalation due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the divalent cation and the cathode. A combination of NMR, pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) confirmed reversible Mg insertion into the V2O5\u00b7nH2O material, and structural evolution of Mg intercalation leads to the formation of multiple new phases. Structures of V2O5\u00b7nH2O with Mg intercalation were further supported by the first principle simulations. A solvent cointercalated Mg in V2O5\u00b7nH2O is observed for the first time, and the 25Mg magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy was used to elucidate the structure obtained upon electrochemical cycling. Specifically, existence of a well-defined Mg\u2013O environment is revealed for the Mg intercalated structures. Information reported here reveals the fundamental Mg ion intercalation mechanism in a bilayer structure of V2O5\u00b7nH2O material and provides insightful design metrics for future Mg cathodes.", "At West Virginia University, a sense of belonging\nThe question of where to go to college comes up a lot at our house these days.

To explore its potential application as a solar cell device, we investigated the doping effect on the electronic properties of Si24 using first-principles calculations. It is found that Si24 can be easily doped as both p- and n-type, and the dopants are readily ionized. Furthermore, the incorporation of these dopants only reduces the band gap of Si24 slightly, which remains in the ideal region for solar cells. Boron and phosphorus are identified as the most promising elements for the p-type and n-type doping in Si24, respectively, due to their low formation energies, small ionization energies, and small reductions in the band gap. These properties suggest great potential in constructing a novel Si24-based p-n junction which is highly desired for future industrial application of photovoltaic devices.", "The lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) battery as a promising energy storage system has attracted intensive attention, but its development is still restricted by the electrical insulation of elemental sulfur and the severe shuttle effect caused by lithium polysulfides (LiPS) in ether electrolytes. In this work, a functional sulfur cathode using thiol-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTSH) is synthesized as the host material. Experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the thiol groups attached to carbon nanotubes can covalently bond with soluble sulfur species during cycling. Meanwhile, the conductive matrix of the carbon nanotubes provides a facile pathway for electron transport. The fabricated functional cathode material shows improved electrochemical performance. The discharge capacity still maintains 669.2 mAh g\u20131 after 300 cycles, accompanied with a low-capacity fading rate of 0.166% per cycle at 0.1 C, whereas the sulfur cathode material without thiol modification only exhibits 328.3 mAh g\u20131 under the same conditions.

This battery has initiated a rising interest in the development of sustainable paper-based energy storage devices, where cellulose is used as a combined building block and binder for paper electrodes of various types in combination with carbon, conducting polymers, and other electroactive materials.

The safety, stability, and capacity of lithium-ion batteries can be enhanced simply by using CC-based separators. Moreover, the high chemical modifiability and adjustable porosity of dried CC papers allow them to be used as advanced membranes for environmental science (water and air purification, pollutant adsorption) and life science (virus isolation, protein recovery, hemodialysis, DNA extraction, bioactive substrates).

Furthermore, the incorporation of these dopants only reduces the band gap of Si24 slightly, which remains in the ideal region for solar cells. Boron and phosphorus are identified as the most promising elements for the p-type and n-type doping in Si24, respectively, due to their low formation energies, small ionization energies, and small reductions in the band gap. These properties suggest great potential in constructing a novel Si24-based p-n junction which is highly desired for future industrial application of photovoltaic devices.", "Brillouin scattering measures the velocity and attenuation of hypersonic thermal acoustic phonons using light scattering. This technique has been applied now to many problems in polymer science. This chapter describes the theory and experimental procedures used in Brillouin scattering. Many examples are presented of the types of information that can be obtained. These include the adiabatic and isothermal compressibility, the volume and shear viscosity, and the ratio of specific heats for low-viscosity fluids. When the viscosity increases, the hypersonic glass-rubber relaxation is observed and it correlates well with other dynamic mechanical and dielectric data. Near the glass transition one can obtain the high-frequency limiting moduli for compression and shear, the Poisson ratio; and from measurements of the attenuation one can determine the homogeneity of the sample.", "In recent years, a significant challenge in material science has been to fabricate novel functional nanomaterials to mimic the function of natural enzymatic systems. Herein, ternary polyaniline (PANi)\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd nanowires (NWs) are synthesized through a two-step redox reaction process. The prepared PANi\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd NWs were explored to exhibit dual responsive enzyme-like efficiencies, e.g., peroxidase and oxidase-like activities. With the assistance of H2O2, the obtained ternary PANi\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd NWs were able to oxidize the typical peroxidase substrate of 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to yield the oxidized TMB with a blue color, exhibiting a much better peroxidase-like activity than the synthesized PANi\u2013MnO2 NWs alone and Pd nanoparticles owing to the interfacial electron transfer effect among the components. In addition, in the absence of H2O2, the prepared PANi\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd NWs could also oxidize TMB to display an excellent oxidase-like activity. Based on the dual responsive enzyme-like characteristic of the obtained ternary PANi\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd NWs, a rapid and applicative colorimetric way to sensitively determine l-cysteine and ascorbic acid (AA) has been developed. The limits of detection based on the two systems were estimated to be as low as 118 and 34 nM, respectively. We believe that the prepared ternary PANi\u2013MnO2\u2013Pd NWs with both peroxidase and oxidase-like activities will show broad potential applications in bioscience and bioengineering.", 0, "Despite tremendous accomplishments achieved in 2D materials, little progress has been made in carbonaceous 2D materials beyond graphene and graphene oxide. Here, we report a 2D material of carbonaceous nanoplates (CANP). The bottom-up synthesis of CANP is green, separation-free, and massive. The nanoplates are 2 to 3 monolayers thick with an average interlayer spacing of 0.57 nm. The synthesis involves viscosity-aided two-dimensional growth of fragmented glucose derivatives and leads to the complete conversion of glucose to the 2D nanoplates. Application tests demonstrate the usefulness of the affordable 2D material.", "We report a piezoelectric mechanism to stop dendrite growth, which enables inherently safe lithium metal battery. For demonstration, a polarized piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film is used as a separator. When the film is deformed by any local protrusion because of surface instability of the deposited lithium, a local piezoelectric over-potential is generated to suppress lithium deposition on the protrusion. Our optical in situ cell shows that a polarized PVDF film ensures lithium metal depositing to form a flat surface, even when starting from an uneven surface. In contrast, a nonpolarized PVDF film cannot suppress dendrite growth under the same condition, with dendrite penetrating the separator within minutes. Coin cell results further confirm that the piezoelectric mechanism is effective in practical battery applications. Analysis suggests that the effectiveness of piezoelectric mechanism by over-potential is easily 104 stronger than the maximum physical limit of mechanical blocking from infinitely stiff blocking materials, suggesting a new direction of material innovation.", "The past 10 years has witnessed a renewed interest in cellulose research and application, sparked mostly by technological interests in renewable raw materials and more environmentally friendly and sustainable resources. In this paper, we further expand the current knowledge in cellulose applications and technologies by reporting our discovery of cellulose as a smart material that can be used for biomimetic sensor/actuator devices and micro-electromechanical systems. This smart cellulose is termed electroactive paper (EAPap). It can produce a large bending displacement with low actuation voltage and low power consumption. The actuation phenomenon and its characteristics are illustrated in this paper. Because cellulose EAPap is ultra-lightweight, inexpensive, and biodegradable, it is advantageous for many applications such as micro-insect robots, micro-flying objects, micro-electromechanical systems, biosensors, and flexible electrical displays.", "I shall confine my remarks to the development of polymer science in America. There was considerable work before that in Europe, but that was before chemistry of polymers became sophisticated and real progress was made in the field. In about 1910 industrial work on polymers began to be carried out, although the understanding of polymers was very meager. The industrial work was done mainly on natural products such as horn and hoof and they were converted into useable materials by various means without much understanding of the real chemistry involved.\nHorns and hooves were the raw materials for the early polymer preparations. These materials were ground up and treated in various ways so that they could be fabricated into such items as combs to use for ladies' hair, and other specialty things of that sort.

This molecule has been found to have a low LUMO (Ea = 3.25 eV) and a deep HOMO (6.73 eV) energy level with a high triplet energy level (3.07 eV) and is thus very promising as an electron transport material for phosphorescent OLEDs. Preliminary studies show that B3T is indeed a very effective electron transport material for OLEDs where the green phosphorescent compound Ir(ppy)2(acac) is used as the emitter.", "A series of polyurethaneurea\u2212vinyl polymer (PUA) hybrid aqueous dispersions were synthesized from castor oil and/or difunctional poly(oxypropylene) polyol (GE-210, Mn = 1000), butyl acrylate, and styrene. The effect of hybrid between the polyurethaneurea (PUU) and vinyl polymer (PA) on the morphologies and the mechanical properties for these PUA films was examined and studied. The experimental results showed that there was appreciable miscibility between the PUU and PA phases for the PUA prepared with GE-210, giving rise to less ordered hard segments in PUU and resulting in lowering of some mechanical properties compared with those of pure PUU synthesized with GE-210. For PUA based on castor oil, the compatibility between the PUU and PA phases was also observed, although there was a network structure in the system. Moreover, the particle-accumulation morphology during the film formation process for this PUA system disappeared, but this behavior was found for a similar PUU. In this case, a great improvement of mechanical properties for such a PUA specimen was observed. The other PUA specimens with high content of castor oil exhibit excellent comprehensive mechanical properties, resulting from the reinforcement of cross-linked PUU phase existing in the systems.", "The native chemical ligation reaction (NCL) involves reacting a C-terminal peptide thioester with an N-terminal cysteinyl peptide to produce a native peptide bond between the two fragments. This reaction has considerably extended the size of polypeptides and proteins that can be produced by total synthesis and has also numerous applications in bioconjugation, polymer synthesis, material science, and micro- and nanotechnology research. The aim of the present review is to provide a thorough mechanistic overview of NCL and extended methods. The most relevant properties of peptide thioesters, Cys peptides, and common solvents, reagents, additives, and catalysts used for these ligations are presented. Mechanisms, selectivity and reactivity are, whenever possible, discussed through the insights of computational and physical chemistry studies. The inherent limitations of NCL are discussed with insights from the mechanistic standpoint. This review also presents a palette of O,S-, N,S-, or N,Se-acyl shift systems as thioester or selenoester surrogates and discusses the special molecular features that govern reactivity in each case.

The Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility (TA-50) supports TA-55 and the rest of the Lab by processing radioactive liquid waste. Designated as a Research and Development facility, the LANL Plutonium Facility (TA-55) is capable of small lot manufacturing. These three facilities are managed by the Plutonium Science & Manufacturing Directorate (ADPSM). An assessment of these facilities \u201cas-is\u201d material at risk quantities has been completed. Within TA-55 and TA-50, EPIcode results presented nine worse case scenarios for hazardous materials quantities, respectively. No opportunities for long-term reduction in hazardous materials were necessary at TA-22. A chlorine generator that is acceptable for use at TA-55 would eliminate the classification levels and protective action distances for chlorine. Purchasing potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide in containers that weigh 40 pounds or less at TA-55 and hydrochloric acid in 5 gallon containers or less at TA-50 would eliminate classification levels and protective action distances for these chemicals, as well. Pursuing these opportunities will result in a significant reduction of hazardous material containers; from 9 containers to 2. Sodium hydroxide inventory at TA-50 and nitric acid inventory at TA-55 cannot be reduced based on mission-essential needs, i.e., without increasing the overall risk to each facility. In the following report, a Hazardous Material Inventory Reduction approach for ADPSM facilities is outlined, recommendations for future opportunities to reduce chemicals are presented and hazardous material inventories that cannot be reduced based on mission-essential need discussed.

Large optical quality single crystals are subsequently grown from aqueous solution by a slow cooling method. The crystal has a bulky prismatic habit and among the prominent faces the c face appears as the only principal morphological face. The crystal exhibits a (010) cleavage. Dielectric spectroscopy reveals a nearly Debye type Cole\u2013Cole behavior with anisotropy in relaxation. Optical transmission range is found to be from 300 to 1400 nm.

With high in-plane stiffness and strength, but low flexural rigidity, two-dimensional (2D) materials are excellent building blocks for nanostructure engineering. They can be easily bent and folded to build three-dimensional (3D) architectures. Taking advantage of the large lattice mismatch between the constituents, we demonstrate a 3D heterogeneous architecture combining a basal Bi2Se3 nanoplate and wavelike Bi2Te3 edges buckling up and down forming periodic ripples. Unlike 2D heterostructures directly grown on substrates, the solution-based synthesis allows the heterostructures to be free from substrate influence during the formation process. The balance between bending and in-plane strain energies gives rise to controllable rippling of the material. Our experimental results show clear evidence that the wavelengths and amplitudes of the ripples are dependent on both the widths and thicknesses of the rippled material, matching well with continuum mechanics analysis. The rippled Bi2Se3/Bi2Te3 heterojunction broadens the horizon for the application of 2D materials heterojunction and the design and fabrication of 3D architectures based on them, which could provide a platform to enable nanoscale structure generation and associated photonic/electronic properties manipulation for optoelectronic and electromechanic applications.", "Semitransparent colorful organic solar cells (OSC) provide exciting opportunities for harnessing sunlight as colored windows.

However, the unsatisfactory mechanical performance of lignocellulose-based materials has limited applications in many advanced engineering domains. Herein, we demonstrate that layered bulk delignified nanolignocellulose/brushite composites with a multifold increase in strength and toughness. Our procedure contains the partially removable lignin and hemicellulose from the nanolignocellulose and the precipitating process of brushite on the nanolignocellulose surface via the mechanochemical process and flow-directed assembly followed by hot-pressing, resulting in the complete toppling of cell walls and the densification of the nanolignocellulose/brushite composites with highly ordered layered structures. This composite exhibits an ultrastrong specific strength 1.8\u20134.4 times higher than that of modified lignocellulose-based materials, which surpasses that of most natural structural materials and some metals and alloys, opening a path for production of ultrastrong lignocellulose-based load-bearing materials in practical applications by various farming and forestry surplus operations.", "Describes a literature course that concentrates on readings concerned with certain aspects of drug use and a science course that analyzes the problems associated with such drug intake.", "In the fall of 1930 the science departments of Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, moved into a completely equipped new building, the gift of C.

With a band gap of 1.72 eV, a 250 nm thick Sb2S3 photoanode showed a saturation photocurrent density of \u223c600 \u03bcA cm\u20132 measured at 1.0 V reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 under 1-sun illumination, with an onset potential of \u223c0.25 V RHE. However, subsequent photodegradation studies revealed that the material dissolves relatively quickly with the application of both illumination and bias. Nonetheless, Sb2S3 does have the advantage of having a relatively low optimal fabrication temperature of 300 \u00b0C and thus may have utility as a top cell absorber of a tandem device where the bottom cell is temperature sensitive, if protected from corrosion. Therefore, we characterized relevant aspects of the material in an attempt to explain the large difference between the theoretical maximum and measured current density.

Polypeptide with the GlyHisGly sequence was synthesized by chemoenzymatic polymerization and postfunctionalization of the His residues was performed to afford imidazolium butyrate on the side chains. The resulting zwitterionic polypeptide effectively dissociated bundles of tunicate cellulose nanocrystals, even when the conditions were mild and the concentration of the polypeptide was as low as 1\u20132 mg mL\u20131. Polypeptide treatment also affected the morphology of the cell walls in cultured plant cells, and the cellulose microfibril networks and amorphous polysaccharide layer were dissociated according to atomic force microscopy (AFM). The zwitterionic polypeptide treatment did not change the crystal structure of the cellulose nanocrystals. Analysis of the mechanical properties of the cellulose nanocrystals by force curve measurements using AFM revealed that the elastic modulus of the cellulose nanocrystals increased after treatment with the zwitterionic polypeptide, indicating that the amorphous part of the cellulose nanocrystals was removed by interactions with the polypeptide. At a concentration of the polypeptide that enabled the dissociation of the cellulose network, the zwitterionic polypeptide showed negligible cytotoxicity to the plant cells. The mild and noncytotoxic technique for loosening cellulose microfibrils/nanocrystals that was developed in this study has tremendous significance for the modification of cellulose in terms of polymer chemistry, material science, and plant biotechnology.", "Letters to the Editor that appeared within the print issues of C&EN have been included in C&EN Archives to provide a comprehensive representation of each issue.", "Software\nEssential Science Indicators is a Web-based evaluation tool that ranks scientists, journals, countries, papers, and institutions on the basis of citations.

The basis of the synthesis is to let silica monomers polymerize in the presence of an amphiphilic template component. In the first studies, cationic surfactants were used as structure inducer. Later it was shown that pluronic copolymers also could have the role. One advantage with the pluronics copolymers is that they allow for a wider variation in the radius of pores in the resulting silica material. Another advantage lies in the higher stability resulting from the thicker walls between the pores. Mesoporous silica has a very high area to volume ratio, and the ordered structure ensures surface homogeneity. There are a number of applications of this type of material. It can be used as support for catalysts, as templates to produces other mesoporous inorganic materials, or in controlled release applications.\nThe synthesis of mesoporous silica is, from a practical point of view, simple, but there are significant possibilities to vary synthesis conditions with a concomitant effect on the properties of the resulting material. It is clear that the structural properties on the nanometer scale are determined by the self-assembly properties of the amphiphile, and this knowledge has been used to optimize pore geometry and pore size. To have a practical functional material it is desirable to also control the structure on a micrometer scale and larger. In practice, one has largely taken an empirical approach in optimizing reaction conditions, paying less attention to underlying chemical and physicochemical mechanisms that lead from starting conditions to the final product. In this Account, we present our systematic studies of the processes involved not only in the formation of the mesoporous structure as such, but also of the formation of structures on the micrometer scale. The main point is to show how the ongoing silica polymerization triggers a sequence of structural changes through the action of colloidal interactions.\nOur approach is to use a multitude of experimental methods to characterize the time evolution of the same highly reproducible synthesis process. It is the silica polymerization reactions that set the time scale, and the block copolymer self-assembly responds to the progress of the polymerization through a basically hydrophobic interaction between silica and ethylene oxide units. The progression of the silica polymerization leads to an increased hydrophobicity triggering an aggregation process resulting in the formation of silica\u2013copolymer composite particles of increasing size. The particle growth occurs in a stepwise way caused by intricate shifts between colloidal stability and instability. By tuning reaction conditions one can have an end product of hexagonal prism composite particles with single crystal 2D hexagonal order.", "It is the exception rather than the rule that polymer chemistry is offered as a specific unit in undergraduate chemistry degree courses.

Laboratory activities designed in this manner often circumvent some of the main challenges that engineers and scientists face, namely balancing advantages and disadvantages for a variety of potential solutions to solve a specific problem. This activity was designed to show students that different solutions for a given problem can exist, and engineers must manage priorities when choosing the best solution. This laboratory involves cold casting ceramics slurries with varying viscosities into a mold. The resulting casts have a varying final density, controlled by the initial viscosity. Students are presented with different outcome measures regarding the objects they cast: ease of manufacturing, cost, aesthetics, and mechanical properties. Based on the laboratory design, no single cast will perform the best in all of these categories. The students are then asked to choose the best mold and justify their answers based on the initial problem presented to them by balancing which outcome measures they consider to be important for solving this specific problem. This laboratory teaches basic science concepts like viscosity and density, while addressing common industrial manufacturing issues, such as cost and ease of manufacturing.

Cellulose derived from wood or bacteria has dominated the industrial cellulose market and has been developed to produce a number of advanced materials for applications in energy storage, environmental, and biotechnology areas. However, Cladophora cellulose (CC) extracted from green algae has unprecedented advantages over those celluloses because of its high crystallinity (>95%), low moisture adsorption capacity, excellent solution processability, high porosity in the mesoporous range, and associated high specific surface area. The unique physical and chemical properties of CC can add new features to and enhance the performance of nanocellulose-based materials, and these attributes have attracted a great deal of research interest over the past decade.\nThis Account summarizes our recent research on the preparation, characterization, functionalization, and versatile applications of CC. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the uniqueness of CC with respect to material structure, properties, and emerging applications. We discuss the potential of CC in energy storage, environmental science, and life science, with emphasis on applications in which its properties are superior to those of other nanocellulose forms. Specifically, we discuss the production of the first-ever paper battery based on CC. This battery has initiated a rising interest in the development of sustainable paper-based energy storage devices, where cellulose is used as a combined building block and binder for paper electrodes of various types in combination with carbon, conducting polymers, and other electroactive materials. High-active-mass and high-mass-loading paper electrodes can be made in which the CC acts as a high-surface-area and porous substrate while a thin layer of electroactive material is coated on individual nanofibrils. We have shown that CC membranes can be used directly as battery separators because of their low moisture content, high mesoporosity, high thermal stability, and good electrolyte wettability.

In this method, the fuel itself flows through a cooling channel and is circulated around the combustion chamber. The channel is made of porous material that enables fuel to also partially flow directly from the channel to the chamber by transpiration, which cools the wall by internal convection. The exposure of the fuel to high temperatures results in fuel pyrolysis producing carbon particles (coke). These particles are transported by the fuel and deposit inside the pores of the material resulting in a decrease of permeability of the medium. This process is very complex since it affects the heat transfers which generate the fuel pyrolysis and the formation of the particles. A test bench is developed in the current work to study the transient effect of the key parameters (i.e., filtrating mass flow rate, a load of particles in the flow) on the particles\u2019 transport and on their spatial distribution inside the material. In the first part of the study, a porous medium with 3 mm thickness is used. It is found that with an increase in operational time, the powder mass accumulated inside the porous medium increases. In the second part of the study, different thicknesses (6, 9, and 12 mm) of porous medium are tried, to study its effect on particle transport. Particle transport is a function of pressure drop; therefore, the thickness of the porous medium is progressively increased at the same inlet mass flow rate which in turn modifies the pressure drop across the porous medium. More interestingly, the particles accumulate in the first 3 mm thickness of the upstream, while in the downstream on the opposite side of the porous material, almost no powder is found. Additionally, the pore Reynold\u2019s number inside the porous media and the Reynold\u2019s number of the fluid inside the permeation cell are determined to explain the transient and spatial evolution of clogging inside the porous media.

However, systematic investigations into the binding energies, site distribution, and their correlation with the molecular-level surface assemblages and structures at interfaces and in nanopores are rarely documented. In this review, we summarize a set of systematic calorimetric studies on surface energetics we performed during the past decade. These studies demonstrate how thermochemistry can reveal crucial energetic insights into a series of molecule\u2013material interactions relevant to a number of applications, including carbon capture and sequestration, energy production, sustainable chemical processing, catalysis, and nanogeoscience. Calorimetric methodologies developed and applied include direct gas adsorption calorimetry, near-room temperature solvent immersion/solution calorimetry, and high temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry. Using these highly unique techniques, we reveal the thermodynamic complexity of carbon dioxide capture on metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) sorbents with built-in and grafted nucleophilic functional groups (\u2212OH and \u2212NH2). These studies suggest that carbon dioxide adsorption on functionalized MOFs is a complex process involving multiple thermodynamic factors, as reflected by changes in surface phase and structure, chemical bonding, and degree of disorder with varying temperature and gas loading. The fundamental insights obtained may help optimize the design, synthesis, and application of MOF-based carbon dioxide sorbents for carbon capture and sequestration. In parallel, we also explore the energetics of interaction and competition between small molecules (water, carbon dioxide, methane, and simple and complex organics) and inorganic materials (calcite, silica, zirconia, zeolites, mesoporous frameworks, alumina, and uranium), at interfaces and in nanopores. Combined with spectroscopic, diffraction, electron microscopic, and computational techniques, the energetics of gas/liquid\u2013solid interactions can be correlated with specific bonds, molecular configurations, and nanostructures. Although the energetics evolves continuously from weak association to strong bonding to classical capping, distinct regions of rapidly changing stepwise energetics often separate the different regimes. These phenomena are closely related to the properties of inorganic material surfaces (hydrophobicity and acidity/basicity), the framework architectures, and the chemical nature of adsorbate molecules. These direct thermodynamic insights reinforce our understanding of complex small molecule\u2013inorganic material interactions important to multiple disciplines of chemical engineering, materials science, nanogeoscience, and environmental technology, including heterogeneous catalysis, molecular separation, material design and synthesis, biomineralization, contaminant and nutrient transport, carbonate formation, and water\u2013organic competitions on material/mineral surfaces.", "Steel is not elemental iron but rather a group of iron-based alloys containing many elements, especially chromium, nickel, and molybdenum. Steel recycling is expected to promote efficient resource use. However, open-loop recycling of steel could result in quality loss of nickel and molybdenum and/or material loss of chromium. Knowledge about alloying element substance flow is needed to avoid such losses. Material flow analyses (MFAs) indicate the importance of steel recycling to recovery of alloying elements. Flows of nickel, chromium, and molybdenum are interconnected, but MFAs have paid little attention to the interconnected flow of materials/substances in supply chains. This study combined a waste input\u2013output material flow model and physical unit input\u2013output analysis to perform a simultaneous MFA for nickel, chromium, and molybdenum in the Japanese economy in 2000. Results indicated the importance of recovery of these elements in recycling policies for end-of-life (EoL) vehicles and constructions. Improvement in EoL sorting technologies and implementation of designs for recycling/disassembly at the manufacturing phase are needed. Possible solutions include development of sorting processes for steel scrap and introduction of easier methods for identifying the composition of secondary resources.

Solid oxide fuel cells stand out because of their high efficiency and low emissions. In spite of the promise, to commercialize solid oxide fuel cells, the operating temperature needs to be reduced below 800 \u00b0C. Unfortunately, at such low temperatures the oxygen reduction reactions taking place at the cathode side of the solid oxide fuel cells are typically sluggish. Ferrites have recently shown that they can overcome this challenge. However, the conductivity of these materials is typically low. Here, we show by density functional theory calculations that substituting Fe in Ba1\u2013xLaxFeO3\u2212\u03b4 with P lowers both the O vacancy formation and vacancy migration energies and promotes the creation of PO4 groups. These factors contribute to improving the diffusional properties and oxygen reduction reaction performance.

Materials normally possess a positive Poisson\u2019s ratio - they contract laterally when stretched, and expand laterally when compressed. A negative Poisson\u2019s ratio is theoretically permissible but has not, with few exceptions of man-made bulk structures, been experimentally observed in any natural materials. Here, we show that the negative Poisson\u2019s ratio exists in the low-dimensional natural material black phosphorus and that our experimental observations are consistent with first-principles simulations. Through applying uniaxial strain along armchair direction, we have succeeded in demonstrating a cross-plane interlayer negative Poisson\u2019s ratio on black phosphorus for the first time. Meanwhile, our results support the existence of a cross-plane intralayer negative Poisson\u2019s ratio in the constituent phosphorene layers under uniaxial deformation along the zigzag axis, which is in line with a previous theoretical prediction. The phenomenon originates from the puckered structure of its in-plane lattice, together with coupled hinge-like bonding configurations.", 0, "\u25aa Organic cations replace metals in protein proton pump\nIn the absence of calcium or magnesium ions, the light-harvesting protein bacteriorhodopsin won't undergo the photocycle that normally enables it to pump protons across cell membranes. Now, chemists at Syracuse University have discovered that large organic cations can replace the inorganic ions, yielding analog proteins with spectroscopic and photochemical properties nearly identical to native bacteriorhodopsin [ J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 118, 2752 (1996)]. Robert R. Birge, professor of chemistry and director of the W. M. Keck Center for Molecular Electronics at Syracuse, research associate Eric H. L.

Govender experimented with a series of quaternary ammonium cations and bis(quaternary ammonium) cations corresponding to the structure R 3 N + (CH 2 ) n N + R 3 , where n = 2 to 4 and R = methyl, ethyl, or propyl. The divalent cations bind with higher affinity to the protein than the monovalent cations, the researchers find. ...", "Nitrides have attracted great attention due to their outstanding applications as superconductors, high-energy materials, and hard materials. Utilizing particle swarm optimization algorithm on crystal structure prediction in combination with first-principle calculations, a novel stable stoichiometry, AlN4 with space group P3\u03051c, is thermodynamically stable above 123 GPa and remains metastable at ambient conditions. Structurally, AlN4 is intriguing with the appearance of N8 with distorted double triangular conical columns and Al atoms sharing the same lattice hP4\u0305 with sodium. The metastable of AlN4 stems from the inherent stability of three-dimensional covalent bonded nets from N8 and Al\u2013N8. The new aluminum nitride with hardness of 45.7 GPa by Gao\u2019s model is a potential hard material. Interestingly, the band gap of AlN4 is becoming wider with increasing pressure.

Herein, Li-substituted and compositionally heterogeneous NaLi0.045Cu0.185Fe0.265Mn0.505O2 is used as a platform to investigate the interplay between Li substitution, surface chemistry, and battery performance. Li substitution improves the initial discharge capacity and energy density. However, there is no noticeable benefit in the long-term cycling stability of this material. The Li substitution in the transition-metal (TM) layer also seems to influence the transition-metal (TM) 3d\u2013oxygen (O) 2p hybridization. Upon desodiation, the surface of active particles undergoes significant transition-metal reduction, especially Mn. Furthermore, the presence of electrolyte drastically accelerates such surface degradation. In general, the Li-substituted material experiences severe surface degradation, which is partially responsible for the performance degradation upon long-term cycling. While some studies have reported the benefits of Li substitution, the present study suggests that the effectiveness of the Li substitution strategy depends on the TM compositional distribution. More efforts are needed to improve the surface chemistry of Li-substituted sodium cathode materials.", 0, "Two unique materials based on Mn4 single-molecule magnet (SMM) clusters (ST = 9) and integer or non-integer average valent platinum maleonitriledithiolate (mnt2-) complexes, [{MnII2MnIII2(hmp)6(MeCN)2}{Pt(mnt)2}2][Pt(mnt)2]2\u00b72MeCN (1) and [{MnII2MnIII2(hmp)6(MeCN)2}{Pt(mnt)2}4][Pt(mnt)2]2 (2), were synthesized by the material diffusion method and electrochemical oxidation, respectively (hmp- = 2-hydroxymethylpyridinate). 1 and 2 are comprised of four and six [Pt(mnt)2]n- units, respectively, in addition to a common MnII2MnIII2 double-cuboidal unit, [MnII2MnIII2(hmp)6(MeCN)2]4+ (hereinafter [Mn4]4+). Among the [Pt(mnt)2]n- units, two units in 1 and four units in 2 are coordinated with the [Mn4]4+ unit, forming a 1D chain of {\u2212[Mn4]\u2212[Pt(mnt)2]2\u2212} for 1 and a discrete subunit of {[Pt(mnt)2]2\u2212[Mn4]\u2212[Pt(mnt)2]2} for 2. The other two [Pt(mnt)2]n- units, occupying void space of the packing, form a stacking column with the coordinating [Pt(mnt)2]n- units, finally constructing hybrid frames of aggregates consisting of [Mn4]4+ units and [Pt(mnt)2]n- units. Electronic conductivity measurements revealed that 1 is an insulator and 2 is a semiconductor with \u03c3 = 0.22 S\u00b7cm-1 at room temperature and an activation energy of 136 meV. Detailed magnetic measurements proved that the [Mn4]4+ units in 1 and 2 behave as SMMs with an ST = 9 ground state at low temperatures. There is no significant interaction between [Mn4]4+ units and [Pt(mnt)2]n- units, but interactions between localized spins of [Pt(mnt)2]n- were detected even in 2 at low temperatures where the conductivity is electronically insulated. 2 is the first example of a hybridized material exhibiting SMM behavior and electronic conductivity.", "Fluorescent materials play an important role in biomedical fields. However, the main types of fluorescent materials suffer from several disadvantages especially the biotoxicity, which largely restrict its wider applications in biological fields. In this study, a highly efficient rare-earth-modified fluorescent material was successfully designed and fabricated based on polyhydroxyalkanoates, which are known as biodegradable and biocompatible materials. A new Functional-PHA polymer was microbially synthesized by engineered Halomonas bluephagenesis and was used as a basal matrix to generate the rare-earth-modified PHA. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine-grafted PHA (NAL-grafted-PHA) was first produced via a UV-initiated thiol\u2013ene click reaction and the rare earth metal ions (Eu3+ and Tb3+) were subsequently chelated onto the NAL-grafted-PHA through the coordination effect. The composite material exhibited intense photoluminescence properties under UV laser excitation, indicating the excellent features as fluorescent material. The enhanced hydrophilicity and superior biocompatibility of rare-earth-chelated PHA were confirmed, suggesting its great potential application value in biomedical fields.", "The candidate cathode material Li2MnSiO4 for lithium-ion cells was synthesized by an all-acetate precursor sol/gel method under a reducing atmosphere at 600, 700, and 800 \u00b0C. The material prepared at 700 \u00b0C was a pure phase and had the structural order of Li3PO4 orthorhombic (S.G. Pmn21) phase. The temperature dependence of the molar magnetic susceptibility of Li2MnSiO4 was found to be consistent with an antiferromagnetic material with a N\u00e9el temperature of 12 K. The calculated effective moment confirmed that the observed magnetic behavior involves Mn2+ ions in a high spin configuration in tetrahedral sites. Scanning electron microscopy of Li2MnSiO4 showed large aggregates (10 to 50 \u03bcm) composed of nanosized particles (100\u2212200 nm). The as-prepared material was almost electrochemically inactive despite the presence of 15 wt % carbon additive. The material was treated by carbon coating using cellulose carbon source precursor and particle size reduction using high-energy ball milling. In coin-cell tests, the carbon-coated and ball-milled materials yielded charge capacities of 190 and 172 mAh/g, respectively, under a current density of 10 mA/g. At present, the cationic mixing between Li+ and Mn2+ ions in their mutual crystallographic sites is the main impediment to the achievement of the full theoretical capacity of Li2MnSiO4 (333 mAh/g).", "The fluorination of arc-produced carbon material, which contained multiwall carbon nanotubes, was performed at room temperature by using a gaseous mixture of BrF3 and Br2. The elemental composition of the sample was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to be CF0.3Br0.02, while graphite is fluorinated up to a C2F stoichiometry under the same reaction conditions. The fluorinated carbon material and graphite fluoride were comparatively analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that only the outer shells of carbon nanotubes and polyhedral particles were fluorinated whereas the inner shells remained intact. We suggest that some of the arc-produced multiwall carbon nanotubes are composed of concentric cylindrical shells surrounded by nestled scrolls.", "In the fall of 1930 the science departments of Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, moved into a completely equipped new building, the gift of C.

Reverse saturable absorption and/or free carrier absorption were found to be the dominant contributor(s) to the optical limiting of the hybrid material.", "This paper presents a new type of flame-retardant ultraviolet (UV)-cured epoxy acrylate (EA) that contains microencapsulated phase-change materials (Micro-PCM); the Micro-PCM, which is based on a paraffin core and a melamine\u2212formaldehyde (MF) shell, was synthesized via an in situ polymerization method. To improve the thermal stability of the UV-cured EA/Micro-PCM composite, dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP), with or without octavinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (OVPOSS), was introduced into it. The Micro-PCM properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); the results showed that the MF was successfully fabricated on the surface of the core material, and the Micro-PCM contained \u223c70 wt\u2009% core material.

The critical penetration energy of monolayer membranes is determined using graphene and the 2D allotrope of boron nitride as case studies. Furthermore, the energy absorption scaling laws with a variable number of layers and interlayer spacing are investigated, for homogeneous or hybrid configurations (alternated stacking of graphene and boron nitride). At the nanolevel, a synergistic interaction between the layers emerges, not observed at the micro- and macro-scale for graphene armors. This size-scale transition in the impact behavior toward higher dimensional scales is rationalized in terms of scaling of the damaged volume and material strength. An optimal number of layers, between 5 and 10, emerges demonstrating that few-layered 2D material armors possess impact strength even higher than their monolayer counterparts. These results provide fundamental understanding for the design of ultralightweight multilayer armors using enhanced 2D material-based nanocomposites.", "The need for clean and efficient energy conversion systems has stimulated tremendous research activities in the area of energy systems. Solid oxide fuel cells stand out because of their high efficiency and low emissions. In spite of the promise, to commercialize solid oxide fuel cells, the operating temperature needs to be reduced below 800 \u00b0C. Unfortunately, at such low temperatures the oxygen reduction reactions taking place at the cathode side of the solid oxide fuel cells are typically sluggish. Ferrites have recently shown that they can overcome this challenge. However, the conductivity of these materials is typically low. Here, we show by density functional theory calculations that substituting Fe in Ba1\u2013xLaxFeO3\u2212\u03b4 with P lowers both the O vacancy formation and vacancy migration energies and promotes the creation of PO4 groups. These factors contribute to improving the diffusional properties and oxygen reduction reaction performance. We further successfully introduce P in the Fe-site of Ba0.95La0.05FeO3\u2212\u03b4 to make a novel cathode material, Ba0.95La0.05Fe0.95P0.05O3\u2212\u03b4.

A strong relationship between relative humidity and the alignment quality of a thin layer of azobenzenesulfonic dye has been investigated, where the photoinduced phase retardation, order parameter, and anchoring strength of the alignment layer are influenced dramatically by relative humidity. Our results provide fabrication guidance for the photoalignment process in both display and photonic applications. In addition, an exotic substantial ordering enhancement is observed by increasing the relative humidity without further light illumination, where the self-assembly of the photoaligned material incorporated with water molecules is the underlying reason for the enhanced high ordering (S > 0.8). Based on X-ray diffraction and depolarized optical microscopy observation, together with the photoalignment quality, a semicrystalline structure of the humidified azobenzenesulfonic material is proposed. The transition from amorphous solid at low relative humidity to semicrystal at high relative humidity provides a new perspective of understanding the hydrophilic photoalignment materials.", "To improve the electrochemical performance of the high energy Li\u2013O2 batteries, it is important to design and construct a suitable and effective oxygen-breathing cathode. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) porous boron-doped reduction graphite oxide (B-rGO) material with a hierarchical structure has been prepared by a facile freeze-drying method. In this design, boric acid as the boron source helps to form the 3D porous structure, owing to its cross-linking and pore-forming function. This architecture facilitates the rapid oxygen diffusion and electrolyte penetration in the electrode. Meanwhile, the boron\u2013oxygen functional groups linking to the carbon surface or edge serve as additional reaction sites to activate the ORR process. It is vital that boron atoms have been doped into the carbon lattices to greatly activate the electrons in the carbon \u03c0 system, which is beneficial for fast charge under large current densities. Density functional theory calculation demonstrates that B-rGO exhibits much stronger interactions with Li5O6 clusters, so that B-rGO more effectively activates Li\u2013O bonds to decompose Li2O2 during charge than rGO does. With B-rGO as a catalytic substrate, the Li\u2013O2 battery achieves a high discharge capacity and excellent rate capability.

Poor interlayer bonding is a common problem in MatEx printed parts, resulting from the deposition of heated material onto cooled material. MatEx is a thermally-driven process, wherein temperature profiles throughout a printed structure play an important role in determining structure and properties. Therefore, time-temperature information and heat transfer in MatEx have been investigated using experimental and modeling approaches. This chapter focuses on thermal modeling approaches that have been applied to MatEx. We describe MatEx, the importance of thermal profiles, processing parameters that are commonly adjusted, and commonly printed materials.

The sample material is ablated by the LTP probe and converted into an aerosol, and transported by a carrier gas flow to the ICP-MS, where the decomposed and ionized aerosol particles are analyzed with high sensitivity. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs reveal that the trace after ablation by the LTP probe is a hole with a diameter less than 10 \u03bcm.

Despite exhibiting these attractive characteristics, the practical applications of TMOs for supercapacitors are still relatively limited. This is largely due to their continuous Faradaic reactions, which can lead to major changes or destruction of their structure as well phase changes (in some cases) during cycling, leading to the degradation in their capacitive performance over time. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop new synthesis methods, which will readily provide stable porous architectures, controlled phase, as well as useful control over dimensions (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of the metal oxides for improving their performance in supercapacitor applications.

Advanced support materials facilitate the fabrication of such constructs. This work demonstrates the versatility and utility of a gellan fluid gel as a support bath material for fabricating freeform 3D hydrogel constructs from a variety of materials. Notably, the gellan fluid gel support bath can supply sensitive biological cross-linking agents such as enzymes to printed fluid hydrogel precursors for mild covalent hydrogel cross-linking. This mild fabrication approach is suitable for fabricating cell-laden gelatin-based constructs in which mammalian cells can form intercellular contacts within hours of fabrication; cellular activity is observed over several days within printed constructs. In addition, gellan is compatible with a wide range of ionic and thermal conditions, which makes it a suitable support material for ionically cross-linked structures generated by printing alginate-based ink formulations as well as thermosensitive hydrogel constructs formed from gelatin. Ultraviolet irradiation of printed structures within the support bath is also demonstrated for photoinitiated cross-linking of acrylated ink materials.

Bioconjugation of heparin with 6B-PDMAEMA occurred as soon as both aqueous solutions were simply mixed to form particles. The particle size at 25 \u00b0C was less than several hundred nanometers in diameter under a heparin/6B-PDMAEMA mixing weight ratio of over 2.5. The particles were very stable because of the prevention of hydrolysis of 6B-PDMAEMA in its bioconjugated form. Because the lower critical solution temperature of the bioconjugate ranges from approximately 20 to 36 \u00b0C for the formation of microparticles, the coating could be done in an aqueous solution at low temperatures. The excellent adsorptivity and high durability of the coating above 37 \u00b0C was demonstrated on silicone and polyethylene films by surface chemical compositional analysis. Blood coagulation was significantly reduced on the bioconjugate-coated surfaces. Therefore, the thermoresponsive bioconjugate developed here appears to satisfy the initial requirements for a biocompatible aqueous coating material.", "Many university science outreach programs involve presentations of research projects to high school students.

Poor interlayer bonding is a common problem in MatEx printed parts, resulting from the deposition of heated material onto cooled material. MatEx is a thermally-driven process, wherein temperature profiles throughout a printed structure play an important role in determining structure and properties. Therefore, time-temperature information and heat transfer in MatEx have been investigated using experimental and modeling approaches. This chapter focuses on thermal modeling approaches that have been applied to MatEx. We describe MatEx, the importance of thermal profiles, processing parameters that are commonly adjusted, and commonly printed materials. We then summarize thermal modeling approaches for MatEx, separating them into one-, two-, and three-dimensional (1D, 2D, and 3D, respectively), methods. Many approaches recommend higher temperatures to improve mechanical properties, while recommendations regarding print speed are mixed.", "The development of material science increasingly calls for rapid characterization methods with low limits of detection and high spatial resolution. Here we report a depth profile analysis method for thin layer coatings by combining low temperature plasma (LTP) probe with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The LTP probe with diameter of several tens of micrometers served as a tool for mass removal, which is generated by the discharge in a quartz capillary at ambient condition. The sample material is ablated by the LTP probe and converted into an aerosol, and transported by a carrier gas flow to the ICP-MS, where the decomposed and ionized aerosol particles are analyzed with high sensitivity. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs reveal that the trace after ablation by the LTP probe is a hole with a diameter less than 10 \u03bcm. A lateral resolution of approximately 200 \u03bcm has been achieved by analyzing an electron component with interval metal stripes. Depth profiling of a 100 nm single layer sample and a multiple layer sample (100 nm Al/250 nm SiO2/100 nm Au/50 nm Cr) on a silicon substrate have been successfully performed at ambient condition.

The most common examples of uses for enzymes in industry have been in food, pharmaceutical, detergent and textile processes. While these traditional uses of enzymes have sustained a vibrant scientific and technology community, recent advances in a number of areas suggest that an improved fundamental understanding of enzyme mechanisms, as well as new opportunities for applications for enzymes, are on the horizon. Illustrative examples of important recent advances in enzyme technology include: advancements in rapid screening and molecular evolution methods, new avenues for 'biomining' to obtain novel enzymes, genetic material from diverse and extreme environments, observations on reaction equilibria in nontraditional environments, and the push toward 'green chemistries'.", "Metal\u2013organic framework ZIF-8, from the zeolitic imidazolate framework family, shows a large intrinsic second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) response. In addition, ZIF-8 is a stable, inexpensive material that is transparent in the visible (vis) and near-infrared (NIR) window. This is crucial for NLO applications. The second-order NLO activity is due to the noncentrosymmetric octupolar symmetry of the material. We found that fast syntheses lead to a lower second-order NLO response. Consistent with polarized second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy measurements, we ascribe this to defects that create local centers of centrosymmetry but do not affect the orientation of the crystal lattice. Syntheses with slow nucleation lead to quasi-perfect crystals with a large average second-order NLO coefficient \u27e8deff\u27e9 of 0.25 pm/V, which is explained and supported by ab initio theoretical calculations.", "Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted significant attention for energy storage applications such as supercapacitors due to their good electrical conductivity, high electrochemical response (by providing Faradaic reactions), low manufacturing costs, and easy processability. Despite exhibiting these attractive characteristics, the practical applications of TMOs for supercapacitors are still relatively limited. This is largely due to their continuous Faradaic reactions, which can lead to major changes or destruction of their structure as well phase changes (in some cases) during cycling, leading to the degradation in their capacitive performance over time. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop new synthesis methods, which will readily provide stable porous architectures, controlled phase, as well as useful control over dimensions (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of the metal oxides for improving their performance in supercapacitor applications. Since its discovery in late 1990s, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have influenced many fields of material science. In recent years, they have gained significant attention as precursors or templates for the derivation of porous metal oxide nanostructures and nanocomposites for next-generation supercapacitor applications. Even though these materials have widespread applications and have been widely studied in terms of their structural features and synthesis, it is still not clear how these materials will play an important role in the development of the supercapacitor field.

Advanced support materials facilitate the fabrication of such constructs. This work demonstrates the versatility and utility of a gellan fluid gel as a support bath material for fabricating freeform 3D hydrogel constructs from a variety of materials. Notably, the gellan fluid gel support bath can supply sensitive biological cross-linking agents such as enzymes to printed fluid hydrogel precursors for mild covalent hydrogel cross-linking. This mild fabrication approach is suitable for fabricating cell-laden gelatin-based constructs in which mammalian cells can form intercellular contacts within hours of fabrication; cellular activity is observed over several days within printed constructs. In addition, gellan is compatible with a wide range of ionic and thermal conditions, which makes it a suitable support material for ionically cross-linked structures generated by printing alginate-based ink formulations as well as thermosensitive hydrogel constructs formed from gelatin. Ultraviolet irradiation of printed structures within the support bath is also demonstrated for photoinitiated cross-linking of acrylated ink materials.

Bioconjugation of heparin with 6B-PDMAEMA occurred as soon as both aqueous solutions were simply mixed to form particles. The particle size at 25 \u00b0C was less than several hundred nanometers in diameter under a heparin/6B-PDMAEMA mixing weight ratio of over 2.5. The particles were very stable because of the prevention of hydrolysis of 6B-PDMAEMA in its bioconjugated form. Because the lower critical solution temperature of the bioconjugate ranges from approximately 20 to 36 \u00b0C for the formation of microparticles, the coating could be done in an aqueous solution at low temperatures. The excellent adsorptivity and high durability of the coating above 37 \u00b0C was demonstrated on silicone and polyethylene films by surface chemical compositional analysis.

It is found that Ag4SSe allows a small amount of Ag deficiency inside the lattice without altering the initial crystal structure and phase transition feature. The stoichiometric Ag4SSe has a low TE figure of merit (zT) of 0.24 at 613 K because of the overhigh carrier concentration. Introducing Ag deficiency in Ag4SSe significantly lowers the carrier concentration, yielding a greatly enhanced Seebeck coefficient and suppressed carrier thermal conductivity throughout the entire measured temperature range. A maximum TE zT of 0.53 is achieved at 493 K for Ag3.96SSe, about two times that for the stoichiometric Ag4SSe.

Application of diverse spectroscopic techniques verified the successful formation of the CNH\u2013(H2P)2 hybrid material. In addition, thermogravimetric analysis revealed the amount of (H2P)2 loading onto CNHs, and TEM studies showed the characteristic secondary spherical superstructure morphology of the hybrid material. Efficient fluorescence quenching of (H2P)2 in the CNH\u2013(H2P)2 hybrid suggests that photoinduced events occur from the photoexcited (H2P)2 to CNHs. Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed the formation of transient species such as (H2P)2\u2022+ and CNH\u2022\u2013 by photoinduced charge separation in CNH\u2013(H2P)2.

For deterministic procedures that relate nanomorphology to synthetic conditions, it is necessary to express nano- and microstructures numerically. Selecting polyurea aerogels as a model system with demonstrated potential for rich nanomorphology and guided by a statistical design-of-experiments model, we prepared a large array of materials (208) with identical chemical composition but quite different nanostructures. By reflecting on SEM imaging, it was realized that our first preverbal impression about a nanostructure is related to its openness and texture; the former is quantified by porosity (\u03a0), and the latter is oftentimes related to hydrophobicity, which, in turn, is quantified by the contact angle (\u03b8) of water droplets resting on the material. Herewith, the \u03b8-to-\u03a0 ratio is referred to as the K-index, and it was noticed that all polyurea samples of this study could be put in eight K-index groups with separate nanomorphologies ranging from caterpillar-like assemblies of nanoparticles, to thin nanofibers, to cocoon-like structures, to large bald microspheres. A first validation of the K-index as a morphology descriptor was based on compressing samples to different strains: it was observed that as the porosity decreases, the water-contact angle decreases proportionally, and thereby the K-index remains constant. The predictive power of the K-index was demonstrated with 20 polyurea aerogels prepared in 8 binary solvent systems. Subsequently, several material properties were correlated to nanomorphology through the K-index and that, in turn, provided insight about the root cause of the diversity of the nanostructure in polyurea aerogels. Finally, using response surface methodology, K-indexes and other material properties of practical interest were correlated to the monomer, water, and catalyst concentrations as well as the three Hansen solubility parameters of the sol. That enabled the synthesis of materials with up to six prescribed properties at a time, including nanomorphology, bulk density, BET surface area, elastic modulus, ultimate compressive strength, and thermal conductivity.", "Optical memristive switches can be used as optical latching switches in which the switching state is changed only by applying an electrical Write/Erase pulse and maintained without an external power supply. We demonstrate an optical memristive switch based on a silicon multimode interferometer structure covered with nanoscale-sized Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) material on top. The phase change of GST is triggered by resistive heating of the silicon layer beneath GST with an electrical pulse. Experimental results reveal that the optical transmissivity can be tuned in a controllable and repeatable manner. Partial crystallization of GST is obtained by controlling the width and amplitude of the electrical pulses. Crucially, we demonstrate that both Erase and Write operations, to and from any intermediate level, are possible with accurate control of the electrical pulses. Our work marks a significant step forward toward realizing photonic memristive switches without static power consumption, which are highly demanded in integrated photonics.", "A multifunctional K\u2013Ni\u2013Cu\u2013hydrotalcite hybrid material was synthesized for hydrogen production via sorption-enhanced steam reforming of ethanol. The hydrotalcite material was used as support for the incorporation of nickel and copper, both used as active catalytic phases. This material was studied for its catalytic properties for steam reforming of ethanol; it was found that Cu preferentially catalyzes ethanol dehydrogenation and water\u2013gas shift reactions, while Ni is more suitable for acetaldehyde decomposition and steam reforming of methane. It was found that Ni and Cu formed a Ni0.5Cu0.5 alloy with the advantage of ensemble formation. Also, promising carbon dioxide adsorption capacity of the material was obtained. The potassium promoter together with the hydrotalcite material for carbon dioxide adsorption ensured a successful sorption-enhanced reaction process. High-purity hydrogen stream (99.8 mol % on dry basis) was obtained during the prebreakthrough period at 773 K with a water-to-ethanol molar ratio of 10 in the feed; the concentration of hydrogen then decreased to 67.1 mol % after the breakthrough period.", "Ag4SSe, named as aguilarite in mineralogy, belongs to the family of liquid-like superionic compounds at middle temperature, but its thermoelectric (TE) properties are rarely investigated so far. In this study, a series of Ag-deficient Ag4SSe samples have been synthesized by the melting\u2013annealing method. Their crystal structures, phase transition features, and electrical and thermal transport properties have been systematically investigated. It is found that Ag4SSe allows a small amount of Ag deficiency inside the lattice without altering the initial crystal structure and phase transition feature. The stoichiometric Ag4SSe has a low TE figure of merit (zT) of 0.24 at 613 K because of the overhigh carrier concentration. Introducing Ag deficiency in Ag4SSe significantly lowers the carrier concentration, yielding a greatly enhanced Seebeck coefficient and suppressed carrier thermal conductivity throughout the entire measured temperature range. A maximum TE zT of 0.53 is achieved at 493 K for Ag3.96SSe, about two times that for the stoichiometric Ag4SSe. The present study suggests that aguilarite Ag4SSe is a promising TE material applied at the middle temperature range.", "Pierre Duhem demonstrated that his ability to take new viewpoints was not limited to physical theory as he was also interested in the histories and philosophies of science.", "We report an efficient and adaptable method for the microencapsulation of active ingredients by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) shell material. The core\u2013shell microcapsules were obtained by phase separation between the core component and the PDMS shell components after repartitioning of the common solvent THF between the PDMS/core material phase and the water phase. For the shell components, two commercially available functional PDMS polymers containing thiol and vinyl side groups were used. Photo-cross-linking in the presence of 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA) by thiol\u2013ene radical addition was used to form a PDMS-thioether cross-linked shell. Variation of the PDMS component thiol to ene ratio resulted in different functionalities on the microcapsules surface and in the bulk, which was analyzed by attenuated total-reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) and high-resolution magic-angle NMR-spectroscopy (HR-MAS NMR). Organically modified silica particles were mixed into the PDMS shell, resulting in better mechanical properties of the shell and control over the shell permeability, as measured on the one hand by tensile testing of representative PDMS bulk samples of identical composition as the actual shell material and on the other hand by leaching experiments of the core compounds, such as a tetrathiol and the UV-absorber octocrylene, followed by UV\u2013vis.", "Considers three aspects of Adam's career that were of importance to the growth of American chemistry and of American science in general.", "Modern computer technology is based on the binary logic system.

The removal of copper, lead, and zinc was studied employing a cost-effective novel adsorbent based on waste printed circuit boards. The results indicate that the modification of the original e-waste material has a considerable effect on its surface area enhancement. Adsorption experiments revealed that the modified novel material had uptake capacities of 2.9 mmol Cu, 3.4 mmol Pb, and 2.0 mmol Zn per each gram of the adsorbent which are significantly higher values than its commercial counterparts used in industry.", "In response to numerous indicators, including findings from their own reports, that the scientific and technological building blocks critical to America\u2019s economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength, the National Academy of Sciences sought ways to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, and health professionals.

Initially, PTB7-Th, which contains an electron-rich unit as donor and an electron-deficient unit as acceptor with an easy separation of electron\u2013hole pairs and intermolecular electron transfer, provided an excellent photocurrent response. Subsequently, an input target thrombin (TB) was converted to an output single-stranded DNA by a protein converting strategy. The obtained single-stranded DNA thus triggered a rolling circle amplification (RCA) to form a tandem multihairpin DNA nanostructure, which could function as a skeleton for immobilizing manganese porphyrin (MnTMPyP). In the presence of H2O2 and aniline, a PANI layer could be in situ deposited onto the tandem multihairpin DNA nanostructure with use of MnTMPyP as catalyst, leading to a significantly enhanced photocurrent for the detection of TB. The proposed PEC assay presented a wide detection range of 100 fM to 10 nM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 34.6 fM. Furthermore, the proposed strategy provides a PEC analysis method based on PTB7-Th that can significantly improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency and opens an intriguing avenue to establish low background, ultrasensitive, and highly stable analytical techniques.", "IT WAS A TENSE , unsettling time.

In this work, we report the successful growth of layered ZrTe2 thin film by pulsed-laser deposition and the experimental results of its magnetotransport properties. In the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, the 60 nm thick ZrTe2 film shows a large magnetoresistance of 3000% at 2 K and 9 T. A robust linear magnetoresistance is observed under an in-plane magnetic field, and negative magnetoresistance appears in the film when the magnetic field is parallel to the current direction.

Such extremely scaled atomically thin devices are expected to show ballistic nonlinear behavior that could make them tremendously useful for ultrafast applications. While nonlinear diffusive electron transport has been widely reported, clear evidence for intrinsic nonlinear ballistic transport in the growing array of atomically thin conductors has so far been elusive. Here we report nonlinear electron transport of an ultrashort single-layer graphene channel that shows quantitative agreement with intrinsic ballistic transport. This behavior is shown to be distinctly different than that observed in similarly prepared ultrashort devices consisting, instead, of bilayer graphene channels. These results suggest that the addition of only one extra layer of an atomically thin material can make a significant impact on the nonlinear ballistic behavior of ultrashort devices, which is possibly due to the very different chiral tunneling of their charge carriers. The fact that we observe the nonlinear ballistic response at room temperature, with zero applied magnetic field, in non-ultrahigh vacuum conditions and directly on a readily accessible oxide substrate makes the nanogap technology we utilize of great potential for achieving extremely scaled high-speed atomically thin devices.", "Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit morphological and phenotypic changes that correlate with mechanical cues presented by the substratum material to which those cells adhere. Such mechanosensitivity has been explored in vitro to promote differentiation of MSCs along tissue cell lineages for direct tissue repair. However, MSCs are increasingly understood to facilitate indirect tissue repair in vivo through paracrine signaling via secreted biomolecules. Here we leveraged cell\u2013material interactions in vitro to induce human bone marrow-derived MSCs to preferentially secrete factors that are beneficial to hematopoietic cell proliferation. Specifically, we varied the viscoelastic properties of cell-culture-compatible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrata to demonstrate modulated MSC expression of biomolecules, including osteopontin, a secreted phosphoprotein implicated in tissue repair and regeneration. We observed an approximately 3-fold increase in expression of osteopontin for MSCs on PDMS substrata of lowest stiffness (elastic moduli <1 kPa) and highest ratio of loss modulus to storage modulus (tan(\u03b4) > 1). A specific subpopulation of these cells, shown previously to express increased osteopontin in vitro and to promote bone marrow recovery in vivo, also exhibited up to a 5-fold increase in osteopontin expression when grown on compliant PDMS relative to heterogeneous MSCs on polystyrene. Importantly, this mechanically modulated increase in protein expression preceded detectable changes in the terminal differentiation capacity of MSCs. In coculture with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that repopulate the blood cell lineages, these mechanically modulated MSCs promoted in vitro proliferation of HSPCs without altering the multipotency for either myeloid or lymphoid lineages. Cytokine and protein expression by human MSCs can thus be manipulated directly by mechanical cues conferred by the material substrata prior to and instead of tissue lineage differentiation. This approach enables enhanced in vitro production of both mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that aid regenerative clinical applications.", "YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE BEEN LOCKED in a cave for the past five years to miss Harry Potter.

Besides the numerous modules already available in VMS for the study of electronic, optical, vibrational, vibronic, and EPR properties, here the simulation of NMR spectra is presented with a particular emphasis on those techniques usually employed to investigate solid state systems. The SoSNMR module benefits from its ability to work under both periodic and nonperiodic conditions, such that small molecules/molecular clusters can be treated, as well as extended three-dimensional systems enforcing (or not) translational periodicity. These features allow VMS to simulate spectra resulting from NMR calculations by some popular quantum chemistry codes, namely Gaussian09/16, Castep, and Quantum Espresso.

The electrochemical performance of \u03b1-VPO4 as the anode material was examined in Li-, Na-, and K-based cells. The carbon-coated \u03b1-VPO4/C composite exhibits 185, 110, and 37 mA h/g specific capacities respectively at the first discharge and around 120, 80, and 30 mA h/g at consecutive cycles at a C/10 rate. The considerable capacity drop after the first cycle in Li and Na cells is presumably due to irreversible alkali ion consumption taking place upon alkali-ion de/insertion. The EDX analysis of the recovered electrodes revealed an uptake of \u223c23% of Na after the first discharge with significant cell parameter alteration validated by operando XRD measurements. In contrast to the known \u03b2-VPO4 anode materials, both Li and Na de/insertion into the new \u03b1-VPO4 proceed via an intercalation mechanism with the parent structural framework preserved but not via a conversion mechanism.

The catalytic activity of CuOx-CeO2 could be largely improved by doping indium oxide (In2O3). The reaction rate of 1.26 \u00d7 10\u20135 molCO gcat.\u20131 s\u20131 for a 1.25In5Cu/CeO2 catalyst toward CO oxidation is 12 times higher than that from commercial Pd catalysts. In addition, the indium-doped catalyst shows strong resistance to CO2 and H2O poisoning. We determined the dynamic interfacial structure of CuOx/CeO2 catalysts induced by In2O3 during CO oxidation using in situ techniques, intrinsic kinetics, and density functional theory calculations (DFT). Indeed, the surface of CuOx particles could be reconstructed through the interaction with In2O3. Such an interaction not only helps to generate more active sites at interfaces between CuOx and CeO2 but also lowers the CO adsorption strength and reduces the accumulation of surface carbonates. Meanwhile, In2O3 could also modify the electronic structure to improve the reducibility of CuOx, thus shifting the redox equilibrium of Cu2+ + Ce3+ \u2194 Cu+ + Ce4+ to create Cu+ or Cu0 species at the interfacial sites.

A specific subpopulation of these cells, shown previously to express increased osteopontin in vitro and to promote bone marrow recovery in vivo, also exhibited up to a 5-fold increase in osteopontin expression when grown on compliant PDMS relative to heterogeneous MSCs on polystyrene. Importantly, this mechanically modulated increase in protein expression preceded detectable changes in the terminal differentiation capacity of MSCs. In coculture with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that repopulate the blood cell lineages, these mechanically modulated MSCs promoted in vitro proliferation of HSPCs without altering the multipotency for either myeloid or lymphoid lineages. Cytokine and protein expression by human MSCs can thus be manipulated directly by mechanical cues conferred by the material substrata prior to and instead of tissue lineage differentiation. This approach enables enhanced in vitro production of both mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that aid regenerative clinical applications.", "Long-range hole transport (HT) through DNA is a well-established phenomenon with important applications in the fields of material science, biochemistry, and cell biology. However, the role that the surrounding environment plays in modulating DNA HT dynamics is not well understood and will impact the development of DNA HT theories. Here, we report that varying the bulk salt concentration can affect the dynamics of long-range HT in a mixed sequence DNA duplex. Using a previously described AQ-601 construct, we show that HT to distal guanines is maximal at physiological salt concentrations (100\u2212200 mM), and declines as [NaCl] increases or decreases. Using circular dichroism, we observe that the 601 sequence has the unusual property of underwinding with increasing salt, but the connection of these changes in secondary structure to DNA HT dynamics is not clear. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on decamer duplexes from AQ-601, we show that the changes in HT dynamics do not correlate with salt-dependent fluctuations in local DNA structure and/or electrostatic environment. Since the HT results best correlate with known changes in oxygen diffusion rates vs [NaCl], the rate of hole trapping, involving reaction of the guanine radical cation with oxygen species, appears to control the DNA HT dynamics in this duplex.", "In vivo incorporation of phenylalanine (Phe) analogues into an artificial extracellular matrix protein (aECM-CS5-ELF) was accomplished using a bacterial expression host that harbors the mutant phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) with an enlarged binding pocket. Although the Ala294Gly/Thr251Gly mutant PheRS (PheRS**) under the control of T5 promoter allows incorporation of some Phe analogues into a protein, the T5 system is not suitable for material science studies because the amount of materials produced is not sufficient due to the moderate strength of the T5 promoter. This limitation can be overcome by using a pair of T7 promoter and T7 RNA polymerase instead. In the T7 expression system, it is difficult, however, to achieve a high incorporation level of Phe analogues, due to competition of Phe analogues for incorporation with the residual Phe that is required for synthesis of active T7 RNA polymerase. In this study, we prepared the PheRS** under T7 promoter and optimized culture condition to improve both the incorporation level of recombinant aECM protein and the incorporation level of Phe analogues. Incorporation and expression levels tend to increase in the case of p-azidophenylalanine, p-iodophenylalanine, and p-acetylphenylalanine. We evaluated the lower critical transition temperature, which is dependent on the incorporation ratio and the turbidity decreased when the incorporation level increased. Circular dichromism measurement indicated that this tendency is based on conformational change from random coil to \u03b2-turn structure. We demonstrated that polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be conjugated at reaction site of Phe analogues incorporated. We also demonstrated that the increased hydrophilicity of elastin-like sequences in the aECM-CS5-ELF made by PEG conjugation could suppress nonspecific adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).", "Columbia University and Georgia Institute of Technology are planning what could become a million-dollar center to assess the practical benefits of science and technology programs.

The material showed different electrochemical mechanisms in the first charge and subsequent cycles. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) study showed that the Li+ diffusion coefficients during the first charge were as small as 10\u221219 cm2 s\u22121 because of the high kinetic barriers associated with the concurrent Li+ extraction, oxygen loss, and structural rearrangement. The Li+ diffusion coefficients increased to 10\u221214 cm2 s\u22121 after the first charge. However, they were still much smaller than those of typical layered materials such as LiCoO2 and Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study showed that the large interface impedance at high potential seriously hindered the electrode performance of the material.

Good agreement was achieved between simulated density, volume expansion coefficient, heat capacity, and diffusion coefficients and experimental values in order to validate the best performing force field.

This work suggests that there is a strong interaction between the NH2 of urea and the chlorine anion where the system wants to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds to the anion. Additionally, the disappearance of free carbonyl groups upon increasing concentrations of urea suggests that at low urea concentrations, urea will preferentially interact with the anion through the NH2 groups. As this concentration increases, the complex remains but with additional interactions that remove the free carbonyl band from the spectra.

Although upland placement sites are equipped with engineering controls (leachate collection and/or barrier walls), little is known of the potential impacts of this approach to air quality. The aim of this study was to estimate the flux of mercury to the atmosphere from New York/New Jersey Harbor stabilized dredged material (SDM) that was used for land reclamation at a site in northeastern New Jersey. Total gaseous mercury (TGM) was measured at a site receiving SDM in August and October 2001 and May and November 2002. TGM was also monitored at an urban reference site 3.5 km west of the SDM site in September 2001 and from February 2002 to July 2002 and from October 2002 to February 2003. The concentration of TGM at the urban reference site averaged 2.2 \u00b1 1.1 ng m-3, indicating some local contribution to the Northern Hemisphere background. TGM concentra tions exhibited seasonality with the highest values in summer (3.3 \u00b1 2.1 ng m-3 in June 2002) and the lowest in winter (1.7 \u00b1 0.6 ng m-3 in January 2003). TGM concentrations at the SDM placement site ranged from 2 to 7 ng m-3 and were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than those at the urban reference site. Sediment\u2212air fluxes of Hg at the SDM placement site estimated by the micrometeorological technique ranged from \u221213 to 1040 ng m-2 h-1 (sediment to air fluxes being positive) and were significantly correlated to solar radiation (r2 = 0.81). The estimated contribution of Hg emissions from land-applied SDM to local TGM concentrations was found to be negligible (<4%).

Indeed, the surface of CuOx particles could be reconstructed through the interaction with In2O3. Such an interaction not only helps to generate more active sites at interfaces between CuOx and CeO2 but also lowers the CO adsorption strength and reduces the accumulation of surface carbonates. Meanwhile, In2O3 could also modify the electronic structure to improve the reducibility of CuOx, thus shifting the redox equilibrium of Cu2+ + Ce3+ \u2194 Cu+ + Ce4+ to create Cu+ or Cu0 species at the interfacial sites.

However, the role that the surrounding environment plays in modulating DNA HT dynamics is not well understood and will impact the development of DNA HT theories. Here, we report that varying the bulk salt concentration can affect the dynamics of long-range HT in a mixed sequence DNA duplex. Using a previously described AQ-601 construct, we show that HT to distal guanines is maximal at physiological salt concentrations (100\u2212200 mM), and declines as [NaCl] increases or decreases.

Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on decamer duplexes from AQ-601, we show that the changes in HT dynamics do not correlate with salt-dependent fluctuations in local DNA structure and/or electrostatic environment. Since the HT results best correlate with known changes in oxygen diffusion rates vs [NaCl], the rate of hole trapping, involving reaction of the guanine radical cation with oxygen species, appears to control the DNA HT dynamics in this duplex.", "The sulfide perovskite LaYS3 has been recently identified as a promising wide band gap photoabsorber material by computational screening techniques.

This module is fully integrated with the graphical user interface of VMS (VMS\u2013Draw) [Licari et al., J. Comput. Chem. 36, 2015, 321\u2013334], a freeware tool which allows a user-friendly handling of structures and analyses of advanced spectroscopical properties of chemical compounds\u2014from model systems to real-world applications. Besides the numerous modules already available in VMS for the study of electronic, optical, vibrational, vibronic, and EPR properties, here the simulation of NMR spectra is presented with a particular emphasis on those techniques usually employed to investigate solid state systems. The SoSNMR module benefits from its ability to work under both periodic and nonperiodic conditions, such that small molecules/molecular clusters can be treated, as well as extended three-dimensional systems enforcing (or not) translational periodicity. These features allow VMS to simulate spectra resulting from NMR calculations by some popular quantum chemistry codes, namely Gaussian09/16, Castep, and Quantum Espresso. The effectiveness of the SoSNMR module of VMS is examined throughout the manuscript, and applied to simulate 1D static, MAS, and VAS NMR spectra as well as 2D correlation (90\u00b0, MAS) and MQMAS spectra of active NMR nuclei embedded in different amorphous and crystalline systems of actual interest in chemistry and material science.

Initially, solubility tests were carried out for four solvents such as water, water and methanol, water and ethanol, and water and acetone. Among the four solvents, the solubility of LAA was found to be the highest in water, so crystallization of LAA was done from its aqueous solution. Morphological analysis reveals that the crystal is a polyhedron with 16 developed faces with major face forms {100}, {001}, and {102} (pinacoids) parallel to the polar axis. As grown crystals were characterized by chemical analysis, density measurement, and X-ray powder diffraction studies.

Spraying a mixture of urushiol and iron(II) acetate formed a uniform coating about 10 nm thick, as confirmed by AFM observations. XPS measurements revealed that various substrates, including polyolefins and thermosetting resins, were successfully coated with urushiol. The coating showed good solvent tolerance and coating adhesion after baking at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min or after aerobic oxidation for several days. Interestingly, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements and strain-induced elastic buckling instability for mechanical measurements (SIEBIMM) revealed that density and Young\u2019s modulus of the spray-assisted nanocoatings were higher than those of spray-coated samples. Moreover, the coating was uninvolved in physical properties except surface properties, as demonstrated by several experiments.

We quantum mechanically calculated the stable delithiated configurations, the delithiation energy, the charge flow during delithiation, and the stability of the delithiated materials. We find that Li atoms are easier to extract from tetrahedral sites than octahedral ones. We calculate a large average voltage of 4.04 eV vs Li/Li+ for delithiation of the first Li atom in a primitive cell, which is confirmed by galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling data. Energy calculations indicate that topotactic delithiation is kinetically favored over decomposition into Li, ZrO2, and O2 during the charging process, although the thermodynamic energy of the topotactic reaction is less favorable. When one or two lithium atoms are extracted from a primitive cell of LZO, its volume and structure change little, whereas extraction of the third lithium greatly distorts the layered structure. The Li6ZrO6 and Li5ZrO6 delithiation products can be thermodynamically metastable to release of O2. Experimentally, materials with sufficiently small particle size for efficient delithiation and relithiation were achieved within an yttrium-doped LZO/carbon composite cathode that exhibited an initial discharge capacity of at least 200 mAh/g over the first 10 cycles, with 142 mAh/g maintained after 60 cycles. Computations predict that during the charging process, the oxygen ion near the Li vacancy is oxidized for both pure LZO and yttrium-doped LZO, which leads to a small-polaron hole.", "Rechargeable Mg batteries are promising candidates for high energy density storage in theory, when a Mg metal anode is combined with an oxide cathode material. Despite the widely observed sluggish Mg2+ diffusion in most oxide lattices, recent first-principles calculations predicted low diffusion barriers in the calcium ferrite (CF)-type post-spinel structures. In the present work, we experimentally examine the prospect of CF-type NaV1.25Ti0.75O4 as a Mg cathode. The Na+ ions, which lie in the ion migration pathway, need to be removed or exchanged with Mg2+ to allow Mg2+ de/intercalation. Partial desodiation was achieved through chemical and electrochemical methods, as proven by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, but deep desodiation was accompanied by partial amorphization of the material. Mg2+ ion exchange at moderate temperature (80 \u00b0C) resulted in the formation of Na0.19Mg0.41V1.25Ti0.75O4; however, phase transformation was observed when higher temperatures were applied to attempt complete ion exchange. Such phenomena point to the instability of the CF lattice when the tunnel is empty or occupied by a small ion (Mg2+). Thus, while the low migration barrier predicted by computation is partly based on the relative metastability of the theoretical CF-MgxV1.25Ti0.75O4 lattice, the difficulty in stabilizing it also renders the material synthetically nonaccessible, hindering this post-spinel\u2019s application as an electrode material.", "Currently, many types of affinity materials have been developed for the enrichment of glycoproteins potentially considered to be clinical biomarkers; however, they can not effectively distinguish between different glycoproteins and thus lack the functionality that may be the key to the diagnosis of specific diseases.

The resultant 2D material was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and electroosmotic flow analysis to demonstrate successful modification at each step. The performance of this 2D material was evaluated by capillary electrochromatography and allowed the successful online concentration and separation of five standard glycoproteins.

Experimentally, for methyl 1-pyrrolecarboxylate (M1PC), methyl 2-pyrrolecarboxylate (M2PC), and ethyl 2-pyrrolecarboxylate (E2PC), these values were derived from the standard (po = 0.1 MPa) molar enthalpies of formation, in the condensed phase, \u0394fHmo (cr,l), at T = 298.15 K, obtained by static bomb combustion calorimetry, and from the standard molar enthalpies of phase transition, \u0394cr,lgHmo, at T = 298.15 K, determined by high-temperature Calvet microcalorimetry. Standard ab initio molecular calculations, at the G3(MP2)//B3LYP level, were performed, and the standard enthalpies of formation of these three compounds were estimated.

Then, during a very short time span, the picture changed drastically with the advent of a number of processes for the production of a new raw material, wood pulp. The first of these was the so-called groundwood process, a mechanical process which was invented in 1844 but introduced to the U.S. in 1867. This development rapidly increased the production of newsprint, as indicated by the fact that the price dropped from 14\u00a2 to 2\u00a2/lb in less than 25 years.

Although the Ala294Gly/Thr251Gly mutant PheRS (PheRS**) under the control of T5 promoter allows incorporation of some Phe analogues into a protein, the T5 system is not suitable for material science studies because the amount of materials produced is not sufficient due to the moderate strength of the T5 promoter. This limitation can be overcome by using a pair of T7 promoter and T7 RNA polymerase instead. In the T7 expression system, it is difficult, however, to achieve a high incorporation level of Phe analogues, due to competition of Phe analogues for incorporation with the residual Phe that is required for synthesis of active T7 RNA polymerase. In this study, we prepared the PheRS** under T7 promoter and optimized culture condition to improve both the incorporation level of recombinant aECM protein and the incorporation level of Phe analogues. Incorporation and expression levels tend to increase in the case of p-azidophenylalanine, p-iodophenylalanine, and p-acetylphenylalanine. We evaluated the lower critical transition temperature, which is dependent on the incorporation ratio and the turbidity decreased when the incorporation level increased. Circular dichromism measurement indicated that this tendency is based on conformational change from random coil to \u03b2-turn structure. We demonstrated that polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be conjugated at reaction site of Phe analogues incorporated. We also demonstrated that the increased hydrophilicity of elastin-like sequences in the aECM-CS5-ELF made by PEG conjugation could suppress nonspecific adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).", "", "", 0, "", "Aerosols generated from aqueous samples of readily obtainable humic material standards are often used as proxies for organic particulates found in the atmosphere in various investigations, such as consideration of radiative forcing effects.

Pentagonal SiC2 is investigated with density functional theory-based calculations to show that the buckled nanostructure is dynamically stable, and exhibits an indirect energy band gap and an enhanced electronic dispersion with respect to the all-carbon counterpart. Computed Born effective charges exhibit a significant anisotropy for C and Si atoms that deviates substantially from their static effective charges. We establish an accurate tunability of the vertical location of the p-p-\u03c3 and p-p-\u03c0 bands and show that under compressive biaxial strain the density of states decreases, and conversely for tensile biaxial strain.

Due to the thermal and mechanical properties mismatch between GaN and diamond, a natural concern arises in terms of its interfacial stability as currently there is no established method to evaluate the interfacial toughness in GaN-on-diamond material. Using three generations of \u201cGaN-on-Diamond\u201d materials with varying process parameters, a comprehensive study has been carried out to identify the most appropriate fracture mechanics-based methods for reliable evaluation of the interfacial toughness in this novel material system. Several techniques were assessed, and the results are cross-compared; these include an ex situ nanoindentation induced buckling method and two-step indentation approach together with several analytical models. Additionally, a microcantilever bending method was adopted to measure an upper bound for the interfacial fracture toughness. For the three generations of materials, the interfacial toughness, GIc, was determined to be 0.7, 0.9, and 0.6 J\u00b7m\u20132, respectively. Postmortem analysis of the micro- and nanostructure of fractured interfaces indicated that the systems with better heat spreading capability displayed smoother fracture surfaces, i.e., were more brittle due to the lack of active toughening mechanisms.

Despite the widely observed sluggish Mg2+ diffusion in most oxide lattices, recent first-principles calculations predicted low diffusion barriers in the calcium ferrite (CF)-type post-spinel structures. In the present work, we experimentally examine the prospect of CF-type NaV1.25Ti0.75O4 as a Mg cathode. The Na+ ions, which lie in the ion migration pathway, need to be removed or exchanged with Mg2+ to allow Mg2+ de/intercalation. Partial desodiation was achieved through chemical and electrochemical methods, as proven by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, but deep desodiation was accompanied by partial amorphization of the material. Mg2+ ion exchange at moderate temperature (80 \u00b0C) resulted in the formation of Na0.19Mg0.41V1.25Ti0.75O4; however, phase transformation was observed when higher temperatures were applied to attempt complete ion exchange. Such phenomena point to the instability of the CF lattice when the tunnel is empty or occupied by a small ion (Mg2+). Thus, while the low migration barrier predicted by computation is partly based on the relative metastability of the theoretical CF-MgxV1.25Ti0.75O4 lattice, the difficulty in stabilizing it also renders the material synthetically nonaccessible, hindering this post-spinel\u2019s application as an electrode material.", "On Jan. 5, the ACS Santa Clara Valley Section in California joined Intel Corp., the Santa Clara Alliance of Black School Educators, and the Healing Institute (a local African American advocacy group) to orchestrate the first Intel George Washington Carver Science Fair for African American students at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Silicon Valley.

The Fano resonance driven dips in the transmission, when nucleobases stack with graphene nanoribbon, are known to be useful for DNA sequencing. For graphene and hBN nanoribbons the transmission dips are distinct for each nucleobase, but with a larger band gap for the latter case. For silicene nanoribbon the dips due to different nucleobases are somehow less clear. The transmission of the MoS2 nanoribbon is unpromising for DNA sequencing as the dip in the transmission is not useful to identify any of the nucleobase. The dip positions in the transmission shift linearly with bias voltage. This shift depends on the nanoribbon used and the orientation of the DNA base. Hence, edge-modified hBN nanoribbons with a reduced band gap could be an alternative to graphene nanoribbon (GNR) for DNA sequencing and recognition of other adsorbents.", "This Account describes how stereochemical ideas focused on chirality have been directed widely across polymer science allowing experiments that could not be conducted on small molecules and leading to new insights and new kinds of materials.

Spraying a mixture of urushiol and iron(II) acetate formed a uniform coating about 10 nm thick, as confirmed by AFM observations. XPS measurements revealed that various substrates, including polyolefins and thermosetting resins, were successfully coated with urushiol. The coating showed good solvent tolerance and coating adhesion after baking at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min or after aerobic oxidation for several days. Interestingly, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements and strain-induced elastic buckling instability for mechanical measurements (SIEBIMM) revealed that density and Young\u2019s modulus of the spray-assisted nanocoatings were higher than those of spray-coated samples. Moreover, the coating was uninvolved in physical properties except surface properties, as demonstrated by several experiments.

The resultant 2D material was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and electroosmotic flow analysis to demonstrate successful modification at each step. The performance of this 2D material was evaluated by capillary electrochromatography and allowed the successful online concentration and separation of five standard glycoproteins. The high separation efficiency can be largely attributed to the good orthogonality of boronate-functionalized graphene monolith and poly(guanidinium ionic liquid) monolith.", "A new procedure for the preparation of high aspect ratio Au nanowires utilizing gold electroless reduction in the hexagonally ordered, thiol-modified nanosized channels of the SBA-15 material is reported.

It is shown that the dimensions and the assembly of the Au seeds are important parameters for the subsequent electroless reduction process. The [AuCl4]- ions complexed to the TOAB molecules assembled on the thiol-modified mesoporous surface of the SBA-15 material are suitable precursors for the subsequent gold electroless reduction.

Before the 1870's, most paper was made on a relatively small scale from an expensive and increasingly scarce raw material, cotton rags. Then, during a very short time span, the picture changed drastically with the advent of a number of processes for the production of a new raw material, wood pulp. The first of these was the so-called groundwood process, a mechanical process which was invented in 1844 but introduced to the U.S. in 1867. This development rapidly increased the production of newsprint, as indicated by the fact that the price dropped from 14\u00a2 to 2\u00a2/lb in less than 25 years. Nevertheless, it can be argued that the so-called chemical pulping processes had the greatest impetus in making the pulp and paper industry the giant it is today.", "Antarctic ozone hole: Still getting bigger\nThis year's Antarctic ozone hole covers the largest area observed since the dramatic annual depletion began in the early 1980s.

Pentagonal SiC2 is investigated with density functional theory-based calculations to show that the buckled nanostructure is dynamically stable, and exhibits an indirect energy band gap and an enhanced electronic dispersion with respect to the all-carbon counterpart. Computed Born effective charges exhibit a significant anisotropy for C and Si atoms that deviates substantially from their static effective charges. We establish an accurate tunability of the vertical location of the p-p-\u03c3 and p-p-\u03c0 bands and show that under compressive biaxial strain the density of states decreases, and conversely for tensile biaxial strain. This coupling between the tunability of strain-mediated density of states and semiconducting properties in a monolayered structure may allow for the development of applications in semiconducting stretchable electronics.", "A systematic approach was followed to develop a new hybrid organic\u2013inorganic composite material with intriguing electrical and fluorescence properties into one ultrathin film system. Providing facile and cost-effective synthesis, this method utilizes a double decomposition reaction to introduce electric and fluorescence as an intrinsic property into one ultrathin film system, through dihydrolipoic acid-coated core/shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. Scanning tunneling microscope was used to asses, at the microstructured level, electrical properties of the composite material. Thin film composite devices exhibit higher conductivity with the application of a lower electrical field and inversely show lower conductivity when applying higher electrical bias point. The prospect of this feature solely lies in band gap engineering inherent to the device structure and geometric properties. The merits of such a device, paired with the ease of chemical functionalization provided by the water-soluble quantum dots, make the obtained hybrid organic\u2013inorganic thin film composite material a viable candidate to be used as sensors, optolectronic devices, as well as pathogenic detectors.", "We study\u2014experimentally and theoretically\u2014the energetics, structural changes, and charge flows during the charging and discharging processes for a new high-capacity cathode material, Li8ZrO6 (LZO), which we study both pure and yttrium-doped. We quantum mechanically calculated the stable delithiated configurations, the delithiation energy, the charge flow during delithiation, and the stability of the delithiated materials. We find that Li atoms are easier to extract from tetrahedral sites than octahedral ones. We calculate a large average voltage of 4.04 eV vs Li/Li+ for delithiation of the first Li atom in a primitive cell, which is confirmed by galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling data. Energy calculations indicate that topotactic delithiation is kinetically favored over decomposition into Li, ZrO2, and O2 during the charging process, although the thermodynamic energy of the topotactic reaction is less favorable. When one or two lithium atoms are extracted from a primitive cell of LZO, its volume and structure change little, whereas extraction of the third lithium greatly distorts the layered structure. The Li6ZrO6 and Li5ZrO6 delithiation products can be thermodynamically metastable to release of O2. Experimentally, materials with sufficiently small particle size for efficient delithiation and relithiation were achieved within an yttrium-doped LZO/carbon composite cathode that exhibited an initial discharge capacity of at least 200 mAh/g over the first 10 cycles, with 142 mAh/g maintained after 60 cycles. Computations predict that during the charging process, the oxygen ion near the Li vacancy is oxidized for both pure LZO and yttrium-doped LZO, which leads to a small-polaron hole.", "An acrylate type monomer was prepared by the reaction of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate with 9-oxo-9H-thioxanthene-3-carboxylic acid 10,10-dioxide and was polymerized using AIBN as an initiator and N,N-dimethylformamide as a solvent to yield a polymer containing a thioxanthene unit (P-THEA).

The gas diffusion into a bubble near the peripheral edge of the hydrophobic material on the bubble surface balances that out of the bubble from the other part of the uncovered bubble surface. In the present model, gas diffusion in quiescent liquid is assumed and there is no liquid flow. The total changes of energy and entropy are both zero as it is a kind of equilibrium state. The main origin of the dynamic equilibrium state is the gradient of chemical potential of gas near the peripheral edge of the hydrophobic material. It is caused by the permanent attractive potential of a hydrophobic material to gas molecules dissolved in liquid water as there is permanent repulsion of a hydrophobic material against liquid water. Thus, the gas supply will not terminate. It is numerically shown that stable nanobubble could be present when the fraction of surface coverage by hydrophobic material is from about 0.5 to 1. The stable size of a nanobubble changes with the liquid temperature as well as the degree of gas saturation of water. In slightly degassed water, not only a nanobubble but also a microbubble could be stable in mass balance when the fraction of surface coverage for a microbubble is on the order of 10\u20134 or less. For hydrophilic materials, however, a bubble could not be stable unless the fraction of the surface coverage is exactly 1.

Both, the non-hydrogenated and hydrogenated ND particles were successfully coupled to the surface of micrometer-size organo-silica particles. A thin layer of nanodiamonds (NDs) decorating the surface of the organo-silica particles was visible on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) were used to characterize the NDs prior to coupling and to confirm attachment onto the organo-silica particles. Both, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and a chemical initiator were proved to be effective radical initiators for the ND\u2013silica coupling reaction, although for scale-up purposes the chemical initiation was more advantageous to produce the ND\u2013silica composite. Commercially available nanodiamond primary particles were also coupled to the surface of silica particles. The ND-containing silica particles were packed into chromatographic columns to study their initial feasibility as adsorbent material for liquid chromatography.

How to autonomously warn and repair the damage simultaneously is a promising yet challenging task, owing to the difficulty in integrating different functional elements for packaging and lack of suitable vehicles to carry a multirole trigger with high reactivity. Herein, inspired by human skin in the damage-healing process, we report a genuinely fully autonomous smart material that is capable of warning of and healing damage via simply incorporating dual microcapsules containing polyamine as a multirole trigger and epoxy monomer dyed with a pH indicator, respectively. Both microscopic \u201csubcutaneous\u201d damage and macroscopic surface damage can be warned of by a conspicuous red color, not only rapidly upon occurrence but also permanently after being repaired. Accompanied with the comprehensive warning, the smart material shows high healing performance upon dynamic impact damage with efficiency up to 100% without external interventions. This facile and ready strategy with fully autonomous warning and healing functions independent of the host matrix provides a new avenue to enhance the reliability and longevity of a wide variety of polymeric materials ranging from functional coatings to structural composites.", "The blending process as the first working procedure in lead\u2013zinc sintering processes (LZSP) is a key step to guarantee the quality of products in the lead\u2013zinc sintering production.

Based on these unique properties of PLCL, we have developed balloons that are now widely used in treating major medical problems [Biomaterials2016,105, 109\u2013116]. One of the most important considerations needed for balloons is to ensure that the material properties remain similar after undergoing ethylene oxide (EtO) or gamma (\u03b3-) sterilization treatments. From the biotechnological point of view, we focused on analyzing the vital molecular properties of the PLCL material after sterilization, such as changes in crystallinity, molecular weight distributions (Mw, Mn, and polydispersity index), and inherent viscosity (\u03b7). Analysis of the data reveals that EtO sterilization does not engender any change in crystallinity, melting temperature (Tm), molecular weights, and \u03b7 of the polymer. On the contrary, \u03b3-radiations induce chain scission and consequential decrease of \u223c33 and \u223c15% in molecular weights and \u03b7 values, respectively. Based on our observations, we recommend EtO sterilization instead of \u03b3-radiation for PLCL.

However, two Ti atoms added to Si fullerene tend to dimerize, thereby reducing the hydrogen-storage efficiency. This clustering tendency of the Ti atoms on the fullerene surface can be avoided by doping the fullerene with P atoms.

The proportioning optimization is implemented through qualitative and quantitative synthetic optimization for the primary proportioning, the zone optimization for the secondary proportioning, and the intelligent coordination between them. The practical running results demonstrate the validity of the proposed optimization strategies.", "Freeze-dried delignified cellulosic (DC) material supported biocatalyst is proposed as a suitable form of biocatalyst to be preserved. The alcoholic fermentation of glucose using freeze-dried immobilized cells is reported. Freeze-dried immobilized baker's yeast cells on DC material do not need any protective medium during freeze-drying. The effect of initial glucose concentration and temperature on the alcoholic fermentation kinetic parameters is reported in the present study. It was found that the freeze-dried immobilized cells ferment more quickly than free freeze-dried cells and have a lower fermentation rate as compared with wet immobilized cells. However, repeated batch fermentations showed freeze-dried immobilized cells to ferment at about the same fermentation rate as wet immobilized cells. The results indicate that the freeze-dried immobilized cells must be further studied to establish a process for the preservation of immobilized cells.\nKeywords: Delignified cellulosics; freeze-dried; alcoholic fermentation; immobilization", "From first-principles density functional electronic structure calculations, we show that Si60H60 forms a highly symmetric (meta)stable fullerene structure on which Ti atoms can be capped exohedrally in cationic form, enabling storage of hydrogen in the molecular state. Whereas the H atoms on a Si60H60 cage saturate the Si dangling bonds, the Ti+ ion sitting on the energetically favorable hexagonal face of the Si60H60 fullerene allows a maximum of four H2 molecules to be attached, with a binding energy intermediate between those of physisorption and chemisorption. However, two Ti atoms added to Si fullerene tend to dimerize, thereby reducing the hydrogen-storage efficiency. This clustering tendency of the Ti atoms on the fullerene surface can be avoided by doping the fullerene with P atoms. Our first-principles results show that Ti-decorated P10Si50H50 clusters can serve as a potential hydrogen-storage material, with a storage capacity of up to 5.23 wt % corresponding to full Ti coverage.", "The Twenty-First Century will pose many challenges for our students.

This work reports a carefully designed aqueous droplet light heating system along with a thorough mathematical procedure, which combined leads to a precise determination of internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency of a variety of nanomaterials. The internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency of MXene, more specifically Ti3C2, was measured to be 100%, indicating a perfect energy conversion. Furthermore, a self-floating MXene thin membrane was prepared by simple vacuum filtration and the membrane, in the presence of a rationally chosen heat barrier, produced a light-to-water-evaporation efficiency of 84% under one sun irradiation, which is among the state of art energy efficiency for similar photothermal evaporation system.

We recently reported the first known carrier protein-dependent pathway for terminal alkyne formation, and in silico analysis suggested that this mechanism could be widespread in bacteria. In this paper, we screened additional homologous gene cassettes presumed to be involved in alkyne biosynthesis using both in vitro biochemical study and an E. coli-polyketide synthase (PKS) reporting system for in vivo analysis. We discovered and characterized a new terminal alkyne biosynthetic pathway comprised of TtuA, -B, and -C from Teredinibacter turnerae T7901. While the acyl-CoA ligase homologue (TtuA) demonstrated promiscuity in the activation and loading of medium-chain fatty acids onto the carrier protein (TtuC), the desaturase homologue (TtuB) showed stringent substrate specificity toward C10 fatty acyl moieties. In addition, TtuB was demonstrated to be a bifunctional desaturase/acetylenase that efficiently catalyzed two sequential O2-dependent dehydrogenation reactions. A novel terminal-alkyne bearing polyketide was further produced upon coexpression of ttuABC and a PKS gene in E. coli. The discovery and characterization of TtuA, -B, and -C provides us with a new bifunctional desaturase/acetylenase for mechanistic and structural study and expands the scarce enzyme inventory for the biosynthesis of the alkyne functionality, which has important applications in synthetic and chemical biology.", "", "Fibers resulting from pulping of wood are negatively charged by nature. Both the cellulose and hemicelluloses contribute to the anionicity. The negative charge of cellulosic material can be reversed with the same reagent commonly used for the cationization of starch. In this study, a bleached Kraft pulp was cationized in systems with different water-miscible organic solvents. Replacing 90% of the water with isopropanol and particularly with tetrahydrofuran yielded higher degrees of substitution and increased reaction efficiency. The degree of substitution depends on the concentration of the cationization reagent in water; partially replacing water with tetrahydrofuran can simulate a higher concentration while maintaining supramolecular properties, such as crystallinity and polymer chain integrity.", "A kind of Ni\u2013MoS3 material with a prismlike hollow structure was prepared through three steps: the preparation of a nickel precursor, the preparation of a NiMoS4 hollow structure intermediate product, and the annealing treatment of NiMoS4. Then, the catalytic activity of this material in slurry-phase hydrogenation of heavy oil was evaluated. Characterization results indicated that under suitable preparation conditions, the prepared hollow material with a Mo content of 23.40 wt % and a Ni content of 7.08 wt % had a length of approximately 340 nm, a width of approximately 300 nm, and a shell wall thickness of approximately 10 to 20 nm. Moreover, in addition to Ni, Mo, and S, the surface of the material also contained O and C, and the Mo4+ on the surface of this hollow material accounted for 77.24 wt % of the surface Mo atoms, which indicated that more Mo4+ with higher hydrogenation activity may be stably present on the surface of this hollow material than Mo in other valence states. In the slurry-phase hydrogenation reaction of fluid catalytic cracking slurry, this prepared Ni\u2013MoS3 hollow material showed higher catalytic activity than the compound catalyst of molybdenum naphthenate and nickel naphthenate with similar metal composition, indicating that the hollow material can more effectively utilize the metal to create more active sites, thereby providing higher hydrogenation activity and coke inhibition.", "Letters to the Editor that appeared within the print issues of C&EN have been included in C&EN Archives to provide a comprehensive representation of each issue.", "A new thio-germanium sulfide Li2Ga2GeS6 has been synthesized for the first time and its structure was found to be isomorphous with AgGaGeS4, which is well-known as a promising infrared NLO material.

Bone Marrow Homing Peptide 1 (BMHP1) functional motif (PFSSTKT) was previously demonstrated to stimulate neural stem cell (NSC) viability and differentiation when linked to SAPs. We here describe a novel ensemble of SAPs, developed from the BMHP1 (BMHP1-SAPs), that spontaneously assemble into tabular fibers, twisted ribbons, tubes and hierarchical self-assembled sheets: organized structures in the nano- and microscale. Thirty-two sequences were designed and evaluated, including biotinylated and unbiotinylated sequences, as well as a hybrid peptide\u2212peptoid sequence. Via X-ray diffraction (XRD), CD, and FTIR experiments we demonstrated that all of the BMHP1-SAPs share similarly organized secondary structures, that is, \u03b2-sheets and \u03b2-turns, despite their heterogeneous nanostructure morphology, scaffold stiffness, and effect over NSC differentiation and survival. Notably, we demonstrated the self-healing propensity of most of the tested BMHP1-SAPs, enlarging the set of potential applications of these novel SAPs. In in vitro cell culture experiments, we showed that some of these 10-mer peptides foster adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation of human NSCs. RGD-functionalized and hybrid peptide-peptoid self-assembling sequences also opened the door to BMHP1-SAP functionalization with further bioactive motifs, essential to tailor new scaffolds for specific applications. In in vivo experiments we verified a negligible reaction of the host nervous tissue to the injected and assembled BMHP1-SAP.

Based on these unique properties of PLCL, we have developed balloons that are now widely used in treating major medical problems [Biomaterials2016,105, 109\u2013116]. One of the most important considerations needed for balloons is to ensure that the material properties remain similar after undergoing ethylene oxide (EtO) or gamma (\u03b3-) sterilization treatments. From the biotechnological point of view, we focused on analyzing the vital molecular properties of the PLCL material after sterilization, such as changes in crystallinity, molecular weight distributions (Mw, Mn, and polydispersity index), and inherent viscosity (\u03b7). Analysis of the data reveals that EtO sterilization does not engender any change in crystallinity, melting temperature (Tm), molecular weights, and \u03b7 of the polymer. On the contrary, \u03b3-radiations induce chain scission and consequential decrease of \u223c33 and \u223c15% in molecular weights and \u03b7 values, respectively. Based on our observations, we recommend EtO sterilization instead of \u03b3-radiation for PLCL.

We present an independent particles in a box approach, which leads to a thermodynamic description of internal occupation equilibria of the type ZXi-1 + ZXi+1 \u21c4 2ZXi, where Z denotes the framework of the material and X the particles that can interchange places. The independent particles in a box are defined by considering a crystal consisting of a finite number of unit cells or boxes each of which can be filled with a specific number of particles. All empty sites in a box have equal probability to be occupied, independent of the number of particles present, as long as sites are available. Each time a particle does fall in a box, the probability for a next one to hit this box is reduced by 1 divided by the number of sites available in an empty box. Hence, as soon as a box is filled, the probability for a particle to hit it becomes zero. The maximum number of particles in the system is equal to the maximum number of sites in a box multiplied by the number of boxes. This allows equilibrium constants and the decrease of entropy as a function of the equivalent fraction of exchanging species to be calculated. We show that the plot of the logarithm of the equilibrium constant versus the equivalent fraction of exchanging species is not linear and that the nonlinearity is caused by the decrease of entropy. On the basis of this observation, we suggest the independent particles in a box to be used as a reference for \u201cideal behavior\u201d and to serve as a reference for determining activity coefficients. The generalization of the theory leads to the independent particles in boxes with different sites.

We demonstrate that plasmonic biofoam is a versatile optically active platform that can be harnessed for numerous applications including (i) ultrasensitive chemical detection using surface-enhanced Raman scattering; (ii) highly efficient energy harvesting and steam generation through plasmonic photothermal heating; and (iii) optical control of enzymatic activity by triggered release of biomolecules encapsulated within the aerogel.

However, their cycle life remains insufficient for commercial applications. Developing transition-metal oxide anode materials with a long lifespan through a facile route has become an important issue.

The use of 3D printed structures increases the simplicity of integration of the following key components with a variable temperature SEOP probe: (i) in situ NMR circuit operating at 84 kHz (Larmor frequencies of 129Xe and 1H nuclear spins), (ii) <0.3 nm narrowed 200 W laser source, (iii) in situ high-resolution near-IR spectroscopy, (iv) thermoelectric temperature control, (v) retroreflection optics, and (vi) optomechanical alignment system. The rapid prototyping endowed by 3D printing dramatically reduces production time and expenses while allowing reproducibility and integration of \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d components and enables the concept of printing on demand. The utility of this SEOP setup is demonstrated here to obtain near-unity 129Xe polarization values in a 0.5 L optical pumping cell, including \u223c74 \u00b1 7% at 1000 Torr xenon partial pressure, a record value at such high Xe density.

Additionally, after the aging corrosion, we analyzed the mechanical properties, morphology, crystallinity, and chemical elemental composition of the PPS filter material, along with the components of flue gas in the precipitator. The results showed that oxidizing agents (O3, NO2, and SO3) can be produced in the process of corona discharge of the flue gas and that they accelerate the crystallization and the degradation of crystalline and amorphous regions of the PPS, leading to the degradation of PPS in the electrostatic\u2013bag precipitator. With the coexistence of NO2 and SO3, the degradation energy barrier of PPS was reduced, thus resulting in faster degradation.", "A unique type of inorganic\u2212organic hybrid semiconductor bulk material is capable of emitting direct white light.

This is partly due to the complexity of artworks and partly due to the lack of appropriate standard materials. With the recent advance of NIR imaging spectrometers, the interval 1000\u20132500 nm became available for exploration, enabling us to extract quantitative chemical information from artworks. In this contribution, the development of 2D NIR quantitative chemical maps of heritage objects is discussed along with presentation of the first quantitative image. Further case studies include semiquantitative mapping of plasticiser distribution in a plastic object and identification of historic plastic materials. In the NIR imaging studies discussed, sets of 256 spatially registered images were collected at different wavelengths in the NIR region of 1000\u20132500 nm. The data was analyzed as a spectral cube, both as a stack of wavelength-resolved images and as a series of spectra, one per each sample pixel, using multivariate analysis. This approach is only possible using well-characterized reference sample collections, as quantitative imaging applications need to be developed, thus enabling spatial maps of damaged and degraded areas to be visualized to a level of chemical detail previously not possible.

Although this scrap is collected and recycled, remelting this scrap requires approximately 2 MWh/t, but some of this material could instead be diverted for use in other applications without remelting. However, this diversion depends not just on the mass of the scrapped steel, but also on its material characteristics. To enhance our understanding of the potential for such scrap diversion, this paper presents a novel material flow analysis of flat steel produced in Europe in 2013. This analysis considers the flows of steel characterized not only by mass but, for the first time, also by grade, thickness and coating. The results show that thin gauge galvanized drawing steel is the most commonly demanded steel grade across the industry and most scrap of this grade is generated by the automotive industry. There are thus potential opportunities for preventing and diverting scrap of this grade.

However, while exhibiting excellent initial capacity, these materials also suffer from voltage fade, high impedance, and poor rate capability, particularly in the Mn-rich, high Li excess concentration regime. Though it is clear that the Li2MnO3 component contributes to the high capacity as well as the chemical and structural degradation of the material, the inherent ionic conductivity of the material has not been clarified. In this work, we investigate the delithiation mechanism, involving coherent Li migration from two layers by first-principles density functional theory. Surprisingly, and contrary to expectations from available experimental results, we find that the pristine material exhibits excellent Li mobility enabling facile Li extraction from both the transition metal layer and Li-layer. Generally, the Li-extractions are highly accelerated by di- and trivacancy clusters, which stabilize the saddle point tetrahedral sites. Hence, we deduce that the observed inferior rate behavior of this class of Li cathode materials is not due to intrinsic poor bulk ionic mobility, but more likely due to surface-passivation, structural deterioration, and/or particle\u2013particle electrode-level transport limitations.", "As a group of attractive photoelectromagnetic and catalytic functional materials, metal oxychlorides have been attracting attention for electrochemical energy storage in rechargeable chloride ion battery (CIB) systems recently.

The formation rate of the reaction intermediate Bi2SeO2 was the bottleneck in the SHS process of BiCuSeO. Importantly, we found that adding PbO in the starting materials has (i) facilitated the formation of Bi2SeO2 and thus significantly reduced the SHS reaction time; (ii) improved the phase purity and sample homogeneity; (iii) increased the power factor via increasing both carrier concentration and effective mass; and (iv) reduced the lattice thermal conductivity via more point defect phonon scattering.

The spheres were isolated and then used as hierarchical templates to prepare porous materials with well-defined architecture. Multimodal porous silica and bimodal macroporous gold electrodes were fabricated using the 1500/110 nm hierarchical template. Because the templates were constructed of only one material, polystyrene, they were easily removed from the host material to yield the macroporous material with pores of well-defined sizes that corresponded to the size of the template.

While tremendous progress has been made in the synthesis of size- and shape-controlled plasmonic nanostructures, their integration with other materials and application in solid-state is primarily through their assembly on rigid two-dimensional (2D) substrates, which limits the plasmonically active space to a few nanometers above the substrate. In this work, we demonstrate a simple method to create plasmonically active three-dimensional biofoams by integrating plasmonic nanostructures with highly porous biomaterial aerogels. We demonstrate that plasmonic biofoam is a versatile optically active platform that can be harnessed for numerous applications including (i) ultrasensitive chemical detection using surface-enhanced Raman scattering; (ii) highly efficient energy harvesting and steam generation through plasmonic photothermal heating; and (iii) optical control of enzymatic activity by triggered release of biomolecules encapsulated within the aerogel. Our results demonstrate that 3D plasmonic biofoam exhibits significantly higher sensing, photothermal, and loading efficiency compared to conventional 2D counterparts. The design principles and processing methodology of plasmonic aerogels demonstrated here can be broadly applied in the fabrication of other functional foams.", "A new organically templated noncentrosymmetric polar zinc chloride, [N(CH3)4]ZnCl3, has been synthesized hydrothermally, and the structure was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The reported material exhibits a unidimensional crystal structure consisting of chains of anionic ZnCl4 tetrahedra that are separated by [N(CH3)4]+ cations. Second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurement on the noncentrosymmetric [N(CH3)4]ZnCl3, using 1064 nm radiation, indicate the material has a SHG efficiency of approximately 15 \u00d7 \u03b1-SiO2. Additional SHG measurements indicate the material is nonphase-matchable (type 1). In addition, converse piezoelectric measurements revealed d33 values of 10 pm/V. Thermogravimetric analysis, UV\u2212vis diffuse reflectance, and infrared spectroscopy were also performed, as were electronic structure calculations.

In this process, CSA-ANI micelles act as soft template facilatating the formation of PANI nanowire. PANI-CSA-Ni nanowire composite was characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The use of PANI-CSA-Ni composite nanowire as sensing material was also investigated. It was observed that PANI-CSA-Ni nanowire composite shows nearly four order decrease in ac impedance in the presence of cigarette smoke. Therefore, such material has potential for use in cigarette smoke detector. Impedance response in the presence of controls like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide was also measured. It was observed that whereas carbon dioxide gas has a negligible role in the change in ac impedance, there was a half-order change in impedance response in the presence of carbon monoxide (CO), hinting the possibility of CO as one of the contributing constituents of observed impedance response in cigarette smoke. However, no signature for the formation of Ni(CO)4 was identified from FTIR spectrum. We believe that derivatives of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and alkaloid like nicotine present in cigarette smoke form a charge transfer complex with Ni as the binding site on the polymer nanowire as a result, the mobile charge carrier increases in the system thus decreasing the ac impedance.", "The double perovskite CaMnTi2O6, is a rare A-site ordered perovskite oxide that exhibits a sizable ferroelectric polarization and relatively high Curie temperature. Using first-principles calculations combined with detailed symmetry analyses, we identify the origin of the ferroelectricity in CaMnTi2O6. We further explore the material properties of CaMnTi2O6, including its ferroelectric polarization, dielectric and piezoelectric responses, magnetic order, electronic structure, and optical absorption coefficient. It is found that CaMnTi2O6 exhibits room-temperature-stable ferroelectricity and moderate piezoelectric responses. Moreover, CaMnTi2O6 is predicted to have a semiconducting energy band gap similar to that of BiFeO3, and its band gap can further be tuned via distortions of the planar Mn\u2013O bond lengths. CaMnTi2O6 exemplifies a new class of single-phase semiconducting ferroelectric perovskites for potential applications in ferroelectric photovoltaic solar cells.", "Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit many exciting phenomena that make them promising as materials for future electronic, optoelectronic, and mechanical devices. Because of their atomic thinness, interfaces play a dominant role in determining material behavior. In order to observe and exploit the unique properties of these materials, it is therefore vital to obtain clean and repeatable interfaces. However, the conventional mechanical stacking of atomically thin layers typically leads to trapped contaminants and spatially inhomogeneous interfaces, which obscure the true intrinsic behavior. This work presents a simple and generic approach to create clean 2D material interfaces in mechanically stacked structures. The operating principle is to use an AFM tip to controllably squeeze contaminants out from between 2D layers and their substrates, similar to a \u201csqueegee\u201d. This approach leads to drastically improved homogeneity and consistency of 2D material interfaces, as demonstrated by AFM topography and significant reduction of photoluminescence line widths. Also, this approach enables emission from interlayer excitons, demonstrating that the technique enhances interlayer coupling in van der Waals heterostructures. The technique enables repeatable observation of intrinsic 2D material properties, which is crucial for the continued development of these promising materials.", "The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) announced on April 22 that it will award $60 million over four years to liberal arts colleges to revitalize science teaching.

However, before reaching the maximum of the figure of merit (ZT), Cu2S undergoes three phase transformations starting at 370 K, which give rise to severe problems, such as possible decomposition and low reliability. Herein, we discover CsCu5S3 with phase transformation at 823 K, which is significantly higher than the 370 K value of Cu2S. Single crystal diffraction data reveal that its two phases are constructed by the same Cu4S4 columnar building unit via propagating either at the opposite sides into a layered o-CsCu5S3, or at the four apexes into a 3D t-CsCu5S3, respectively. Interestingly, the o-to-t transformation is quick, but the reverse one is relatively slow. Theoretical studies reveal that the Cu4S4 column exhibits not only the most condensed atomic aggregation (Dcolumn) but also the lightest effective mass (m*), along which higher \u03c3 is realized. More interestingly, both phases exhibit remarkable ZT enhancements, 0.46 at 800 K for o-CsCu5S3, and 0.56 at 875 K for t-CsCu5S3, which are 170% and 175% that of Cu2S at the same temperature.", "How Viagra works, structurally\nAnti-impotence drugs like sildenafil (Viagra, shown) work by binding with an enzyme known as PDE5, a member of the enzyme superfamily of phosphodiesterases.

Various synthetic methods have been employed in the preparation of PPEs such as polycondensation, polyaddition, ring-opening polymerization, and olefin metathesis polymerization.

The amphiphilic prodrug could self-assemble into micelles in aqueous solution. The average particle size and morphology of the prodrug micelles were measured by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The results of size change under different conditions indicate that the micelles possess a favorable stability in physiological conditions and can be degraded in reductive medium. Moreover, the studies of in vitro drug release behavior confirm the reduction-responsive degradation of the prodrug micelles. A methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay verifies the good biocompatibility of P(EAEP-PPA) not only for normal cells, but also for tumor cells.

A better understanding of the physical characteristics of the filler\u2013rubber interface and the filler\u2013rubber interphase as well is necessary to improve the overall macroscopic properties of these elastomeric nanocomposites. Therefore, the surface energies and polarities of filler particles with different modified surfaces were measured by a modified Wilhelmy technique. In all cases the rubber matrix consisted of a solution - styrene butadiene copolymers, filled with 20 or 40 phr pyrogenic or precipitated silica grades with different surface modifications by silanes, and a carbon black sample as reference. A moving die rheometer was employed to observe the filler flocculation at elevated temperatures (160 \u00b0C) in rubber mixtures containing no curatives. A significant influence of the surface energy of the filler was noticed: the flocculation tendency increased with increasing difference in work of adhesion between filler and rubber. In dynamic mechanical measurements the influence of the filler/filler and the filler/polymer interactions were studied in cured S-SBR samples. Amplitude sweep experiments were carried out to investigate the temperature dependent nonlinear characteristics of the elastic and viscous moduli, which is commonly associated with a progressive breakdown of the filler network at higher strain amplitudes (Payne effect). Static measurements and relaxations test were accomplished by large scale strain experiments. A structural\u2013phenomenological modeling of the long strain mechanical properties of these rubber compounds was done: the \u201clayered fiber model\u201d. This new model is based on the hypothesis that during deformation of the composites the polymer chains slipped off from the polymer interphase around the filler particles into the gaps between aggregates, where high-strength polymer fibers in an uniaxially oriented state are formed. We find new interesting correlations between the physicochemical properties of the filler/polymer interface and the macroscopic mechanical properties of the elastomeric materials.", "Poly-[(R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate] biopolymers, or PHAs, are biocompatible and biodegradable polyesters that can be produced by diverse microbial strains. PHA polymers have found widespread uses in applications ranging from sustainable replacements of nonbiodegradable bulk-commodity plastics to biomaterials. However, further expansion into other markets and industries has generally been limited by the inability to chemically modify these polymers. Recently, our lab engineered E. coli LSBJ, a microbial strain able to produce PHA copolymers with controlled unit compositions from simple and accessible fatty acid feedstocks. We envisioned meaningfully broadening the application spectrum of these materials via production of chemically tractable PHA biopolymers containing \u201cclick\u201d-ready chemical functionalities.

For studying three-dimensional (3D) structure models and related chemical information, we focused on using a commodity VR device (VIVE) and an authoring tool (Unity). To visualize 3D chemical structures, disturbances like judder due to dropped frames should be eliminated from the VR experience to improve simulations. We propose a simple evaluation method that is straightforward for the nonexpert or novice VR user. We examine the major visualization representations including ball, ball and stick, and isosurface systems. For systematic benchmark measurements, a pendulum from the VR device was used to generate periodic oscillatory motion during measurements of a time series in frames per second (fps). For VIVE with a refresh rate of 90 Hz, judder occurred when less than 90 fps. We demonstrated the system size limitations for the results of molecular dynamics simulations of phase separation of ABA block copolymers and experimental observations of filler morphologies in rubber.", "Artificial photosynthetic (AP) approaches to convert and store solar energy will require membranes capable of conducting both ions and electrons while remaining relatively transparent and chemically stable. A new approach is applied herein involving previously described in situ chemical polymerization of electronically conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) in the presence of proton conducting heteropoly acid (HPA) phosphomolybdic acid (PMA). The electrochemical behaviour of the PEDOT/PMA hybrid material was investigated and it was found that the conducting polymer (CP) is susceptible to irreversible oxidative processes at potentials where water is oxidized. This will be problematic in AP devices should the process occur in very close proximity to a conducting polymer-based membrane. It was found that PEDOT grants the system good electrical performance in terms of conductivity and stability over a large pH window; however, the presence of PMA was not found to provide sufficient proton conductivity. This was addressed in an additional study by tuning the ionic (and in turn, electronic) conductivity in creating composites with the proton-permselective polymer Nafion. It was found that a material of this nature with near-equal conductivity for optimal chemical conversion efficiency will consist of roughly three parts Nafion and one part PEDOT/PMA.", "Controlling the interface between bacteria and solid materials has become an important task in biomedical science. For a fundamental and comprehensive understanding of adhesion it is necessary to seek quantitative information about the involved interactions. Most studies concentrate on the modification of the surface (chemical composition, hydrophobicity, or topography) neglecting, however, the influence of the bulk material, which always contributes to the overall interaction via van der Waals forces. In this study, we applied AFM force spectroscopy and flow chamber experiments to probe the adhesion of Staphylococcus carnosus to a set of tailored Si wafers, allowing for a separation of short- and long-range forces. We provide experimental evidence that the subsurface composition of a substrate influences bacterial adhesion. A coarse estimation of the strength of the van der Waals forces via the involved Hamaker constants substantiates the experimental results. The results demonstrate that the uppermost layer is not solely responsible for the strength of adhesion. Rather, for all kinds of adhesion studies, it is equally important to consider the contribution of the subsurface.", "General routes to confined spaces of well-defined chemical composition and complex three-dimensional structure have long been sought by materials chemists. Here, we introduce metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) materials as an ideal scaffold upon which such organized complexity can be built. Employing an orthogonal coordination strategy, we constructed a large-pore MOF material with two different modifiable linkers in well-defined positions relative to each other. The independent and quantitative covalent grafting of two distinct chemical groups onto these differently reactive linkers yielded a uniformly bifunctionalized MOF material. Not only does this methodology offer an efficient route via which the properties of well-defined microporous materials can be fine-tuned, but it also creates a solid-state platform for synthetically accessing constructs that better emulate the well-ordered intricacy of biological structures.", "Fullerenes are increasingly being used in medical, environmental, and electronic applications due to their unique structural and electronic properties. However, the energy and environmental impacts associated with their commercial-scale production have not yet been fully investigated. In this work, the life cycle embodied energy of C60 and C70 fullerenes has been quantified from cradle-to-gate, including the relative contributions from synthesis, separation, purification, and functionalization processes, representing a more comprehensive scope than used in previous fullerene life cycle studies. Comparison of two prevalent production methods (plasma and pyrolysis) has shown that pyrolysis of 1,4-tetrahydronaphthalene emerges as the method with the lowest embodied energy (12.7 GJ/kg of C60). In comparison, plasma methods require a large amount of electricity, resulting in a factor of 7\u221210\u00d7 higher embodied energy in the fullerene product. In many practical applications, fullerenes are required at a purity >98% by weight, which necessitates multiple purification steps and increases embodied energy by at least a factor of 5, depending on the desired purity. For applications such as organic solar cells, the purified fullerenes need to be chemically modified to [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), thus increasing the embodied energy to 64.7 GJ/kg C60-PCBM for the specified pyrolysis, purification, and functionalization conditions. Such synthesis and processing effects are even more significant for the embodied energy of larger fullerenes, such as C70, which are produced in smaller quantities and are more difficult to purify. Overall, the inventory analysis shows that the embodied energy of all fullerenes are an order of magnitude higher than most bulk chemicals, and, therefore, traditional cutoff rules by weight during life cycle assessment of fullerene-based products should be avoided.", "We report a template-free facile technique that allows for the first ever synthesis of a monoclinic Ag2Mo2O7 nanowire (m-Ag2Mo2O7-NW), using a commercially available MoO3 particle. The nanowire possessed high crystallinity and structural homogeneity and strongly suggested that the nanowire was grown through an oriented aggregation mechanism in contrast to the case of a typical solution-phase method. The corresponding bulky counterpart showed no photoresponse; however, a complete structural transformation toward a nanowire triggered activity for O2 evolution in the presence of Ag+ as an electron acceptor under visible-light irradiation.", "The stability and reactivity of planar starlike C6Li6 and its hydrogen-adsorbed analogue were analyzed using density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. The ability of the C6Li6 system to trap and liberate hydrogen in its molecular form at different temperatures has been established. Interestingly, the planarity of C6Li6 is mostly conserved even at high temperature, making this molecule a good candidate to serve as a hydrogen-storage material.", "A new family of composite materials as anode for lithium-ion batteries, MO-SnxCoyCz (x:y:z molar ratio), was synthesized by custom-made ultrahigh energy ball milling (UHEM) and conventional SPEX ball milling methods. In the past, alloys such as SnCoC and metal oxides such as SiO, SnO2, MoO3, etc., have been studied extensively because of their long cycle life and/or high capacity. The composite metal oxide-SnCoC combines both of these advantages. In this work, we took 50 wt % SiO\u201350 wt % Sn30Co30C40 as an example, and found that ultrahigh energy ball mill offers more nanoparticles and higher capacity compared with conventional milling. High-energy X-ray diffraction indicates the presence of CoSn2 and Co Bragg phases and highly distorted phases in the mixture. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis reveals a tremendous difference between UHEM and SPEX samples. The pair distribution function shows the local structure and indicates that SiO and SnCoC are not only a physical mixture, but have reacted chemically. Full-cell testing established the feasibility of the composite as an anode material for high-energy, long-life Li-ion batteries. These results demonstrate that the nanostructured SiO\u2013Sn30Co30C40 composite is a promising anode material for practical applications.", "A novel artificial muscle material based on an acrylic acid/acrylamide hydrogel blended with a conductive polypyrrole/carbon black composite was prepared. The material was optimized in terms of its electroactuation response by varying the acrylic acid content, the blending concentration of the conductive composite, and the intensity of the electric field. The artificial muscle material showed a fast and reversible electroactuation when a low potential was applied. Further, the artificial muscle was incorporated into a microfabricated pumping device that exhibited reproducible flow rates, thus demonstrating its potential usefulness in bio-micro-electro\u2212mechanical systems (BioMEMS) applications.", "The metal\u2013organic host material [{CoIII2(bpbp)(O2)}2bdc](PF6)4 (1\u00b72O2; bpbp\u2013 = 2,6-bis(N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)aminomethyl)-4-tert-butylphenolato; bdc2\u2013 = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylato) displays reversible chemisorptive desorption and resorption of dioxygen through conversion to the deoxygenated Co(II) form [{CoII2(bpbp)}2bdc](PF6)4 (1). Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the host lattice 1\u00b72O2, achieved through desorption of included water guests from the as-synthesized phase 1\u00b72O2\u00b73H2O, consists of an ionic lattice containing discrete tetranuclear complexes, between which lie void regions that allow the migration of dioxygen and other guests. Powder X-ray diffraction analyses indicate that the host material retains crystallinity through the dioxygen desorption/chemisorption processes. Dioxygen chemisorption measurements on 1 show near-stoichiometric uptake of dioxygen at 5 mbar and 25 \u00b0C, and this capacity is largely retained at temperatures above 100 \u00b0C. Gas adsorption isotherms of major atmospheric gases on both 1 and 1\u00b72O2 indicate the potential suitability of this material for air separation, with a O2/N2 selectivity factor of 38 at 1 atm. Comparison of oxygen binding in solution and in the solid state indicates a dramatic increase in binding affinity to the complex when it is incorporated in a porous solid.", 0, 0, "Shells of oyster species belonging to the genus Crassostrea have similar shell microstructural features comprising well-ordered calcite folia. However, the mechanical strengths of folia differ dramatically between closely related species. For example, the calcareous shells of the Hong Kong oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis are stronger than those of its closest relative, the Portuguese oyster, Crassostrea angulata. Specifically, after removal of organic content, the folia of C. hongkongensis are 200% tougher and able to withstand a 100% higher crushing force than that of C. angulata. Detailed analyses of shell structural and mechanical features support the hypothesis that crystallographic interdigitations confer elevated mechanical strength in C. hongkongensis oyster shells compared to C. angulata shells. Consequently, the folia of C. hongkongensis are structurally equipped to withstand a higher external load compared to C. angulata. The observed relationships between oyster shell structure, crystallography, and mechanical properties provided an insightful context in which to consider the likely fate of these two species in future climate change scenarios. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary approach developed in this study through integrating electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data into finite element analysis (FEA) could be applied to other biomineral systems to investigate the relationship between crystallography and mechanical behavior.", "Invented by Charles Goodyear, chemical cross-linking of rubbers by sulfur vulcanization is the only method by which modern automobile tires are manufactured. The formation of these cross-linked network structures leads to highly elastic properties, which substantially reduces the viscous properties of these materials. Here, we describe a simple approach to converting commercially available and widely used bromobutyl rubber (BIIR) into a highly elastic material with extraordinary self-healing properties without using conventional cross-linking or vulcanising agents. Transformation of the bromine functionalities of BIIR into ionic imidazolium bromide groups results in the formation of reversible ionic associates that exhibit physical cross-linking ability. The reversibility of the ionic association facilitates the healing processes by temperature- or stress-induced rearrangements, thereby enabling a fully cut sample to retain its original properties after application of the self-healing process. Other mechanical properties, such as the elastic modulus, tensile strength, ductility, and hysteresis loss, were found to be superior to those of conventionally sulfur-cured BIIR. This simple and easy approach to preparing a commercial rubber with self-healing properties offers unique development opportunities in the field of highly engineered materials, such as tires, for which safety, performance, and longer fatigue life are crucial factors.", "Conspectus\nGrowing concern over water scarcity leads to increased research interest in advanced water purification technologies. Solar water purification, which uses solar energy to separate water and impurities through vaporization, enables the utilization of sustainable energy and potential freshwater resources to alleviate water scarcity. However, the essential process of solar water evaporation to remove impurities is energy intensive. Insufficient solar absorption and thermal loss limited the vapor generation rate and, thus, lowered the purified water yield. Diffuse natural sunlight cannot satisfy the intrinsic energy demand for rapid water vaporization. Therefore, developing new material platforms that can simultaneously provide high solar absorption, effective energy utilization, and low energy demand for water vaporization to achieve highly efficient solar water purification under natural sunlight is anticipated.\nIn this Account, we review our recent progress on hydrogel-based evaporators for solar water purification in terms of material selection, molecular engineering, and structural design. First, we introduce the unique water state in hydrogels consisting of free, intermediate, and bound water, of which intermediate water has a reduced energy demand for water evaporation. Then, we describe the design principles of hydrogel-based solar evaporators, where the polymeric networks are tailored to regulate the water state. The water state in hydrogels defines the vaporization behavior of water. Thus, the polymer networks of hydrogels can be architected to tune the water state and, hence, to further reduce the evaporation enthalpy of water. Armed with fundamental gelation chemistry, we discuss synthetic strategies of hydrogels for efficient vapor generation. By incorporating solar absorbers with hydrophilic polymer networks, solar energy is harvested and converted to heat energy, which can be in situ utilized to power the vaporization of contained water in the molecular meshes, and the solar absorbers having strong interaction with hydrogels guide the formation of microstructure to reduce the energy loss and ensure adequate water transport of evaporative water. Regulating the vaporizing fronts, engineering the surface of hydrogels has been focused to favor the evaporationof water to further enhance the solar-to-vapor efficiency. By using hydrophilic polymers as building blocks, the hydrogel-based solar evaporators have also been endowed with multiple functionalities, such as antifouling, permselectivity, and thermal responsiveness, to improve water collection and purification abilities. Taking advantages of these merits, hydrogels have emerged as a promising materials platform to enable efficient solar water purification under natural sunlight. This Account serves to promote future efforts toward practical purification systems using hydrogel-based solar evaporators to mitigate water scarcity by improving their performance, scalability, stability, and sustainability.", "Self-assembling peptides (SAPs) are rapidly gaining interest as bioinspired scaffolds for cell culture and regenerative medicine applications. Bone Marrow Homing Peptide 1 (BMHP1) functional motif (PFSSTKT) was previously demonstrated to stimulate neural stem cell (NSC) viability and differentiation when linked to SAPs. We here describe a novel ensemble of SAPs, developed from the BMHP1 (BMHP1-SAPs), that spontaneously assemble into tabular fibers, twisted ribbons, tubes and hierarchical self-assembled sheets: organized structures in the nano- and microscale. Thirty-two sequences were designed and evaluated, including biotinylated and unbiotinylated sequences, as well as a hybrid peptide\u2212peptoid sequence. Via X-ray diffraction (XRD), CD, and FTIR experiments we demonstrated that all of the BMHP1-SAPs share similarly organized secondary structures, that is, \u03b2-sheets and \u03b2-turns, despite their heterogeneous nanostructure morphology, scaffold stiffness, and effect over NSC differentiation and survival. Notably, we demonstrated the self-healing propensity of most of the tested BMHP1-SAPs, enlarging the set of potential applications of these novel SAPs. In in vitro cell culture experiments, we showed that some of these 10-mer peptides foster adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation of human NSCs. RGD-functionalized and hybrid peptide-peptoid self-assembling sequences also opened the door to BMHP1-SAP functionalization with further bioactive motifs, essential to tailor new scaffolds for specific applications. In in vivo experiments we verified a negligible reaction of the host nervous tissue to the injected and assembled BMHP1-SAP. This work will pave the way to the development of novel SAP sequences that may be useful for material science and regenerative medicine applications.", "Three-dimensional printing with high-temperature plastic is used to enable spin exchange optical pumping (SEOP) and hyperpolarization of xenon-129 gas. The use of 3D printed structures increases the simplicity of integration of the following key components with a variable temperature SEOP probe: (i) in situ NMR circuit operating at 84 kHz (Larmor frequencies of 129Xe and 1H nuclear spins), (ii) <0.3 nm narrowed 200 W laser source, (iii) in situ high-resolution near-IR spectroscopy, (iv) thermoelectric temperature control, (v) retroreflection optics, and (vi) optomechanical alignment system. The rapid prototyping endowed by 3D printing dramatically reduces production time and expenses while allowing reproducibility and integration of \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d components and enables the concept of printing on demand. The utility of this SEOP setup is demonstrated here to obtain near-unity 129Xe polarization values in a 0.5 L optical pumping cell, including \u223c74 \u00b1 7% at 1000 Torr xenon partial pressure, a record value at such high Xe density. Values for the 129Xe polarization exponential build-up rate [(3.63 \u00b1 0.15) \u00d7 10\u20132 min\u20131] and in-cell 129Xe spin\u2013lattice relaxation time (T1 = 2.19 \u00b1 0.06 h) for 1000 Torr Xe were in excellent agreement with the ratio of the gas-phase polarizations for 129Xe and Rb (PRb \u223c 96%). Hyperpolarization-enhanced 129Xe gas imaging was demonstrated with a spherical phantom following automated gas transfer from the polarizer. Taken together, these results support the development of a wide range of chemical, biochemical, material science, and biomedical applications.", "Daily repeated wound dressing changes will lead to additional trauma to newly formed tissue and prolonging the healing process. In this letter, we designed and fabricated an easily removable wound dressing material. To accomplish this, we first generated cross-linkable supramonomers through host\u2013guest noncovalent interaction, followed by radical copolymerization of acrylamide with supramonomer as cross-linker to fabricate supramolecular hydrogels. Benefiting from the dynamic nature of the supramonomer, the supramolecular hydrogel is able to dissolve upon exposure to memantine, an FDA approved drug, making it easily removed from a wound, representing a promising candidate for the new generation of wound dressing.", "We present here the application of the energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) in the tomographic mode to determine the precise 3D distribution of nitrogen within nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs). Several tilt series of energy-filtered images were acquired on the K ionization edges of carbon and nitrogen on a multiwalled N-CNT containing a high amount of nitrogen. Two tilt series of carbon and nitrogen 2D maps were then calculated from the corresponding energy-filtered images by using a proper extraction procedure of the chemical signals. Applying iterative reconstruction algorithms provided two spatially correlated C and N elemental-selective volumes, which were then simultaneously analyzed with the shape-sensitive reconstruction deduced from Zero-Loss recordings. With respect to the previous findings, crucial information obtained by analyzing the 3D chemical maps was that, among the two different kind of arches formed in these nanotubes (transversal or rounded ones depending on their morphology), the transversal arches contain more nitrogen than do the round ones. In addition, a detailed analysis of the shape-sensitive volume allowed the observation of an unexpected change in morphology along the tube axis: close to the round arches (with less N), the tube is roughly cylindrical, whereas near the transversal ones (with more N), its shape changes to a prism. This relatively new technique is very powerful in the material science because it combines the ability of the classical electron tomography to solve 3D structures and the chemical selectivity of the EFTEM imaging.", "Nanoporous zeolite foam is an interesting crystalline material with an open-cell microcellular structure, similar to polyurethane foam (PUF). The aluminosilicate structure of this material has a large surface area, extended porosity, and mechanical strength. Owing to these properties, this material is suitable for industrial applications such as large-scale gas separation and catalysis. As the applications of this material are significant, the underlying concepts for the design and synthesis may be used in an upper-level undergraduate laboratory in inorganic synthesis or material chemistry courses. This type of experiment can increase student understanding and integrate a variety of chemical concepts, such as targeted synthesis, characterization, and adsorption theory of gases. This laboratory experiment involves the synthesis and characterization of ZSM-5 type of zeolite foam that is synthesized from inexpensive materials and characterized by bulk density and porous volume measurements. This course would acquaint students with general characterization methods that are not normally encountered in a typical material or inorganic chemistry laboratory.", "Responsive polymer gels that contain bilayer membranes have been synthesized and characterized as a novel hybrid material. The hybrid gels show some unique properties which cannot be obtained from the individual polymer gels and the bilayer membranes. Iridescent color resulting from the Bragg diffraction of visible light by the periodic structure of bilayer membranes can be changed by controlling the swelling degree of the gel. Introduction of bilayer membranes strongly affects the volume phase transition behavior of the gel. By the polymerization of a gel while shear flow is imposed upon the solution to be gelled, an anisotropic gel has been synthesized. The hybrid gels show more than a seven times larger elastic modulus and can be extended more than three times before fracture than the simple polymer gel.", "Cubic-framework sodium cobalt-based metaphosphate NaCo(PO3)3 was recently demonstrated to be an attractive Na+ cationic conductor. It can be potentially used in the next-generation rechargeable Na ion batteries. The crystal structure and electrical conductivity were studied and found to have a three-dimensional framework with interconnecting tunnels for Na+ migration ( J. Solid State Electrochem., 2016, 20, 1241). This inspired us to study the electrochemical (de)intercalation behavior of Na+ in the NaCo(PO3)3 assuming a cubic Pa3\u0305 framework. Herein, synergizing experimental and computational tools, we present the first report on the electrochemical activity and Na+ diffusion pathway analysis of cubic NaCo(PO3)3 prepared via conventional solid-state route. The electrochemical analyses reveal NaCo(PO3)3 to be an active sodium insertion material with well-defined reversible Co3+/Co2+ redox activity centered at 3.3 V (vs Na/Na+). Involving a solid-solution redox mechanism, close to 0.7 Na+ per formula unit can be reversibly extracted. This experimental finding is augmented with bond valence site energy (BVSE) modeling to clarify Na+ migration in cubic NaCo(PO3)3. BVSE analyses suggest feasible Na+ migration with moderate energy barrier of 0.68 eV. Cubic NaCo(PO3)3 forms a 3.3 V sodium insertion material.", "A previous study showed that elementary teaching majors enrolled in an inquiry-based physical science course developed chemistry content knowledge comparable to that of students enrolled in traditional lecture-based courses. This current study compares the views of these elementary teaching majors regarding how chemistry is taught and learned to the views of secondary science teaching majors enrolled in science-specific methods courses. The results show that the elementary teaching majors developed views of how science is taught and learned that were more in line with constructivist ideals than the secondary science teaching majors. In addition, the elementary teaching majors improved their interest and confidence in teaching science in the elementary school setting. The results of these two studies suggest that elementary teaching majors would be better served by taking inquiry-based science courses as part of their preservice preparation instead of lecture-based courses because the inquiry-based lessons did not detract from their chemistry content knowledge; in fact, the inquiry-based science courses markedly changed elementary teaching majors' views on the nature of science.", "Stimuli-responsive drug delivery vehicles have garnered immense interest in recent years due to unparalleled progress made in material science and nanomedicine. However, the development of stimuli-responsive devices with integrated real-time monitoring capabilities is still in its nascent stage because of the limitations of imaging modalities. In this paper, we describe the development of a polypeptide-wrapped mesoporous-silica-coated multicolor upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP@MSN) as an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-responsive drug delivery system (DDS) for long-term tracking and real-time monitoring of drug release. Our UCNP@MSN with multiple emission peaks in UV-NIR wavelength range was functionalized with zinc-dipicolylamine analogue (TDPA-Zn2+) on its exterior surface and loaded with small-molecule drugs like chemotherapeutics in interior mesopores. The drugs remained entrapped within the UCNP-MSNs when the nanoparticles were wrapped with a compact branched polypeptide, poly(Asp-Lys)-b-Asp, because of multivalent interactions between Asp moieties present in the polypeptide and the TDPA-Zn2+ complex present on the surface of UCNP-MSNs. This led to luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) from the UCNPs to the entrapped drugs, which typically have absorption in UV\u2013visible range, ultimately resulting in quenching of UCNP emission in UV\u2013visible range while retaining their strong NIR emission. Addition of ATP led to a competitive displacement of the surface bound polypeptide by ATP due to its higher affinity to TDPA-Zn2+, which led to the release of the entrapped drugs and subsequent elimination of LRET. Monitoring of such ATP-triggered ratiometric changes in LRET allowed us to monitor the release of the entrapped drugs in real-time. Given these results, we envision that our proposed UCNP@MSN-polypeptide hybrid nanoparticle has great potential for stimuli-responsive drug delivery as well as for monitoring biochemical changes taking place in live cancer and stem cells.", "Owing to their ability to confine and manipulate light at the nanoscale, plasmonic nanostructures are highly attractive for a broad range of applications. While tremendous progress has been made in the synthesis of size- and shape-controlled plasmonic nanostructures, their integration with other materials and application in solid-state is primarily through their assembly on rigid two-dimensional (2D) substrates, which limits the plasmonically active space to a few nanometers above the substrate. In this work, we demonstrate a simple method to create plasmonically active three-dimensional biofoams by integrating plasmonic nanostructures with highly porous biomaterial aerogels. We demonstrate that plasmonic biofoam is a versatile optically active platform that can be harnessed for numerous applications including (i) ultrasensitive chemical detection using surface-enhanced Raman scattering; (ii) highly efficient energy harvesting and steam generation through plasmonic photothermal heating; and (iii) optical control of enzymatic activity by triggered release of biomolecules encapsulated within the aerogel. Our results demonstrate that 3D plasmonic biofoam exhibits significantly higher sensing, photothermal, and loading efficiency compared to conventional 2D counterparts. The design principles and processing methodology of plasmonic aerogels demonstrated here can be broadly applied in the fabrication of other functional foams.", 0, "Failure to succeed in introductory science classes is a barrier to diversification of the scientific workforce. In the early 1990s, it was found that Grinnell College students \u2014particularly those of color, women, and first-generation college student\u2014swere entering Grinnell College with an avowed interest in pursuing degrees in the sciences but abandoning their academic goals when they failed to do well in introductory science courses. To address this problem, a program called the Grinnell Science Project was developed to help students overcome three barriers to success in the sciences. We developed this list of barriers from data analysis of performance and issues experienced by students as: (1) unsuccessful acclimation to college life; (2) ineffectiveness of traditional pedagogy; and (3) a lack of mentoring and role models. Results of this project reveal improved grades for domestic students of color, as well as comparable rates of science major completion and pursuit of graduate study for all groups of students. The culture of the Science Division has changed to reflect, both in architecture and in actions, a commitment to establishing a supportive and inclusive community to promote excellent science. The sciences have undergone major curricular reform, including revision of introductory courses throughout the sciences to provide more active and engaged pedagogies and provide increased opportunities for course-embedded and dedicated research experiences.", "We report a coaxial fiber supercapacitor, which consists of carbon microfiber bundles coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes as a core electrode and carbon nanofiber paper as an outer electrode. The ratio of electrode volumes was determined by a half-cell test of each electrode. The capacitance reached 6.3 mF cm\u20131 (86.8 mF cm\u20132) at a core electrode diameter of 230 \u03bcm and the measured energy density was 0.7 \u03bcWh cm\u20131 (9.8 \u03bcWh cm\u20132) at a power density of 13.7 \u03bcW cm\u20131 (189.4 \u03bcW cm\u20132), which were much higher than the previous reports. The change in the cyclic voltammetry characteristics was negligible at 180\u00b0 bending, with excellent cycling performance. The high capacitance, high energy density, and power density of the coaxial fiber supercapacitor are attributed to not only high effective surface area due to its coaxial structure and bundle of the core electrode, but also all-carbon materials electrodes which have high conductivity. Our coaxial fiber supercapacitor can promote the development of textile electronics in near future.", "Chromium silicide nanostructures are fabricated inside silicon nanopillars grown by the vapor\u2212liquid\u2212solid mechanism. The remarkable field-emission behavior of these nanostructures results from extensive improvement of carrier transport due to the reduced energy barrier between the metal and semiconductor layers. The results warrant consideration of chromium silicide as a potentially important contact material in future nanosystems.", "Sometime this month preliminary field tests will begin on a new type of thermoplastic material for filling pavement potholes. If it lives up to the hopes of its sponsor, Washington-based Public Technology, Inc.

And it might open up a market for perhaps 10 million pounds a year of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. It might, that is, if city engineers can be persuaded to use a product they are unfamiliar with and that is also several times more expensive than the asphalt currently used for patching roads.\nThese are the kind of hurdles that have often in the past thwarted attempts to adapt new products to the needs of local government.

Am. Chem. Soc. , 120 , 10976 (1998)]. The reaction was developed by Stanford University chemistry professor Paul A. Wender and postdoctoral fellows Heiko Rieck and Masahiro Fuji.\nThey find that the reaction is remarkably general, with \"electron-rich, electron-poor, conjugated, internal, and terminal alkynes, even acetylene itself,\" efficiently reacting under mild conditions. In the [5 + 2] cycloaddition, the five carbons of the vinylcyclopropane add across the two carbons of an alkyne, forming a seven-membered adduct that yields a cyclic ketone after acidic workup. For example, when the vinyicyclopropane shown here (R = tertbutyldimethyisilyloxy) is treated with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate in the presence of the dimer of rhodium dicarbonyl chloride at 40 \u00b0C for two hours, only one seven- membered cyclic ketone is formed in greater than 90% yield. Wender says the ...", "THE atomic age that we are living in makes science increasingly important but high school students are shunning science courses even though they may be interested in the gadget science of space ships and hot rods. Students just don't realize the importance of science or know of the career opportunities in technical fields according to a survey recently completed by the Future Scientists of America Foundation of the National Science Teachers Association.\nThe foundation polled 425 science teachers employed in schools having a total enrollment of 326,000 students. The schools are located in 42 states.

Although these teachers identified pamphlets as a very good source of such information, they emphasized that the material must get into the hands of students under circumstances that will ...", "Letters to the Editor that appeared within the print issues of C&EN have been included in C&EN Archives to provide a comprehensive representation of each issue.", "One solution to the problem of the great volume and variety of scientific information available to the research worker lies in the establishment of a science information group.", "A clear challenge for the coming decades is decreasing the carbon intensity of the global energy supply while simultaneously accommodating a rapid worldwide increase in power demand. Meeting this challenge of providing abundant, clean energy undoubtedly requires synergistic efforts between basic and applied researchers in the chemical sciences to develop and deploy new technologies. Among the available options, solar energy is one of the promising targets because of the high abundance of solar photons over much of the globe. Similarly, decarbonization of the global energy supply will require clean sources of hydrogen to use as reducing equivalents for fuel and chemical feedstocks. In this report, we discuss the importance of translational research\u2014defined as work that explicitly targets basic discovery as well as technology development\u2014in the context of photovoltaics and solar fuels. We focus on three representative research programs encompassing translational research in government, industry, and academia. We then discuss more broadly the benefits and challenges of translational research models and offer recommendations for research programs that address societal challenges in the energy sector and beyond.", "In order to be able to control the phase transition of engineered phase-change materials, the specific understanding of phase transition processes is essential. To understand the effect of dopant on phase transition, the phase transition processes of Bi5.5(In3SbTe2)94.5 (Bi-IST) are quantitatively investigated with regard to the interfacial, bulk, entropy, and Gibbs free energies involved in the intermediate InSb and InTe phases and the crystallized Bi-IST. In the first step, InSb is crystallized; InTe and Bi are present in the amorphous phase. In the second step, heterogeneous nucleation of crystalline InTe occurs on the InSb. The energy barrier calculated for this nucleation of crystalline InTe is reduced by 1.5 times owing to the interfacial reaction of 5.5 atom % of Bi atoms compared to the case without Bi. In the third step, crystalline InSb and InTe are crystallized to Bi-IST since Bi atoms substitute Sb sites with a higher interfacial energy. The difference in the Gibbs free energy of the Bi-IST is \u22121.4 \u00d7 105 eV, which is lower than the \u22121.1 \u00d7 105 eV of the IST; this is because the differences in entropy with an increase in temperature and the interfacial energy are increased owing to the added Bi atoms. This lower Gibbs free energy becomes a driving force for the stable phase transition of Bi-IST at a lower transition temperature compared with that of the IST. With these phase transition processes, the contribution shares of enthalpy, entropy with temperature change, and interfacial energy are quantitatively analyzed; moreover, we recommend one of the various methods to design a novel phase-change material.", "The lack of intrinsic spin polarization in graphene as well as in its several composites limits their usage as suitable spintronic material. Using long-range dispersion corrected density functional theory, we explore the structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of recently synthesized [Liu, Q.; Zhang, J. Langmuir2013, 29, 3821\u22123828] two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) stacked graphene (C3N4@graphene) where 3d transition metals (TMs) are embedded in the cavity of g-C3N4 (TM-C3N4@graphene). The incorporation of TMs modifies the structure of C3N4@graphene negligibly and keeps graphene almost as in its pristine form. TM inclusion makes the narrow-gap semiconducting C3N4@graphene as metallic. Charge-transfer analysis shows that the TM-C3N4 transfers electrons from the 3d-orbital of TM to the conduction band of graphene, making it n-doped in nature. Importantly, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni embedded C3N4@graphene shows long-range ferromagnetic coupling among TMs in their ground state. The magnetic ordering appears due to suitable ferromagnetic d\u2013p exchange interaction, which is absent in paramagnetic V- and Mn-C3N4@graphene sheets. Furthermore, calculated high charge carrier densities of the n-doped graphene layer in these nanocomposites are quite promising for its usage in ultrafast electronics. Performing Heisenberg model based Monte Carlo simulations, we predict the Curie temperatures for Cr- and Fe-C3N4@graphene as 381 and 428 K, respectively. Moreover, these sheets also demonstrate prominent visible light response, which gives us a clue about their probable photocatalytic activity. Thus, the present study exhibits the true multifunctional behavior of TM-C3N4@graphene by demonstrating its usage in various fields, such as memory devices, spintronics, ultrafast electronics, photocatalysis, etc.", "In order to be able to control the phase transition of engineered phase-change materials, the specific understanding of phase transition processes is essential.

The difference in the Gibbs free energy of the Bi-IST is \u22121.4 \u00d7 105 eV, which is lower than the \u22121.1 \u00d7 105 eV of the IST; this is because the differences in entropy with an increase in temperature and the interfacial energy are increased owing to the added Bi atoms. This lower Gibbs free energy becomes a driving force for the stable phase transition of Bi-IST at a lower transition temperature compared with that of the IST. With these phase transition processes, the contribution shares of enthalpy, entropy with temperature change, and interfacial energy are quantitatively analyzed; moreover, we recommend one of the various methods to design a novel phase-change material.", "The lack of intrinsic spin polarization in graphene as well as in its several composites limits their usage as suitable spintronic material. Using long-range dispersion corrected density functional theory, we explore the structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of recently synthesized [Liu, Q.; Zhang, J. Langmuir2013, 29, 3821\u22123828] two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) stacked graphene (C3N4@graphene) where 3d transition metals (TMs) are embedded in the cavity of g-C3N4 (TM-C3N4@graphene). The incorporation of TMs modifies the structure of C3N4@graphene negligibly and keeps graphene almost as in its pristine form. TM inclusion makes the narrow-gap semiconducting C3N4@graphene as metallic. Charge-transfer analysis shows that the TM-C3N4 transfers electrons from the 3d-orbital of TM to the conduction band of graphene, making it n-doped in nature. Importantly, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni embedded C3N4@graphene shows long-range ferromagnetic coupling among TMs in their ground state. The magnetic ordering appears due to suitable ferromagnetic d\u2013p exchange interaction, which is absent in paramagnetic V- and Mn-C3N4@graphene sheets. Furthermore, calculated high charge carrier densities of the n-doped graphene layer in these nanocomposites are quite promising for its usage in ultrafast electronics. Performing Heisenberg model based Monte Carlo simulations, we predict the Curie temperatures for Cr- and Fe-C3N4@graphene as 381 and 428 K, respectively. Moreover, these sheets also demonstrate prominent visible light response, which gives us a clue about their probable photocatalytic activity. Thus, the present study exhibits the true multifunctional behavior of TM-C3N4@graphene by demonstrating its usage in various fields, such as memory devices, spintronics, ultrafast electronics, photocatalysis, etc.", "For Many thousands of years man has developed desirable flavors by the use of the art of cooking. Only in the last hundred years has man used heat to create aromas which have been found to he useful specifically as food flavorings. At first the practice related to the hydrolysis of proteins to yield products which contained both flavor and taste enhancing properties. The first person to approach the problem scientifically was Dr. Louis Camille Maillard. The discoveries he made on the non-enzymatic browning reactions of proteins/amino acids with polysaccharides/reducing sugars still hears his name and have been the focus of many research papers and symposia. The Maillard Reaction was, indeed, the chemical platform for producing many of the aromas currently used as meat flavors. During the 1950's and 1960's significant discoveries by natural product chemists contributed further to establishing the science of themally created aromas. The oxidation of fat, the reactions of sulfur and the degradation of sugars are only a few examples of the chemical mechanisims which are used today in directing precursor material to produce usable aromas.", "Controlling the interface between bacteria and solid materials has become an important task in biomedical science. For a fundamental and comprehensive understanding of adhesion it is necessary to seek quantitative information about the involved interactions. Most studies concentrate on the modification of the surface (chemical composition, hydrophobicity, or topography) neglecting, however, the influence of the bulk material, which always contributes to the overall interaction via van der Waals forces. In this study, we applied AFM force spectroscopy and flow chamber experiments to probe the adhesion of Staphylococcus carnosus to a set of tailored Si wafers, allowing for a separation of short- and long-range forces. We provide experimental evidence that the subsurface composition of a substrate influences bacterial adhesion. A coarse estimation of the strength of the van der Waals forces via the involved Hamaker constants substantiates the experimental results. The results demonstrate that the uppermost layer is not solely responsible for the strength of adhesion. Rather, for all kinds of adhesion studies, it is equally important to consider the contribution of the subsurface.", "The metal\u2013organic framework material Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) is composed of layers of extended conjugated planes analogous to graphene. We carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to model the electronic structure of monolayer, bilayer, and bulk Ni3(HITP)2. These materials have intriguing electronic properties; for example, appreciable band dispersion is predicted not only in-plane but also perpendicular to the stacking planes. This suggests that, unlike graphene, the material may have appreciable conductivity in all crystallographic directions. Moreover, the bulk and bilayer structures are predicted to be metallic; in contrast, a 2D monolayer of the material exhibits a band gap. Insight obtained from studies of the transition of the material from semiconducting to metallic as the dimensionality increases from 2D to 3D suggests the possibility of producing a 3D semiconducting material by inserting spacer moieties between the layers. Our calculations suggest that it is not energetically favorable for Ni3(HITP)2 to accept a spacer linker (i.e., pyridine); however, changing the coordinating metal to Cr makes spacer insertion energetically favorable. The proposed 3D material is predicted to possess a band gap of \u223c1 eV with electron/hole effective masses similar to that of silicon.", "This paper explores potential contributions of regional material flow accounting to the characterization of environmental pressures. With this aim, patterns of material extraction, trade, consumption, and productivity for the Spanish regions were studied within the 1996\u20132010 period. The main methodological variation as compared to whole-country based approaches is the inclusion of interregional trade, which can be separately assessed from the international exchanges. Each region was additionally profiled regarding its commercial exchanges with the rest of the regions and the rest of the world and the related environmental pressures. Given its magnitude, interregional trade is a significant source of environmental pressure. Most of the exchanges occur across regions and different extractive and trading patterns also arise at this scale. These differences are particularly great for construction minerals, which in Spain represent the largest share of extracted and consumed materials but do not cover long distances, so their impact is visible mainly at the regional level. During the housing bubble, economic growth did not improve material productivity.", "We report herein a hierarchically structured sulfur\u2212carbon (S/C) nanocomposite material as the high surface-area cathode for rechargeable lithium batteries. A porous carbon with a uniform distribution of mesopores of 7.3 nm has been synthesized through a soft-template synthesis method. The potassium hydroxide activation of this mesoporous carbon results in a bimodal porous carbon with added microporosity of less than 2 nm to the existing mesopores without deterioration of the integrity of the original mesoporous carbon. Elemental sulfur has been loaded to the micropores through a solution infiltration method. The resulted S/C composites with various loading level of sulfur have a high surface areas and large internal porosities. These materials have been tested as novel cathodes for Li/S batteries. The results show that the cyclability and the utilization of sulfur in the Li/S batteries have been significantly improved. The large internal porosity and surface area of the micromesoporous carbon is essential for the high utilization of sulfur.", "Water as a potentially benign solvent for reactions and syntheses is discussed. While most laboratory and industrial organic reactions have been carried out in organic solvents, organic reactions in water have attracted more and more attention within the last decade. This resurgence is partly due to the drive for the development of more environmentally safe reaction processes. The use of water for organic and material syntheses, among many other benefits, reduces the volume of organic solvents used in various processes which will result in pollution-prevention.", "Poly-[(R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate] biopolymers, or PHAs, are biocompatible and biodegradable polyesters that can be produced by diverse microbial strains. PHA polymers have found widespread uses in applications ranging from sustainable replacements of nonbiodegradable bulk-commodity plastics to biomaterials. However, further expansion into other markets and industries has generally been limited by the inability to chemically modify these polymers. Recently, our lab engineered E. coli LSBJ, a microbial strain able to produce PHA copolymers with controlled unit compositions from simple and accessible fatty acid feedstocks. We envisioned meaningfully broadening the application spectrum of these materials via production of chemically tractable PHA biopolymers containing \u201cclick\u201d-ready chemical functionalities. With a myriad of applications in mind, in this study we demonstrate the synthesis and biopolymerization of a panel of \u03c9-azido fatty acids and take the first exploratory steps toward demonstrating their conjugation via a strain-promoted azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) reaction. The convenience of accessing these materials will open the door to new applications for functionalized PHA polymers.", "The Avengers, Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes of the Marvel comics universe, saved our planet from an army of hostile aliens and the Norse god of mischief Loki in 2012\u2019s blockbuster hit, Marvel\u2019s The Avengers. We consider here the previously underappreciated role that chemistry and materials science played in keeping Earth safe from this extraterrestial invasion. The chemical composition of Hawkeye\u2019s bow, Iron Man\u2019s suit of armor and Captain America\u2019s shield are discussed, and a scientific mechanism is proposed to account for the \u201cenchanted\u201d aspects of Thor\u2019s hammer, Mjolnir.", "Recent advancements in virtual reality (VR) devices and software environments make it possible to easily incorporate this technology for many applications, including computational materials science. For studying three-dimensional (3D) structure models and related chemical information, we focused on using a commodity VR device (VIVE) and an authoring tool (Unity). To visualize 3D chemical structures, disturbances like judder due to dropped frames should be eliminated from the VR experience to improve simulations. We propose a simple evaluation method that is straightforward for the nonexpert or novice VR user. We examine the major visualization representations including ball, ball and stick, and isosurface systems. For systematic benchmark measurements, a pendulum from the VR device was used to generate periodic oscillatory motion during measurements of a time series in frames per second (fps). For VIVE with a refresh rate of 90 Hz, judder occurred when less than 90 fps. We demonstrated the system size limitations for the results of molecular dynamics simulations of phase separation of ABA block copolymers and experimental observations of filler morphologies in rubber.", "We report a template-free facile technique that allows for the first ever synthesis of a monoclinic Ag2Mo2O7 nanowire (m-Ag2Mo2O7-NW), using a commercially available MoO3 particle. The nanowire possessed high crystallinity and structural homogeneity and strongly suggested that the nanowire was grown through an oriented aggregation mechanism in contrast to the case of a typical solution-phase method. The corresponding bulky counterpart showed no photoresponse; however, a complete structural transformation toward a nanowire triggered activity for O2 evolution in the presence of Ag+ as an electron acceptor under visible-light irradiation.", "The self-assembly of heterogeneous mesoscale systems is mediated by long-range interactions, including van der Waals forces. Diverse mesoscale architectures, built of optically and morphologically anisotropic elements such as DNA, collagen, single-walled carbon nanotubes, and inorganic materials, require a tool to calculate the forces, torques, interaction energies, and Hamaker coefficients that govern assembly in such systems. The mesoscale Lifshitz theory of van der Waals interactions can accurately describe solvent and temperature effects, retardation, and optically and morphologically anisotropic materials for cylindrical and planar interaction geometries. The Gecko Hamaker open-science software implementation of this theory enables new and sophisticated insights into the properties of important organic/inorganic systems: interactions show an extended range of magnitudes and retardation rates, DNA interactions show an imprint of base pair composition, certain SWCNT interactions display retardation-dependent nonmonotonicity, and interactions are mapped across a range of material systems in order to facilitate rational mesoscale design.", "Artificial photosynthetic (AP) approaches to convert and store solar energy will require membranes capable of conducting both ions and electrons while remaining relatively transparent and chemically stable. A new approach is applied herein involving previously described in situ chemical polymerization of electronically conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) in the presence of proton conducting heteropoly acid (HPA) phosphomolybdic acid (PMA). The electrochemical behaviour of the PEDOT/PMA hybrid material was investigated and it was found that the conducting polymer (CP) is susceptible to irreversible oxidative processes at potentials where water is oxidized. This will be problematic in AP devices should the process occur in very close proximity to a conducting polymer-based membrane. It was found that PEDOT grants the system good electrical performance in terms of conductivity and stability over a large pH window; however, the presence of PMA was not found to provide sufficient proton conductivity. This was addressed in an additional study by tuning the ionic (and in turn, electronic) conductivity in creating composites with the proton-permselective polymer Nafion. It was found that a material of this nature with near-equal conductivity for optimal chemical conversion efficiency will consist of roughly three parts Nafion and one part PEDOT/PMA.", "A heparin-conjugated biodegradable polymer (PLA-heparin) by the direct coupling of heparin to polylactide (PLA) was synthesized and characterized. The surface exposed heparin content associated PLA-heparin was measured to be 0.067 \u03bcg/cm2. PLA-heparin coated surface has shown higher hydrophilicity rather than control PLA surface. The clotting time of PLA-heparin conjugate measured by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was significantly prolonged as compared to PLA. The bioactivity of bound heparin measured by APTT corresponds to 17.4% of free heparin. It has been also demonstrated that the conjugation of heparin suppresses the protein adsorption as well as the platelet adhesion. These results indicate that the unique property of bound heparin has an inhibiting influence on the coagulation, plasma protein adsorption, and subsequent platelet adhesion systems. This novel PLA-heparin conjugate could be applied as blood/tissue compatible biodegradable materials for implantable medical devices and tissue engineering.", "In this Perspective, we present a unique approach to the design and synthesis of giant molecules based on \u201cnanoatoms\u201d for engineering structures across multiple length scales and controlling their macroscopic properties. Herein, \u201cnanoatoms\u201d refer to shape-persistent molecular nanoparticles (MNPs) with precisely defined chemical structures and surface functionalities that can serve as elemental building blocks for the precision synthesis of giant molecules by methods such as sequential \u201cclick\u201d approach. Typical \u201cnanoatoms\u201d include those MNPs based on fullerenes, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, polyoxometalates, and folded globular proteins. The resulting giant molecules are precisely defined macromolecules. They include, but are not limited to, giant surfactants, giant shape amphiphiles, and giant polyhedra. Giant surfactants are polymer tail-tethered \u201cnanoatoms\u201d where the two components have drastic chemical differences to impart amphiphilicity. Giant shape amphiphiles not only are built up by covalently bonded MNPs of distinct shapes where the self-assembly is driven by chemical interactions but also are largely influenced by the packing constraints of each individual shape. Giant polyhedra are either made of a large MNP or by deliberately placing \u201cnanoatoms\u201d at the vertices of a polyhedron. In general, giant molecules capture the essential structural features of their small-molecule counterparts in many ways but possess much larger sizes. They are recognized in certain cases as size-amplified versions of those counterparts, and often, they bridge the gap between small molecules and traditional macromolecules. Highly diverse, thermodynamically stable and metastable hierarchal structures are commonly observed in the bulk, thin film, and solution states of these giant molecules. Controlled structural variations by precision synthesis further reveal a remarkable sensitivity of their self-assembled structures to the primary chemical structures. Unconventional nanostructures can be obtained in confined environments or through directed self-assembly. All the results demonstrate that MNPs are unique elements for macromolecular science, providing a versatile platform for engineering nanostructures that are not only scientifically intriguing but also technologically relevant.", "Self-assembled hierarchical MoO2/graphene nanoarchitectures have been fabricated on a large scale through a facile solution-phase process and subsequent reduction of the Mo-precursor/graphene composite. The as-formed MoO2/graphene nanohybrid as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries exhibits not only a highly reversible capacity but also an excellent cycling performance as well as good rate capability. Results show that the hierarchical rods made of primary MoO2 nanocrystals are uniformly encapsulated within the graphene sheets. The synergistic effect of the hierarchical nanoarchitecture and the conducting graphene support may contribute to the enhanced electrochemical performances of the hybrid MoO2/graphene electrode. This work presents a facile synthetic strategy that is potentially competitive for scaling-up industrial production. Besides, the MoO2/graphene hybrids with a well-defined hierarchical topology not only provide flexible building blocks for advanced functional devices, but are also ideal candidates for studying their nanoarchitecture-dependent performances in catalytic and electronic applications.", "A commercial Li4Ti5O12 material was modified by NH4F using a facile and dry method at a low temperature in air. X-ray diffraction reveals that the fluorination did not change the bulk structure of Li4Ti5O12. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates that LiF was formed at the surface and Ti4+ was partially changed into Ti3+. Microscopic images show that some nanoislands were formed on the surface, which enlarged the surface area. Consequently, the NH4F-modified Li4Ti5O12 material exhibited significantly enhanced capacities and rate capabilities, even at low temperatures. The discharge capacity was increased from 149 to 167 mA h g\u20131 at 1 C, and the capacity retention was increased from 17.8 to 52.0% at 15 C. The capacity retention of NH4F-modified Li4Ti5O12 was greater than that of Li4Ti5O12 at each low-temperature point. Additionally, the introduction of F can protect the Li4Ti5O12 material from side reactions with the electrolyte and the atmosphere, enhancing the surface stability and reducing the release of gaseous products. It is believed that the NH4F-modified Li4Ti5O12 with enhanced electrochemical performance is a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries. Furthermore, this facile surface fluorination strategy is amenable to large-scale production.", "We have recently devised a polymer demonstration involving the crosslinking and decrosslinking of alginate, a polysaccharide isolated from seaweed. The polymer is composed of D-mannuronic acid and L-guluronic acid subunits and is a component of cell walls. It is commonly used as a thickener in foods such as ice cream and fruit-filled snacks. For the demonstration, a 2% solution of sodium alginate is poured into a 1% solution of calcium chloride. Nontoxic calcium alginate \"worms\" form due to crosslinking of the polymer. Alternatively, the commercially available antacid Gaviscon can be used as a source of sodium alginate. The crosslinks can then be broken by shaking the worms in brine. The demonstration is a fine addition to any chemical educator's repertoire of polymer experiments.", "A porous conducting polymer/heteropolyoxometalate hybrid material that displays high specific capacitance and low ionic resistance has been prepared for electrochemical supercapacitor applications. Polypyrrole/phosphomolybdate composite films were chemically synthesized in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of sodium sulfate, which acts as a porogen. While the phosphomolydic acid could be removed from the film upon rinsing with pure tetrahydrofuran or acetone, rinsing with water or methanol resulted in retention of the heteropolyoxometalate at a level high enough to easily observe its electrochemistry. The retained phosphomolybdate exhibits fast and reversible redox behavior, adding a significant amount of pseudocapacitance to the polymer. Porous films were obtained by leaching out the sodium sulfate porogen from the films using water. The morphology obtained using this method is altered by varying the monomer-to-porogen ratio. Increasing the porosity increases the rate at which the hybrid material can be charged/discharged (i.e., oxidized/reduced) by increasing the ionic conductivity and in turn lowering the resistor\u2212capacitor time constant of the material. The ability to tune the porosity of the material allows the optimization of performance characteristics for use in supercapacitor applications. Impedance measurements indicate that the ionic conductivity of these porous structures can be increased more than an order of magnitude over that observed for standard conducting polymer films and that the hybrid material displays peak specific capacitance of around 700 F/g as well as excellent reversibility and cyclability.", "A porous conducting polymer/heteropolyoxometalate hybrid material that displays high specific capacitance and low ionic resistance has been prepared for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.

The capacity remains higher than 150 mA h g\u20131 after 180 cylces, indicating high reversible capacity and stable cyclability. The ex situ XRD and HRTEM investigations on the cycled LiF/Fe/G nanocomposites confirm the formation of FeFx and the coexistence of LiF and FeFx at the charged state. Therefore, the heterostructure nanocomposites of LiF/Fe/Graphene with nano-LiF and ultrafine Fe homogeneously anchored on graphene sheets could open up a novel avenue for the application of iron fluorides as high-performance cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries.", "Revealing defects and inhomogeneities of physical and chemical properties beneath a surface or an interface with in-depth nanometric resolution plays a pivotal role for a high degree of reliability in nanomanufacturing processes and in materials science more generally.(1, 2) Nanoscale noncontact depth profiling of mechanical and optical properties of transparent sub-micrometric low-k material film exhibiting inhomogeneities is here achieved by picosecond acoustics interferometry. On the basis of the optical detection through the time-resolved Brillouin scattering of the propagation of a picosecond acoustic pulse, depth profiles of acoustical velocity and optical refractive index are measured simultaneously with spatial resolution of tens of nanometers. Furthermore, measuring the magnitude of this Brillouin signal provides an original method for depth profiling of photoelastic moduli. This development of a new opto-acoustical nanometrology paves the way for in-depth inspection and for subsurface nanoscale imaging of inorganic- and organic-based materials.", "Bed material samples were collected at different times from a full-scale combustion boiler, and bed material deposits were taken from the cyclone and the riser at two different occasions from a wood-fired circulating fluidized bed boiler (104 MWth). The bed materials and the bed material deposits were analyzed with environmental scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (ESEM/EDXS) to determine the characteristics of the formed bed particle layers and bed material deposits. On the basis of their elemental composition, the corresponding melting behavior was estimated, using data extracted from phase diagrams. The bed material was also fractionated by sieving, and the alkali metal concentration dependence on the particle size was determined. The bed material deposits found in the cyclone and the riser consisted of bed particles embedded in a low-temperature melting (sticky) alkali metal silicate (K and Na) that resemble the composition of the layer found around the cracks in older quartz bed particles. The alkali silicate formation, which is in progress in the vicinity of the formed cracks of older quartz bed particles, significantly transforms a large part of the bed particle and makes it less resistant against fragmentation. The results therefore suggest that elutriated alkali silicate-rich fragments from old quartz bed particles are responsible for bed material depositions in cyclones of wood-fired circulating fluidized beds (CFBs).", "General routes to confined spaces of well-defined chemical composition and complex three-dimensional structure have long been sought by materials chemists. Here, we introduce metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) materials as an ideal scaffold upon which such organized complexity can be built. Employing an orthogonal coordination strategy, we constructed a large-pore MOF material with two different modifiable linkers in well-defined positions relative to each other. The independent and quantitative covalent grafting of two distinct chemical groups onto these differently reactive linkers yielded a uniformly bifunctionalized MOF material. Not only does this methodology offer an efficient route via which the properties of well-defined microporous materials can be fine-tuned, but it also creates a solid-state platform for synthetically accessing constructs that better emulate the well-ordered intricacy of biological structures.", "A postage stamp issued in Spain in honor of Antonio de Ulloa, in the context of the third centenary of his birth (1716), is presented. Ulloa, a Spanish naval officer, mathematician, astronomer, and traveler, is commonly credited as the first scientist to describe platinum as a particular metal. Therefore, he had essential importance in the discovery of Pt as an element. This stamp represents an opportunity to connect chemistry concepts (e.g., properties of platinum, nomenclature and symbols of elements, and periodic table), history of science topics (e.g., discovery of platinum and related elements, scientific expeditions, and relevance of science in Spain), and history (e.g., history of Latin America and Spain in the 18th century, biography of Antonio de Ulloa, and historical and cultural links between Spain and the United States).", "Polymers are materials with vast environmental and economic ramifications, yet are generally not discussed in secondary education science curricula. We describe a program in which college mentors develop and implement hands-on, polymer-related experiments to supplement a standard, state regents-prescribed high school chemistry course, as well as a middle school elective course on polymers. Interactive experimentation and feedback-oriented design are highlighted as critical elements to the success of the program. The experiments have been executed in two vastly different institutions: a New York City magnet high school for underprivileged females, and a private middle school for privileged male and female students; the similarities and differences are juxtaposed.", "A new biphasic material composed of hydroxyapatite and a bioactive glass has been synthesized. The starting materials were hydroxyapatite (HA), synthesized by a wet method, and gel obtained by a sol\u2212gel method with composition in mol %, 55SiO2\u221241CaO\u22124P2O5 (55S), both prepared before the mixture. This mixture was performed mechanically and had a final ratio HA/55S glass of 80:20. In vitro assays of bioactivity were carried out to compare the behavior of the three materials. The biphasic material has shown good bioactivity, establishing that the addition of the bioactive glass to the hydroxyapatite accelerates the formation of a hydroxyapatite layer, enhancing the bioactivity of the synthetic HA.", 0, "Degradation of the major benzophenones, iriflophenone-3-C-glucoside-4-O-glucoside and iriflophenone-3-C-glucoside, and the major xanthones, mangiferin and isomangiferin, of Cyclopia genistoides followed first-order reaction kinetics during high-temperature oxidation of the plant material at 80 and 90 \u00b0C. Iriflophenone-3-C-glucoside-4-O-glucoside was shown to be the most thermally stable compound. Isomangiferin was the second most stable compound at 80 \u00b0C, while its degradation rate constant was influenced the most by increased temperature. Mangiferin and iriflophenone-3-C-glucoside had comparable degradation rate constants at 80 \u00b0C. The thermal degradation kinetic model was subsequently evaluated by subjecting different batches of plant material to oxidative conditions (90 \u00b0C/16 h). The model accurately predicted the individual contents of three of the compounds in aqueous extracts prepared from oxidized plant material. The impact of benzophenone and xanthone degradation was reflected in the decreased total antioxidant capacity of the aqueous extracts, as determined using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity and DPPH\u2022 scavenging assays.", "What is the history and justification of the claim that chemistry is \u201cthe central science\u201d? Are our students able to see and appreciate such centrality of the knowledge of chemistry in the curriculum as well as in its broader interconnections with other fields of study and with societal issues? In this editorial for the special issue Reimagining Chemistry Education: Systems Thinking, and Green and Sustainable Chemistry, we, as guest editors, highlight the case made in the collective contributions to the special issue that systems thinking, including green and sustainable chemistry, shows promise as an approach to help chemistry students zoom out from detailed and fragmented disciplinary content to obtain a more holistic view of chemistry and its integral connection to earth and societal systems. Indeed, we ask the following question: How can we as a community of chemists and chemistry educators live up to the claim of being practitioners of the central science if we do not equip our students to engage in systems thinking? We further invite the community to make use of and build upon the contributions in this special issue and participate in a paradigm change in chemistry education that will help prepare our students to be citizens and scientists who are better equipped to deal with the grand challenges in the world.", 0, "Wind energy is key to addressing the global climate challenge, but its development is subject to potential constraints of finite primary materials. Prior studies on material demand forecasting of wind power development are often limited to a few materials and with low technological resolution, thus hindering a comprehensive understanding of the impact of microengineering parameters on the resource implications of wind energy. In this study, we developed a component-by-component and stock-driven prospective material flow analysis model and used bottom-up data on engineering parameters and wind power capacities to characterize the materials demand and secondary supply potentials of wind energy development in Denmark, a pioneering and leading country in wind power. We also explicitly addressed the uncertainties in the prospective modeling by the means of statistical estimation and sensitivity analysis methods. Our results reveal increasing challenges of materials provision and end-of-life (EoL) management in Denmark\u2019s ambitious transition toward 100% renewable energy in the next decades. Harnessing potential secondary resource supply from EoL and extending lifetime could curtail the primary material demand, but they could not fully alleviate the material supply risk. Such a model framework that considers bottom-up engineering parameters with increased precision could be applied to other emerging technologies and help reveal synergies and trade-offs of relevant resource, energy, and climate strategies in the future renewable energy and climate transition.", "Xenon and gold: Joined in chemical matrimony\nThe first isolable compound in which a noble gas is bonded to a metal\u0097a noble metal, at that\u0097has been prepared serendipitously at the Free University Berlin. Chemistry professor Konrad Seppelt and graduate student Stefan Seidel were trying to isolate the elusive gold (I) monofluoride (AuF) by reducing AuF 3 with xenon gas in a superacidic mixture of SbF 5 and liquid anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Instead of AuF, they isolated black crystals of [Au II Xe 4 ] 2+ 2[Sb 2 F11 ] - . Ifs clear from the X-ray crystal structure that the new cation is a square planar complex, Seppelt told colleagues last month at the 16th International Symposium on Fluorine Chemistry, held in Durham, England. The compound is stable at room temperature in pressurized xenon, or at -40 \u00b0C at 1 atm xenon. Seppelt doesn't know whether other metals can be induced to bond to xenon, an element known to form bonds with ...", "We have discovered three new synthetic pathways to our two-dimensional cationic inorganic material, antimony oxide hydroxide ethanedisulfonate, [Sb4O4(OH)2](O3SCH2CH2SO3)\u00b7H2O. These new methods include room temperature conditions and allow control of crystal size and morphology for improved catalytic performance of the material. As a benchmark reaction, we studied ketalization of 2-butanone with 1,2-ethanediol, a common step for carbonyl group protection. Our material is easily recovered for reuse and gives a higher yield and turnover rates than the typical iodine or toluenesulfonate homogeneous catalyst. The yield ranged between 79 and 92%, with the crystals from reflux conditions giving the highest yield when used as-synthesized. The morphology and properties for each crystal growth method are described in detail. A repeated catalysis study with powdered samples increases the yield to ca. 97%.", 0, "MoO2 is one of the most studied anode systems in lithium ion batteries. Previously, the reaction of MoO2 with lithium via conversion reaction has been widely studied. The present study highlights the possible application of MoO2 as an intercalation-based anode material to improve the safety of lithium ion batteries. Nanobelts of MoO2 are prepared by reduction of MoO3 nanobelts under hydrogen atmosphere. The intercalation behavior of MoO2 is specially focused upon by limiting the charge\u2013discharge cycling to narrow potential window of 1.0 to 2.2 V vs Li/Li+ to avoid conversion reaction. An excellent electrochemical stability over 200 cycles is achieved at a current rate of 100 mAh g\u20131. A phase transformation from monoclinic to orthorhombic to monoclinic is observed during the lithiation process, which is reversible during delithiation process and is confirmed by ex-situ XRD and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. To further demonstrate the viability of MoO2 as a commercial anode material, MoO2 is tested in a full-cell configuration against LiFePO4. The full-cell assembly is cycled for 100 cycles and stable performance is observed. The combination showed an energy density of 70 Wh kg\u20131 after 100 cycles.", 0, "Several years ago Utracki and Simha reported a remarkable independence of molar mass of the ratio of the thermodynamic critical (consolute) concentration and the concentration of incipient coil overlap, also known as \u201ccritical\u201d concentration. They investigated solutions of polystyrene in cyclohexane and also found the consolute concentration at the critical temperature to be approximately equal to the average segmental concentration within the coils. Here we supply an explanation for these indisputable experimental findings. To this end we examine three systems for which experimental information about the true consolute state and coil dimensions is available in the literature, viz. cyclohexane/polystyrene, methylcyclohexane/polystyrene, and diphenyl ether/polyethylene. The conclusion is that the two concentration ratios will usually vary with molar mass. The constancy observed by Utracki and Simha can be explained if it is assumed that their anionic polystyrene samples, though having narrow molar-mass distributions as expressed in Mw/Mn, were contaminated with small amounts of high molar-mass material responsible for considerable deviations between maximum-demixing and consolute concentrations. This conclusion is independent of whether the temperature- and concentration dependence of the coil dimensions are taken into account. For the concentration dependence we made use of an expression not published hitherto. Light-scattering data published earlier by Borchard and Rehage clearly demonstrate that the maximum in the 45/135 angular dissymmetry does not occur at the consolute concentration but close to, or at, the concentration at which the spinodal exhibits an extremum. Here we prove the latter point theoretically. The extremum of the spinodal is a consolute point in strictly binary systems only. Hence, the term \u201cspinodal\u201d, rather than \u201ccritical\u201d, opalescence appears to be appropriate to indicate the phenomenon.", "Polymers are part of our lives; scientists dedicated to polymer science design new materials thinking about more eco-friendly methodologies and satisfying people\u2019s needs. In most universities, polymer science is taught by academics associated with the traditional chemistry departments (organic, analytical, physical, and inorganic chemistry). In this article, we show how polymers are taught in a department specifically dedicated to this topic. We present the history of the Department of Polymers in the Faculty of Chemical Sciences at the University of Concepci\u00f3n (the only department of this type in Chile). Initially, the Department of Polymers offered a few undergraduate and graduate courses; now, polymer science courses at the University of Concepci\u00f3n have become an integral part of the curriculum for seven programs\u2014pedagogy in chemistry, biochemistry, bioengineering, civil engineering in materials, chemical analysis, chemistry, and civil engineering in chemistry. We discuss the influence of this department in the curricular design of these seven programs at the University of Concepci\u00f3n. We offer a detailed description of the polymer-based courses incorporated into the curriculum of some programs, and we discuss how the numbers of graduate and undergraduate theses involving polymer science have increased at the Faculty of Chemical Sciences since the creation of the Department of Polymers in 1974.", "This study examines the vehicle-cycle and vehicle total life-cycle impacts of substituting lightweight materials into vehicles. We determine part-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emission ratios by collecting material substitution data and evaluating that alongside known mass-based GHG ratios (using and updating Argonne National Laboratory\u2019s GREET model) associated with material pair substitutions. Several vehicle parts are lightweighted via material substitution, using substitution ratios from a U.S. Department of Energy report, to determine GHG emissions. We then examine fuel-cycle GHG reductions from lightweighting. The fuel reduction value methodology is applied using FRV estimates of 0.15\u20130.25, and 0.25\u20130.5 L/(100km\u00b7100 kg), with and without powertrain adjustments, respectively. GHG breakeven values are derived for both driving distance and material substitution ratio. While material substitution can reduce vehicle weight, it often increases vehicle-cycle GHGs. It is likely that replacing steel (the dominant vehicle material) with wrought aluminum, carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CRFP), or magnesium will increase vehicle-cycle GHGs. However, lifetime fuel economy benefits often outweigh the vehicle-cycle, resulting in a net total life-cycle GHG benefit. This is the case for steel replaced by wrought aluminum in all assumed cases, and for CFRP and magnesium except for high substitution ratio and low FRV.", "A clear challenge for the coming decades is decreasing the carbon intensity of the global energy supply while simultaneously accommodating a rapid worldwide increase in power demand. Meeting this challenge of providing abundant, clean energy undoubtedly requires synergistic efforts between basic and applied researchers in the chemical sciences to develop and deploy new technologies. Among the available options, solar energy is one of the promising targets because of the high abundance of solar photons over much of the globe. Similarly, decarbonization of the global energy supply will require clean sources of hydrogen to use as reducing equivalents for fuel and chemical feedstocks. In this report, we discuss the importance of translational research\u2014defined as work that explicitly targets basic discovery as well as technology development\u2014in the context of photovoltaics and solar fuels. We focus on three representative research programs encompassing translational research in government, industry, and academia. We then discuss more broadly the benefits and challenges of translational research models and offer recommendations for research programs that address societal challenges in the energy sector and beyond.", "A new class of materials for H2 storage is proposed in this work. They can be synthesized by substitution of the OH groups of oxidized graphitic materials with alkoxide OLi groups. This strategy increases the interaction of H2 with the material to 3.7 kcal/mol without affecting its structural stability. A new model material made of OLi-functionalized pillared graphene was studied as a representative of this class of materials by multiscale theoretical techniques. Our simulations showed that for this material, both U.S. Department Of Energy\u2019s gravimetric and volumetric H2 uptake targets are satisfied at low H2 pressures and at 77 K. The effect of changing the pore volume of the material and the O/C atomic ratio on the uptake were investigated and physically explained.", "Mott insulating oxides and their heterostructures have recently been identified as potential photovoltaic materials with favorable absorption properties and an intrinsic built-in electric field that can efficiently separate excited electron\u2013hole pairs. At the same time, they are predicted to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit due to strong electron\u2013electron interaction present. Despite these premises a high concentration of defects commonly observed in Mott insulating films acting as recombination centers can derogate the photovoltaic conversion efficiency. With use of the self-regulated growth kinetics in hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, this obstacle can be overcome. High-quality, stoichiometric LaVO3 films were grown with defect densities of in-gap states up to 2 orders of magnitude lower compared to the films in the literature, and a factor of 3 lower than LaVO3 bulk single crystals. Photoconductivity measurements revealed a significant photoresponsivity increase as high as tenfold of stoichiometric LaVO3 films compared to their nonstoichiometric counterparts. This work marks a critical step toward the realization of high-performance Mott insulator solar cells beyond conventional semiconductors.", "In this contribution, we present a three-step pathway to produce a novel fiber coating, study its embedding in epoxy resin and characterize its nanomechanical properties at the interface between fiber and matrix. Inorganic surfaces were sulfhydrylated for subsequent use in thiol-initiated ene photopolymerization. The influence of water on the sulfhydrylation process was studied to find conditions allowing monomolecular deposition. Surface morphology as well as SH-content were evaluated by UV/vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Brush-like polymer layers (PS and PMMA) were introduced by UV-light initiated surface polymerization of vinyl monomers. Polymer growth and morphology were studied. After embedding, the nanomechanics of the interfacial region of the fibers was studied. AFM force spectroscopy allowed the mapping of the stiffness distribution at the cross-section of the composite with high spatial resolution. Elastic moduli were determined by Hertzian contact mechanics. The individual phases of the composite material (fiber, interphase, and matrix) can be clearly distinguished based on their mechanical response. The synthesis, morphology, and mechanical properties of an interphase based on a polymeric graft-film swollen with matrix material are shown, and perspectives of these novel coatings for improved matrix\u2013fiber compatibility and interfacial adhesion are discussed.", "We have developed a simple method to fabricate a gradient from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity. It is based on the controlled self-assembled monolayer consisting of a thiol molecule on a gold surface and the amplifying effect of the wetting property on a rough surface. Using a relatively dilute HS(CH2)11CH3 solution (0.05 mmol/L), we found that the density of molecules on the surface can be controlled by varying the immersion time. Slowly adding the dilute solution to the container holding the rough gold substrate will lead to a density gradient along the surface. After the complementary adsorption of HS(CH2)10CH2OH, the surface exhibits a gradient from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity. The slope of the gradient can be conveniently tuned by varying the speed of addition. Cassie\u2212Baxter and Wenzel equations are employed to explain this special property based on the rough structure and the molecular composition gradient that have been determined by XPS. This kind of material would provide a larger oriented driving force for many important biological and physical processes and might have potential applications in water droplet movement, oriented axonal specification of neurons, protein adhesion, and so on.", "The metal\u2013organic framework material Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) is composed of layers of extended conjugated planes analogous to graphene. We carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to model the electronic structure of monolayer, bilayer, and bulk Ni3(HITP)2. These materials have intriguing electronic properties; for example, appreciable band dispersion is predicted not only in-plane but also perpendicular to the stacking planes. This suggests that, unlike graphene, the material may have appreciable conductivity in all crystallographic directions. Moreover, the bulk and bilayer structures are predicted to be metallic; in contrast, a 2D monolayer of the material exhibits a band gap. Insight obtained from studies of the transition of the material from semiconducting to metallic as the dimensionality increases from 2D to 3D suggests the possibility of producing a 3D semiconducting material by inserting spacer moieties between the layers. Our calculations suggest that it is not energetically favorable for Ni3(HITP)2 to accept a spacer linker (i.e., pyridine); however, changing the coordinating metal to Cr makes spacer insertion energetically favorable. The proposed 3D material is predicted to possess a band gap of \u223c1 eV with electron/hole effective masses similar to that of silicon.", "Developing multifunctional superwettable materials is highly demanded in the oil/water separation field but remains challenging due to the critical limitations of complex fabrication strategy and high cost. Herein, based on the cost-effective kaolin nanoparticles, we present a convenient and mild strategy for fabricating a smart superwettable material with multiple excellent performances, such as pH-responsive water wettability, self-cleaning property, favorable buoyancy, and air purification performance. By virtue of the dual rough surface structure and special chemical composition, the resultant material surface exhibits a superior pH-dependent wettability, which can be reversibly switched between superamphiphobicity and superhydrophilicity\u2013superoleophobicity for many times in accordance with the pH value of the corresponding aqueous solution. As a result, the obtained superwettable material with reversible and controllable water wettability can be applied in efficient and continuous separation of multiple types of oil/water mixtures, especially the highly emulsified oil/water emulsions, via in situ or ex situ wettability change. To our knowledge, the smart material with the wetting property of superamphiphobicity that can be used for continuous emulsified wastewater purification has been rarely discussed in the emerging research works. In addition, the as-prepared material presents universal applicability to diversiform substrates and exhibits robust durability and stability against high-concentration salt solutions and rigorous mechanical abrasion. All of these above-mentioned advantages indicate that the as-prepared superwettable material will hold great potential in various practical applications, including oily wastewater remediation, smart aquatic device fabrication, liquid droplet manipulation, guiding liquid movement, and optimizing multiple operations in industrial fields.", "Water as a potentially benign solvent for reactions and syntheses is discussed. While most laboratory and industrial organic reactions have been carried out in organic solvents, organic reactions in water have attracted more and more attention within the last decade. This resurgence is partly due to the drive for the development of more environmentally safe reaction processes. The use of water for organic and material syntheses, among many other benefits, reduces the volume of organic solvents used in various processes which will result in pollution-prevention.", "In the present paper, the graphene\u2013ZnO composite with quasi-shell\u2013core structure was successfully prepared using a one-step wet chemical method. The photocatalytic Rhodamine B degradation property and the photoelectrochemical performance of the graphene\u2013ZnO quasi-shell\u2013core composite are dependent on the amount of graphene oxide that is added. When the amount of graphene oxide added is 10 mg, the graphene\u2013ZnO quasi-shell\u2013core composite possesses the optimal photocatalytic degradation efficiency and the best photoelectrochemical performance. An efficient interfacial electric field is established on the interface between the graphene and ZnO, which significantly improves the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs and thus dramatically increases its photoelectrochemical performance. In addition to the excellent photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties, the electron migration ability of the grephene\u2013ZnO quasi-shell\u2013core composite is significantly enhanced due to the graphene coating on ZnO surface; therefore, this material has great potential for application as a substrate material to accept electrons in dye solar cell and in narrow bandgap semiconductor quantum dot sensitized solar cells.", "Black phosphorus (black P), which is a promising candidate as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, was synthesized by a high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) method from white and red phosphorus. The study revealed the electrochemical activity of pure black P under different pressures and temperatures systematically. The sample shows higher crystallinity and purity by the HPHT method. Lithium-ion batteries containing black phosphorus as anode materials exhibited a high specific capacity and excellent cycling performance. Black phosphorus obtained from white phosphorus exhibited the highest first discharge and charge capacities of 2505 and 1354 mAh\u00b7g\u20131 at 4 GPa and 400 \u00b0C and that obtained from red phosphorus exhibited the highest first discharge and charge capacities of 2649 and 1425 mAh\u00b7g\u20131 at 4.5 GPa and 800 \u00b0C. Black P was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.", "A previous study showed that elementary teaching majors enrolled in an inquiry-based physical science course developed chemistry content knowledge comparable to that of students enrolled in traditional lecture-based courses. This current study compares the views of these elementary teaching majors regarding how chemistry is taught and learned to the views of secondary science teaching majors enrolled in science-specific methods courses. The results show that the elementary teaching majors developed views of how science is taught and learned that were more in line with constructivist ideals than the secondary science teaching majors. In addition, the elementary teaching majors improved their interest and confidence in teaching science in the elementary school setting. The results of these two studies suggest that elementary teaching majors would be better served by taking inquiry-based science courses as part of their preservice preparation instead of lecture-based courses because the inquiry-based lessons did not detract from their chemistry content knowledge; in fact, the inquiry-based science courses markedly changed elementary teaching majors' views on the nature of science.", "In material science of elastomers the influence of nanoscale and nanostructured filler particles is of utmost significance for the performance of innovative rubber products, i.e., passenger car tires with ultralow rolling resistance but high wet-grip performance. A better understanding of the physical characteristics of the filler\u2013rubber interface and the filler\u2013rubber interphase as well is necessary to improve the overall macroscopic properties of these elastomeric nanocomposites. Therefore, the surface energies and polarities of filler particles with different modified surfaces were measured by a modified Wilhelmy technique. In all cases the rubber matrix consisted of a solution - styrene butadiene copolymers, filled with 20 or 40 phr pyrogenic or precipitated silica grades with different surface modifications by silanes, and a carbon black sample as reference. A moving die rheometer was employed to observe the filler flocculation at elevated temperatures (160 \u00b0C) in rubber mixtures containing no curatives. A significant influence of the surface energy of the filler was noticed: the flocculation tendency increased with increasing difference in work of adhesion between filler and rubber. In dynamic mechanical measurements the influence of the filler/filler and the filler/polymer interactions were studied in cured S-SBR samples. Amplitude sweep experiments were carried out to investigate the temperature dependent nonlinear characteristics of the elastic and viscous moduli, which is commonly associated with a progressive breakdown of the filler network at higher strain amplitudes (Payne effect). Static measurements and relaxations test were accomplished by large scale strain experiments. A structural\u2013phenomenological modeling of the long strain mechanical properties of these rubber compounds was done: the \u201clayered fiber model\u201d. This new model is based on the hypothesis that during deformation of the composites the polymer chains slipped off from the polymer interphase around the filler particles into the gaps between aggregates, where high-strength polymer fibers in an uniaxially oriented state are formed. We find new interesting correlations between the physicochemical properties of the filler/polymer interface and the macroscopic mechanical properties of the elastomeric materials.", "The Avengers, Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes of the Marvel comics universe, saved our planet from an army of hostile aliens and the Norse god of mischief Loki in 2012\u2019s blockbuster hit, Marvel\u2019s The Avengers. We consider here the previously underappreciated role that chemistry and materials science played in keeping Earth safe from this extraterrestial invasion. The chemical composition of Hawkeye\u2019s bow, Iron Man\u2019s suit of armor and Captain America\u2019s shield are discussed, and a scientific mechanism is proposed to account for the \u201cenchanted\u201d aspects of Thor\u2019s hammer, Mjolnir.", "FOR SOME FOLKS, EVEN SOME scientists, numbers en masse make their eves glaze over. For others, numbers are the essence of their grasp of reality\u2014their way to understand what is going on, and will be going on, around them.\nFor those in the latter category and with a concern for science, the publication of the National Science Foundation's biennial \"Science and Engineering Indicators\" is always something to be relished.

The poignant tale of an impoverished mother and infant son set in 19th-century, famine-stricken Ireland began with this statement: \"The child was slow in coming.\"\nLike the fictional child, some science stories exact an arduous labor from the journalist. When this happens, I tell myself that the story is slow in coming\u2014like the fictional child, it will be born.

Diverse mesoscale architectures, built of optically and morphologically anisotropic elements such as DNA, collagen, single-walled carbon nanotubes, and inorganic materials, require a tool to calculate the forces, torques, interaction energies, and Hamaker coefficients that govern assembly in such systems. The mesoscale Lifshitz theory of van der Waals interactions can accurately describe solvent and temperature effects, retardation, and optically and morphologically anisotropic materials for cylindrical and planar interaction geometries. The Gecko Hamaker open-science software implementation of this theory enables new and sophisticated insights into the properties of important organic/inorganic systems: interactions show an extended range of magnitudes and retardation rates, DNA interactions show an imprint of base pair composition, certain SWCNT interactions display retardation-dependent nonmonotonicity, and interactions are mapped across a range of material systems in order to facilitate rational mesoscale design.", "Daily repeated wound dressing changes will lead to additional trauma to newly formed tissue and prolonging the healing process. In this letter, we designed and fabricated an easily removable wound dressing material. To accomplish this, we first generated cross-linkable supramonomers through host\u2013guest noncovalent interaction, followed by radical copolymerization of acrylamide with supramonomer as cross-linker to fabricate supramolecular hydrogels. Benefiting from the dynamic nature of the supramonomer, the supramolecular hydrogel is able to dissolve upon exposure to memantine, an FDA approved drug, making it easily removed from a wound, representing a promising candidate for the new generation of wound dressing.", "A heparin-conjugated biodegradable polymer (PLA-heparin) by the direct coupling of heparin to polylactide (PLA) was synthesized and characterized. The surface exposed heparin content associated PLA-heparin was measured to be 0.067 \u03bcg/cm2. PLA-heparin coated surface has shown higher hydrophilicity rather than control PLA surface. The clotting time of PLA-heparin conjugate measured by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was significantly prolonged as compared to PLA. The bioactivity of bound heparin measured by APTT corresponds to 17.4% of free heparin. It has been also demonstrated that the conjugation of heparin suppresses the protein adsorption as well as the platelet adhesion. These results indicate that the unique property of bound heparin has an inhibiting influence on the coagulation, plasma protein adsorption, and subsequent platelet adhesion systems. This novel PLA-heparin conjugate could be applied as blood/tissue compatible biodegradable materials for implantable medical devices and tissue engineering.", "A novel fully rigid, rod-shaped oligo(p-benzamide) (OPBA-6) molecule was designed and synthesized, which can be recrystallized into a three-dimensional (3D) multilayer material via an antiparallel molecular packing model. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction are brought to ensure a strong intralayer interaction, while decoration of layer surface with sulfonic groups promotes water to enter interlayer space and facilitates the swelling and exfoliation of sample. With a simple dispersion in water, the obtained multilayer material can be easily swollen by water without destruction of in-plane morphology and subsequently delaminated into 2D nanosheets with thickness of about 5.38 nm. This achievement may be the first attempt to exfoliate layered organic materials and thus provide a new strategy to prepare 2D organic nanosheets without using any substrates or templates as required by conventional and widely used self-assembly routes. Based on exfoliated nanosheets, poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites were prepared using a simple water solution processing method. A 64% increase in tensile stress and a 63% improvement in Young\u2019s modulus were achieved by addition of 7 wt % OPBA-6 loading.", "Blends of poly (ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) (PEMA) and poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) were studied for encapsulating Schottky structured organic devices. A calcium degradation test was used to determine water vapor transmission rates and to determine the moisture barrier performance of neat and blend films. Moisture barrier analysis for the neat and blend compositions was discussed concerning the interactions in the blend, diffusivity of water molecules through the unit cell systems, and the occupiable free volumes available in the unit cells using molecular dynamics simulations. The experimental results of water vapor permeation were correlated with diffusion behavior predicted from molecular dynamics simulations results. The effectiveness of the blend as a suitable barrier material in increasing the lifetime of an encapsulated Schottky structured organic device was determined.", "A hierarchical graphene material composed of micropore (\u223c0.8 nm), mesopore (\u223c4 nm), and macropore (>50 nm) and with a specific surface area up to 1305 m2 g\u20131 is fabricated for physisorption hydrogen storage at atmospheric air pressure, showing a capacity over 4.0 wt %, which is significantly higher than reported graphene materials and all other kinds of carbon materials.", "In the last few decades, hyaluronic acid (HA) has become increasingly employed as a biomaterial in both clinical and research applications. The abundance of HA in many tissues, together with its amenability to chemical modification, has made HA an attractive material platform for a wide range of applications including regenerative medicine, drug delivery, and scaffolds for cell culture. HA has traditionally been appreciated to modulate tissue mechanics and remodeling through its distinctive biophysical properties and ability to organize other matrix proteins. However, HA can influence cell behavior in much more direct and specific ways by engaging cellular HA receptors, which can trigger signals that influence cell survival, proliferation, adhesion, and migration. In turn, cells modify HA by regulating synthesis and degradation through a dedicated arsenal of enzymes. Optimal design of HA-based biomaterials demands full consideration of these diverse modes of regulation. This review summarizes how HA-based signaling regulates cell behavior and discusses how these signals can be leveraged to create cell-instructive biomaterials.", "The dispersion of small amounts of Ce4+ ions in the bulk of ZrO2 leads to a photoactive material sensitive to visible light. This is shown by monitoring with EPR the formation and the reactivity of photogenerated (\u03bb > 420 nm) charge carriers.

However, their successful application is commonly limited by low efficiency, vulnerability to acid/alkali, complex processing procedures, incapability for emulsion separation, etc. Here, a highly durable and robust separation material is developed by coating PDMS-based copolymers on cotton textiles with a facile sol\u2013gel approach. Solely driven by gravity, this new material not only can enable effective separation of oil\u2013water mixture with a flux as high as \u223c7500 L m\u20132 h\u20131 but also can separate surfactant-stabilized water-in-oil emulsion.

However, often, poor chemical and physical durabitity of conventional thin special wettable materials stands in the way of prospective applications of this property at practical settings. A chemically \u201creactive\u201d polymeric gel material is introduced here, and advantage is taken of the robust and facile 1,4-Michael addition reaction between acrylate and primary amine groups to develop a chemically cross-linked and bulk (including interior and surface) superhydrophobic material. A mixture of dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate and branched poly(ethylenimine) (BPEI) can rapidly form a self-standing gel network. On removal of solvent molecules, the synthesized gel network provides a highly porous and reactive polymeric matrix that can be further modified with a variety of small molecules to tailor the liquid water wettability on the synthesized material. This approach provides a facile and rapid process to fabricate a bulk (internally) superhydrophobic material of arbitrary size that can take complex shapes. This property of the material remains intact even after various standard chemical and physical insults.

Recently, electronic devices have come to require more compact designs, so the volumes of loudspeaker should be reduced. However, a small loudspeaker cannot retain sufficient acoustic space, resulting in poor low-frequency acoustic performance. Herein, we investigated acoustic characterization of the CBLSS with different filling materials such as thermally expanded graphene oxide (TEGO), activated carbon, graphene platelets, and melamine foam (MF). Upon the powder-based test, the resonance frequency of the loudspeaker decreased and resulted in a volume increasing effect inside of the loudspeaker. The TEGO shows almost double volume increase rate, compared to other particle-based filling materials. Employing hybrid filling material that consists of TEGO in an MF cage (TEGO@MF), the volume increase rate of the novel loudspeaker was over 24% at 300 cc. Because of the high adsorptive characteristics and thermal properties of TEGO, the acoustic performance in the low-frequency domain was clearly enhanced, despite the reduced mass loading.

The structural analyses of both the complexes by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies clearly revealed the formation of 2D sheets containing guest water molecules entrapped in the 1D channel. A structurally similar reported compound {[Cd1.5(btp)(5-sip)(H2O)3]\u00b72H2O}n (3) has also been synthesized to compare the property of the newly synthesized compound. Herein, all the compounds show their humidity dependent proton conductivity as well as gas sorption behavior, which are signatures of their multifunctionality in the field of not only synthetic chemistry but also in material science. It is worth mentioning that the hydrogen bond network by the guest/coordinated waters, dicarboxylic, as well as sulfonic acid group(s) are present in the interlayer spaces, which are basically responsible for showing this high degree of proton conductivity in addition to significant water adsorption. Interesting phase transformation of compound 1 during experimental study perhaps plays a crucial role for its highest conductivity value among the three reported compounds.

To appreciate how we reached this milestone event and the extent to which human activities have changed the chemistry of Planet Earth, this author encourages chemical educators to introduce the concept of the anthroposphere and to summarize the recent results obtained by material flow analysis (MFA) studies. These studies have generated global maps of metal (e.g., aluminum) flows, demonstrating a significant movement of metal from the lithosphere into the anthroposphere. They also reveal the amount of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the transformation of metal ore and recycled scrap into metal products. In the case of aluminum, the data obtained from MFA studies are easily folded into a discussion of primary aluminum production (the conversion of bauxite into liquid aluminum), the acid\u2013base chemistry associated with the Bayer process, the redox chemistry associated with the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process, and the environmental challenges associated with the byproducts red mud and perfluorocarbons. MFA studies offer a big picture view of some important industrial chemical processes and allow us as chemical educators to address more meaningfully the issue of sustainable practices in light of the magnitude to which humans have changed Earth, leading us into the Anthropocene Epoch.", "We present data on the lithium isotope compositions of glass reference materials from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) determined by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS), thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), and secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS). Our data on the USGS basaltic glass standards agree within 2\u2030, independent of the sample matrix or Li concentration. For SIMS analysis, we propose use of the USGS glasses GSD-1G (\u03b47Li 31.14 \u00b1 0.8\u2030, 2\u03c3) and BCR-2G (\u03b47Li 4.08 \u00b1 1.0\u2030, 2\u03c3) as suitable standards that cover a wide range of Li isotope compositions. Lithium isotope measurements on the silica-rich NIST 600 glass series by MC-ICPMS and TIMS agree within 0.8\u2030, but SIMS analyses show systematic isotopic differences.

However, often, poor chemical and physical durabitity of conventional thin special wettable materials stands in the way of prospective applications of this property at practical settings. A chemically \u201creactive\u201d polymeric gel material is introduced here, and advantage is taken of the robust and facile 1,4-Michael addition reaction between acrylate and primary amine groups to develop a chemically cross-linked and bulk (including interior and surface) superhydrophobic material. A mixture of dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate and branched poly(ethylenimine) (BPEI) can rapidly form a self-standing gel network. On removal of solvent molecules, the synthesized gel network provides a highly porous and reactive polymeric matrix that can be further modified with a variety of small molecules to tailor the liquid water wettability on the synthesized material. This approach provides a facile and rapid process to fabricate a bulk (internally) superhydrophobic material of arbitrary size that can take complex shapes. This property of the material remains intact even after various standard chemical and physical insults. This synthetic strategy could be useful in developing advanced and multifunctional materials to further broadening the applications of this anti-wetting property, including oil/water separation, self-cleaning, sustaining and slow drug release, etc.", "Homogeneous LiF/Fe/Graphene nanocomposites as cathode material for lithium ion batteries have been synthesized for the first time by a facile two-step strategy, which not only avoids the use of highly corrosive reagents and expensive precursors but also fully takes advantage of the excellent electronic conductivity of graphene. The capacity remains higher than 150 mA h g\u20131 after 180 cylces, indicating high reversible capacity and stable cyclability. The ex situ XRD and HRTEM investigations on the cycled LiF/Fe/G nanocomposites confirm the formation of FeFx and the coexistence of LiF and FeFx at the charged state. Therefore, the heterostructure nanocomposites of LiF/Fe/Graphene with nano-LiF and ultrafine Fe homogeneously anchored on graphene sheets could open up a novel avenue for the application of iron fluorides as high-performance cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries.", 0, "A macroporous silica-based 2,6-bis(5,6-di(iso-hexyl)-1,2,4-triazine-3-yl)pyridine (BDIHTP) multinitrogen molecular recognition material, BDIHTP/SiO2-P, was prepared. It was performed through impregnation and immobilization of BDIHTP into the pores of the macroporous SiO2-P particle support with a mean diameter of 50 \u03bcm. The adsorption of some typical alkali metal and alkaline earths Cs(I), Na(I), K(I), Rb(I), Sr(II), and Ba(II), as well as Pd(II), a representative of precious metals, contained in highly active liquid waste (HLW), onto the BDIHTP/SiO2-P material was investigated at 298 K. It was carried out by examining the effects of contact time and the HNO3 concentration in the range 0.3\u20135.0 M. BDIHTP/SiO2-P showed excellent adsorption ability and high selectivity for Pd(II) over all the tested metals, which had weak or almost no adsorption. It was attributed to the strong chemical complexation of Pd(II), a soft Lewis acid and an electron-pair acceptor, with nitrogen inside BDIHTP, a soft Lewis base and an electron-pair donor. On the basis of the related results, the chromatographic separation of Pd(II) from 1.0 M HNO3 solution containing the tested metals was performed by BDIHTP/SiO2-P packed column. Pd(II) was effectively eluted with 0.2 M thiourea and separated from the others. The results are very beneficial to building an effective partitioning of minor actinides and Pd(II) together from HLW by the BDIHTP/SiO2-P materials.", "We determined the relationship between composition and mechanical properties of elytra (modified forewings that are composed primarily of highly sclerotized dorsal and less sclerotized ventral cuticles) from the beetles Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle) and Tenebrio molitor (yellow mealworm). Elytra of both species have similar mechanical properties at comparable stages of maturation (tanning). Shortly after adult eclosion, the elytron of Tenebrio is ductile and soft with a Young\u2019s modulus (E) of 44 \u00b1 8 MPa, but it becomes brittle and stiff with an E of 2400 \u00b1 1100 MPa when fully tanned. With increasing tanning, dynamic elastic moduli (E\u2032) increase nearly 20-fold, whereas the frequency dependence of E\u2032 diminishes. These results support the hypothesis that cuticle tanning involves cross-linking of components, while drying to minimize plasticization has a lesser impact on cuticular stiffening and frequency dependence. Suppression of the tanning enzymes laccase-2 (TcLac2) or aspartate 1-decarboxylase (TcADC) in Tribolium altered mechanical characteristics consistent with hypotheses that (1) ADC suppression favors formation of melanic pigment with a decrease in protein cross-linking and (2) Lac2 suppression reduces both cuticular pigmentation and protein cross-linking.", "In this work, a simple carbazole-based hole transport material with triphenylamine moieties, termed LD22, has been used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

On the other hand, the laboratory synthesis cost of LD22 is much lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, the results indicate that the simple carbazole-triphenylamine compounds own the potential to be doped-free HTM and LD22 could be a promising HTM candidate for high-performance PSCs due to its simple structure.", 0, "I no longer remember the name of a book read long ago in childhood.

The silk materials can be prepared with control of crystallinity, from a low content using conditions at 4 \u00b0C (\u03b1 helix dominated silk I structure), to highest content of \u223c60% crystallinity at 100 \u00b0C (\u03b2-sheet dominated silk II structure). This new physical approach covers the range of structures previously reported to govern crystallization during the fabrication of silk materials, yet offers a simpler, green chemistry, approach with tight control of reproducibility. The transition kinetics, thermal, mechanical, and biodegradation properties of the silk films prepared at different temperatures were investigated and compared by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), uniaxial tensile studies, and enzymatic degradation studies. The results revealed that this new physical processing method accurately controls structure, in turn providing control of mechanical properties, thermal stability, enzyme degradation rate, and human mesenchymal stem cell interactions. The mechanistic basis for the control is through the temperature-controlled regulation of water vapor to control crystallization. Control of silk structure via TCWVA represents a significant improvement in the fabrication of silk-based biomaterials, where control of structure\u2212property relationships is key to regulating material properties. This new approach to control crystallization also provides an entirely new green approach, avoiding common methods that use organic solvents (methanol, ethanol) or organic acids.

Graphene oxide was reduced and functionalized with long chain alkylamine, oleylamine (OA), to adsorb palmitic acid (PA) and was simultaneously self-assembled into a three-dimensional structure. This technique eliminates common freeze-drying and impregnation steps since the phase change material is adsorbed in situ, and there was clearly no shrinkage during the drying process. In addition, the connected graphene network provides nuclei for the heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization of PA with an enhanced heat transfer to and from the PCM and retains excellent shape-stable property which prevents the leakage of molten PA. The obtained composites exhibit a large phase change enthalpy (99.6%), enhanced thermal conductivity (150%), excellent cycling performance, and substantial sunlight adsorption.", "In this work, a simple carbazole-based hole transport material with triphenylamine moieties, termed LD22, has been used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

X-ray diffraction reveals that the fluorination did not change the bulk structure of Li4Ti5O12. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates that LiF was formed at the surface and Ti4+ was partially changed into Ti3+. Microscopic images show that some nanoislands were formed on the surface, which enlarged the surface area. Consequently, the NH4F-modified Li4Ti5O12 material exhibited significantly enhanced capacities and rate capabilities, even at low temperatures. The discharge capacity was increased from 149 to 167 mA h g\u20131 at 1 C, and the capacity retention was increased from 17.8 to 52.0% at 15 C. The capacity retention of NH4F-modified Li4Ti5O12 was greater than that of Li4Ti5O12 at each low-temperature point. Additionally, the introduction of F can protect the Li4Ti5O12 material from side reactions with the electrolyte and the atmosphere, enhancing the surface stability and reducing the release of gaseous products. It is believed that the NH4F-modified Li4Ti5O12 with enhanced electrochemical performance is a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries.

The performance of such DNA-modified particles is greatly dependent on the degree of surface coverage, but existing methods for quantitation can only be employed for certain particle compositions and/or conjugation chemistries. We have developed a simple and broadly applicable exonuclease III (Exo III) digestion assay based on the cleavage of phosphodiester bonds\u2014a universal feature of DNA-modified particles\u2014to accurately quantify DNA probe surface coverage on diverse, commonly used particles of different compositions, conjugation chemistries, and sizes. Our assay utilizes particle-conjugated, fluorophore-labeled probes that incorporate two abasic sites; these probes are hybridized to a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand, and quantitation is achieved via cleavage and digestion of surface-bound probe DNA via Exo III\u2019s apurinic endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities. The presence of the two abasic sites in the probe greatly speeds up the enzymatic reaction without altering the packing density of the probes on the particles. Probe digestion releases a signal-generating fluorophore and liberates the intact cDNA strand to start a new cycle of hybridization and digestion, until all fluorophore tags have been released. Since the molar ratio of fluorophore to immobilized DNA is 1:1, DNA surface coverage can be determined accurately based on the complete release of fluorophores. Our method delivers accurate, rapid, and reproducible quantitation of thiolated DNA on the surface of gold nanoparticles, and also performs equally well with other conjugation chemistries, substrates, and particle sizes, and thus offers a broadly useful assay for quantitation of DNA surface coverage.", "ONE COULD SAY THAT MIL-101 is mostly nothing, but that's saying a lot: MIL-101 is a new, unusually porous material whose unit cell has an unprecedented volume of about 702,000 \u00c5 3 , meaning that the solid is about 90% empty space once the solvent molecules normally filling its pores are removed.

One of the key features to be considered is the representation of the material transfer operations between process stages. A nonzero time as well as certain conditions and resources are always required to move the material from one processing stage to the next one according to the specified product recipe. The transfer task consumes a period of time during which a proper synchronization of the equipment units supplying and receiving the material is enforced. Synchronization implies that during the execution of the transfer task, one unit will be supplying the material whereas the other one will be receiving it and consequently, no other task can be simultaneously performed in both units. Most of the existing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization approaches have traditionally dealt with the batch scheduling problem assuming zero transfer times, and consequently no synchronization, between consecutive processing stages. Simplification relying on negligible transfer times may work properly for the scheduling of multiproduct batch plants with similar product recipes; however, it is demonstrated in this work that ignoring the important role of transfer times may seriously compromise the feasibility of the scheduling whenever shared units and storage tanks, material recycles, or bidirectional flows of products are to be considered. To overcome the serious limitations of current MILP-based scheduling approaches, a general precedence-based framework accounting for nonzero transfer times is introduced. Also, two alternative methods that avoid generating unfeasible schedules are proposed and tested in different case studies.", 0, "Delivery of high capacity with high thermal and air stability is a great challenge in the development of Ni-rich layered cathodes for commercialized Li-ion batteries (LIBs).

The question of what is better education and how we should go about making it available is another matter.

Intermolecular hydrogen bonding and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction are brought to ensure a strong intralayer interaction, while decoration of layer surface with sulfonic groups promotes water to enter interlayer space and facilitates the swelling and exfoliation of sample. With a simple dispersion in water, the obtained multilayer material can be easily swollen by water without destruction of in-plane morphology and subsequently delaminated into 2D nanosheets with thickness of about 5.38 nm. This achievement may be the first attempt to exfoliate layered organic materials and thus provide a new strategy to prepare 2D organic nanosheets without using any substrates or templates as required by conventional and widely used self-assembly routes. Based on exfoliated nanosheets, poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites were prepared using a simple water solution processing method.

Different from the traditional seed swelling emulsion polymerization that usually involved using cross-linked polystyrene (PS) particles as seeds to produce Janus particles, we preloaded non-cross-linked PS particles in the emulsion system to construct an interfacial polymerization system. However, the role of these non-cross-linked PS particles in the emulsion interfacial polymerization is unclear. In this work, we revealed the role of non-cross-linked PS particles preloaded in emulsion interfacial polymerization for fabricating uniform Janus particles with controllable topology. We found that the introduction of non-cross-linked PS particles could significantly control the topology and uniformity of Janus particles. Theoretical simulation results by dissipative particle dynamics simulation coupled with stochastic reaction model revealed that the polymer chains of PS inside oil droplets play a decisive role in the topographic control of Janus particles. These hydrophobic PS chains could slow down the polymerization inside oil droplets due to shielding effect of the PS chains to the newly formed poly(styrene\u2013divinylbenzene) (PSDVB) nucleus. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that the diverse topology features of Janus particles could be tuned by regulating the concentration of PS polymer and monomers. These results may help us to comprehensively understand the mechanism of emulsion interfacial polymerization methodology and design new functional particle materials.", "Diamond-based implant materials make up an emerging research area where the materials could be prepared to promote cellular functions, decrease bacteria attachment, and be suitable for potential in situ imaging. Up until now, diamond implants have been fabricated using coating technologies or embedding diamond nanoparticles in polymer matrices. Here we demonstrated a method of manufacturing diamond implants using laser cladding technology to 3D print a composite of diamond and fused titanium material. Using this method, we could prepare composite scaffolds of up to 50% diamond, which has never been achieved before. We next investigated the interfacial properties of these scaffolds for potential applications in implants. The addition of diamond to the biomaterial results in a 30% decrease in the water contact angle, making the scaffolds more hydrophilic and improving cellular adhesion and proliferation.", "THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY Office of K-8 Science has recently released the third edition of its book \"Inquiry in Action-Investigating Matter Through Inquiry.\" Written as a physical science activity guide for upper elementary- and middle-school teachers, the book focuses on inquiry-based learning, which encourages students to think and ask questions rather than memorize information.\n\"A big part of inquiry is thinking about why you're doing what you're doing and understanding how you came to know what you know,\" says James Kessler, manager of the Office of K-8 Science and one of the book's authors. \"Being able to understand how you came to the knowledge is as important as the knowledge itself.\"\nJoe Exline, founder of Exline Consulting Services and an expert in inquiry-based learning, believes that \"we're boring kids to death with some of the things we're doing in science.\" He explains: \"Science is often taught as ...", "Closed-box loudspeaker systems (CBLSSs) are compact and simple air-suspension loudspeaker systems, and their low-frequency responses are determined by two fundamental parameters: resonance frequency and total damping. Recently, electronic devices have come to require more compact designs, so the volumes of loudspeaker should be reduced. However, a small loudspeaker cannot retain sufficient acoustic space, resulting in poor low-frequency acoustic performance. Herein, we investigated acoustic characterization of the CBLSS with different filling materials such as thermally expanded graphene oxide (TEGO), activated carbon, graphene platelets, and melamine foam (MF). Upon the powder-based test, the resonance frequency of the loudspeaker decreased and resulted in a volume increasing effect inside of the loudspeaker. The TEGO shows almost double volume increase rate, compared to other particle-based filling materials. Employing hybrid filling material that consists of TEGO in an MF cage (TEGO@MF), the volume increase rate of the novel loudspeaker was over 24% at 300 cc. Because of the high adsorptive characteristics and thermal properties of TEGO, the acoustic performance in the low-frequency domain was clearly enhanced, despite the reduced mass loading. Furthermore, these properties were observed to be highly effective for enhancing the low-frequency acoustic performance of the larger loudspeaker, achieving a volume increase rate of 49.5% in a 700 cc enclosure.", "In this contribution, we present a three-step pathway to produce a novel fiber coating, study its embedding in epoxy resin and characterize its nanomechanical properties at the interface between fiber and matrix. Inorganic surfaces were sulfhydrylated for subsequent use in thiol-initiated ene photopolymerization. The influence of water on the sulfhydrylation process was studied to find conditions allowing monomolecular deposition. Surface morphology as well as SH-content were evaluated by UV/vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Brush-like polymer layers (PS and PMMA) were introduced by UV-light initiated surface polymerization of vinyl monomers. Polymer growth and morphology were studied. After embedding, the nanomechanics of the interfacial region of the fibers was studied. AFM force spectroscopy allowed the mapping of the stiffness distribution at the cross-section of the composite with high spatial resolution. Elastic moduli were determined by Hertzian contact mechanics. The individual phases of the composite material (fiber, interphase, and matrix) can be clearly distinguished based on their mechanical response. The synthesis, morphology, and mechanical properties of an interphase based on a polymeric graft-film swollen with matrix material are shown, and perspectives of these novel coatings for improved matrix\u2013fiber compatibility and interfacial adhesion are discussed.", 0, "As an alternative to pure lithium-ion, Li+, systems, a hybrid magnesium, Mg2+, and Li+ battery can potentially combine the high capacity, high voltage, and fast Li+ intercalation of Li-ion battery cathodes and the high capacity, low cost, and dendrite-free Mg metal anodes. Herein, we report on the use of two-dimensional titanium carbide, Ti3C2Tx (MXene), as a cathode in hybrid Mg2+/Li+ batteries, coupled with a Mg metal anode. Free-standing and flexible Ti3C2Tx/carbon nanotube composite \u201cpaper\u201d delivered \u223c100 mAh g\u20131 at 0.1 C and \u223c50 mAh g\u20131 at 10 C. At 1 C the capacity was maintained for >500 cycles at 80 mAh g\u20131. The Mo2CTx MXene also demonstrated good performance as a cathode material in this hybrid battery.

This is shown by monitoring with EPR the formation and the reactivity of photogenerated (\u03bb > 420 nm) charge carriers.

This solid can be considered an example of a third-generation photoactive material.", "Student cognitive constructions are based on a variety of information students experience, such as media, personal experience, and previous classroom work. The student constructs experiencial information together to create theories about how the world works around them. The study of student misconceptions, ideas that differ from the commonly accepted theories that are accepted by experts in the field, can give an insight into how students are cognitively connecting ideas together and formulating educational theories that are harmful to the student and to their academic career. Researchers (Erickson, G. L. Sci. Educ. 1980, 64, 323\u2212336; Doran, R. L. J Res. Sci.

Understanding how high achieving students construct concepts and what types of misconceptions are present may give new information into the role curricula plays in student learning.

A computer simulation is described for injection mold filling and cooling in complex shaped cavities. Both fountain flow and coupling of crystallization kinetics within the equation of transport have a profound influence on the predictions of the thermo-mechanical history experienced by the material. A summary of some polymer crystallization kinetics models is included. Comparisons are made between the Avrami and Tobin models. Some practical relationships are outlined for evaluating the effects of induction time, pressure, and stress on crystallization kinetics. Direct and inverse models are outlined to estimate thermal stresses and the optimal temperature or pressure conditions during injection molding required to obtain a prescribed distribution of the thermal stresses.", "ZrO2\u2212carbon nanotube (CNT) composites have been successfully synthesized via decompositoin of Zr(NO3)4\u00b75H2O in supercritical carbon dioxide\u2212ethanol solution with dispersed CNTs at relatively low temperatures. The samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses. It was demonstrated that CNTs were fully coated with an amorphous ZrO2 layer, and the coating layer was nominally complete and uniform. In addition, the thickness of the coating sheath could be readily controlled by tuning the Zr(NO3)4\u00b75H2O/CNTs ratio used. Furthermore, the chemiluminescent sensor prepared from ZrO2\u2212carbon nanotube composites exhibited dramatic sensitivity as well as high stability and selectivity to ethanol.", 0, "Two new mixed ligand coordination polymers (CPs) that are sulfonic group functionalized, namely, {[Cd(bpe)0.5(5-sip)(H2O)]\u00b74H2O(bpeH2)0.5}n (1) and {[Cd1.5(bte)(5-sip)(H2O)3]\u00b73H2O}n (2) [where 5-sip = trinegative 5-sulfoisophthalate salt, bpe = 4,4\u2032-bispyridylethane, bte = 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethane] have been synthesized through the variation of the N,N\u2032-donor connectors only, at room temperature by using a slow diffusion technique. The structural analyses of both the complexes by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies clearly revealed the formation of 2D sheets containing guest water molecules entrapped in the 1D channel. A structurally similar reported compound {[Cd1.5(btp)(5-sip)(H2O)3]\u00b72H2O}n (3) has also been synthesized to compare the property of the newly synthesized compound. Herein, all the compounds show their humidity dependent proton conductivity as well as gas sorption behavior, which are signatures of their multifunctionality in the field of not only synthetic chemistry but also in material science. It is worth mentioning that the hydrogen bond network by the guest/coordinated waters, dicarboxylic, as well as sulfonic acid group(s) are present in the interlayer spaces, which are basically responsible for showing this high degree of proton conductivity in addition to significant water adsorption. Interesting phase transformation of compound 1 during experimental study perhaps plays a crucial role for its highest conductivity value among the three reported compounds. Herein it has found that the proton conductivity values vary in the range of \u223c10\u20135\u201310\u20137 S cm\u20131 at 65 \u00b0C under 95% relative humidity (RH) corroborating the Grotthus mechanism of proton conduction. All the dehydrated frameworks exhibit adsorption of different gases (e.g., CO2 and N2) and solvents (e.g., EtOH and H2O). In the case of compound 1 and 3, selective CO2 uptake has been observed.", 0, "The crystal structure of the promising Li-ion battery cathode material LiFeBO3 has been redetermined based on the results of single crystal X-ray diffraction data. A commensurate modulation that doubles the periodicity of the lattice in the a-axis direction is observed. When the structure of LiFeBO3 is refined in the 4-dimensional superspace group C2/c(\u03b10\u03b3)00, with \u03b1 = 1/2 and \u03b3 = 0 and with lattice parameters of a = 5.1681 \u00c5, b = 8.8687 \u00c5, c = 10.1656 \u00c5, and \u03b2 = 91.514\u00b0, all of the disorder present in the prior C2/c structural model is eliminated and a long-range ordering of 1D chains of corner-shared LiO4 is revealed to occur as a result of cooperative displacements of Li and O atoms in the c-axis direction. Solid-state hybrid density functional theory calculations find that the modulation stabilizes the LiFeBO3 structure by 1.2 kJ/mol (12 meV/f.u.), and that the modulation disappears after delithiation to form a structurally related FeBO3 phase. The band gaps of LiFeBO3 and FeBO3 are calculated to be 3.5 and 3.3 eV, respectively. Bond valence sum maps have been used to identify and characterize the important Li conduction pathways, and suggest that the activation energies for Li diffusion will be higher in the modulated structure of LiFeBO3 than in its unmodulated analogue.", "Frontiers in Science and Technology is a 3-credit, non-science-majors course. It consists of one 2-hour lab and two 1-hour lectures per week. The course components are arranged to permit starting an experiment in the morning, allowing it to \"happen\" between periods, and completing it in the afternoon \"lecture\" section. Lecture and lab mixing occurs throughout the course and is driven by the project-focused lab agenda. Lecture topics follow an evolutionary story line starting with the Big Bang, through the development of stars and planets to life on earth. The topics of bonding, structure, and interactions are aided by molecular modeling. Biomolecules are built, followed by the fundamentals of molecular biology, followed by topical coverage of the advances and consequences of biotechnology. The laboratory involves cooperative learning and is project directed. The three projects are (i) probability and the nature of radioactivity; (ii) molecular modeling; and (iii) cloning of the gene for bioluminescence. The nature of the laboratory experience breaks several paradigms normally associated with a chemistry lab experience. Student evaluation of the course is very positive, the most important result being that these non-science-majors gain a substantial amount of confidence working in the lab.", "Atomic membranes of monolayer 2D materials represent the ultimate limit in the size of nano-electromechanical systems. However, new properties and new functionalities emerge by looking at the interface between layers in heterostructures of 2D materials. Here, we demonstrate the integration of 2D heterostructures as tunable nano-electromechanical systems, exploring the competition between the mechanics of the ultrathin membrane and the incommensurate van der Waals interface. We fabricate electrically contacted 5 or 6 \u03bcm circular drumheads of suspended heterostructure membranes of monolayer graphene on monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which we call a 2D bimorph. We characterize the mechanical resonance through electrostatic actuation and laser interferometry detection. The 2D bimorphs have resonance frequencies of 5\u201320 MHz and quality factors of 50\u2013700, comparable to resonators from monolayer or few-layer 2D materials. The frequencies and eigenmode shapes of the higher harmonics display split degenerate modes, showing that the 2D bimorphs behave as membranes with asymmetric tension. The devices display dynamic ranges of 44 dB, with an additional nonlinearity in the dissipation at small drive. Under electrostatic frequency tuning, devices display a small tuning of \u223c20% compared with graphene resonators, which have >100%. In addition, the tuning shows a kink that deviates from the tensioned membrane model for atomic membranes and corresponds with a changing in stress of 14 mN/m. A model that accounts for this tuning behavior is the onset of interlayer slip in the heterostructure, allowing the tension in the membrane to relax. Using density functional theory simulations, we find that the change in stress at the kink is much larger than the predicted energy barrier for interlayer slip of 0.102 mN/m in an incommensurate 2D heterostructure but smaller than the energy barrier for an aligned graphene bilayer of 35 mN/m, suggesting a local pinning effect at ripples or folds in the heterostructure. Finally, we observe an asymmetry in tuning of the full width at half-maximum that does not exist in monolayer resonators. These findings demonstrate a new class of nano-electromechanical systems from 2D heterostructures and unravel the complex interaction of membrane morphology versus interlayer adhesion and slip on the mechanics of incommensurate van der Waals interfaces.", "Letters to the Editor that appeared within the print issues of C&EN have been included in C&EN Archives to provide a comprehensive representation of each issue.", "The promising complex structures of graphene nanocapsules with in situ formed graphene sheets (GC-Gs) have been generated by partially peeling the multiwalled graphene capsules (MWGCs) with a small size of ca. 15 nm. The abundant edges and defects on the in situ induced graphene sheets and capsule walls largely favored the lithiation/delithiation reaction and resulted in a high Li-ion storage level. Since the surface area loss of GC-Gs during stacking and aggregation is generally avoided due to the branched structures and the active doping atoms (N, S) can be intercalated into the carbon lattices during sample preparation, the unique GC-Gs possess an excellent reversible capacity of 1373 mAh g\u20131 at 0.5 A g\u20131 as anode material in lithium-ion batteries.

Somorjai isn\u2019t very tall.

Specifically, we focus on three representative click chemistry mechanisms: Diels\u2013Alder reactions, azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition, and thiol\u2013ene chemistry. Apart from that, we also discuss photoinitiated chain growth polymerization, which also has fast kinetics. The chemical mechanisms of these reactions, along with their advantages and disadvantages, are presented. These gelation methods are compared and contrasted with other methods of forming hydrogels. Further, we offer an insight on the fabrication of click chemistry hydrogels from a material selection perspective. Commonly used materials from both synthetic and naturally derived polymer families were selected and discussed with their special features and drawbacks in fabricating hydrogels used in tissue engineering applications. At the end, the impact of cross-linking mechanisms and hydrogels properties on the host response is discussed. In conclusion, click reactions are modular and stereospecific. These reactions proceed rapidly with high selectivity, which means they have the potential to be formed in situ with minimal interference on biological processes.

The attachment of alkyl groups to the surface, the structure of the bonded layer, and changes in the mesoporous structure of the FSM-16 material upon functionalization were studied by means of high-resolution thermogravimetry, elemental analysis, nitrogen adsorption, and 13C and 29Si NMR. Surface coverages of attached ligands were in the range of 0.85\u22122.60 mmol/g. All modified samples showed a decrease in the pore size, which was in relation to the size of attached ligands. The uniformity of pores upon modification proves that the mesoporous structure of FSM-16 is retained after modification. The attachment of ligands takes place in a solvent either with a small amount of water or anhydrous indicating a direct reaction between the chlorosilane molecule and silanol groups and/or a reaction autocatalyzed by the small amount of water present on the FSM-16 surface. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms and the adsorption energy distributions calculated from these isotherms revealed the presence of highly ordered alkyl ligands and the existence of the screening effect produced by alkyl groups as a result of weak interactions of nitrogen probe molecules with attached long alkyl chains. Thermal stability of modified samples greatly depends on the conformation of attached ligands. By using appropriate solvent and/or thermal treatment of modified samples, it was possible to achieve higher ordering of attached groups and consequently higher thermal stability of the resulting bonded phases. The studies of silicon spin\u2212lattice relaxation times T1 support the formation of ligand structures on the surface and show that the surface accessibility greatly decreases with increasing length of attached ligands and with refinement of the ordering of ligands on the surface.

More remarkably, contrary to bilayer phosphorene which possesses dramatically reduced carrier mobility compared to its monolayer counterpart, CaP3 bilayer possesses even higher electron mobility (22\u202f380 cm2 V\u20131 s\u20131) than its monolayer counterpart. The band gap of 2D CaP3 can be tuned over a wide range from 1.15 to 0.37 eV (HSE06 values) through controlling the number of stacked CaP3 layers.

Several tilt series of energy-filtered images were acquired on the K ionization edges of carbon and nitrogen on a multiwalled N-CNT containing a high amount of nitrogen. Two tilt series of carbon and nitrogen 2D maps were then calculated from the corresponding energy-filtered images by using a proper extraction procedure of the chemical signals. Applying iterative reconstruction algorithms provided two spatially correlated C and N elemental-selective volumes, which were then simultaneously analyzed with the shape-sensitive reconstruction deduced from Zero-Loss recordings. With respect to the previous findings, crucial information obtained by analyzing the 3D chemical maps was that, among the two different kind of arches formed in these nanotubes (transversal or rounded ones depending on their morphology), the transversal arches contain more nitrogen than do the round ones. In addition, a detailed analysis of the shape-sensitive volume allowed the observation of an unexpected change in morphology along the tube axis: close to the round arches (with less N), the tube is roughly cylindrical, whereas near the transversal ones (with more N), its shape changes to a prism. This relatively new technique is very powerful in the material science because it combines the ability of the classical electron tomography to solve 3D structures and the chemical selectivity of the EFTEM imaging.", "Coexistence of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in a single 2D material is highly desirable for integration of multifunctional units in 2D material-based circuits.

In this paper, we study the role of the hydrogen bond in thermal transport across interfaces between hard and soft materials with different surface functionalizations around room temperature using molecular dynamics simulations. Gold (Au) is studied as the hard material, and four different types of organic liquids with different polarizations, including hexane (C5H11CH3), hexanamine (C6H13NH2), hexanol (C6H13OH), and hexanoic acid (C5H11COOH), are used to represent the soft materials. To study the hydrogen bonds at the Au/organic liquid interface, three types of thiol-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules, including 1-hexanethiol [HS(CH2)5CH3], 6-mercapto-1-hexanol [HS(CH2)6OH], and 6-mercaptohexanoic acid [HS(CH2)5COOH], are used to functionalize the Au surface. These SAM molecules form hydrogen bonds with the studied organic liquids with varying strengths, which are found to significantly improve efficient interfacial thermal transport. Detailed analyses on the molecular-level details reveal that such efficient thermal transport originates from the collaborative effects of the electrostatic and van der Waals portions in the hydrogen bonds. It is found that stronger hydrogen bonds will pull the organic molecules closer to the interface. This shorter intermolecular distance leads to increased interatomic forces across the interfaces, which result in larger interfacial heat flux and thus higher thermal conductance. These results can provide important insight into the design of hard/soft materials or structures for a wide range of applications.", "Atomically thin 2D van der Waals (2D-vDW) materials have attracted significant attention for optoelectronic applications in photodetectors, photovoltaics, and quantum information science.

Herein, we predict that monolayer CaP3 is a new 2D functional material that possesses not only a direct band gap of 1.15 eV (based on HSE06 computation) but also a very high electron mobility up to 19\u202f930 cm2 V\u20131 s\u20131, comparable to that of monolayer phosphorene. More remarkably, contrary to bilayer phosphorene which possesses dramatically reduced carrier mobility compared to its monolayer counterpart, CaP3 bilayer possesses even higher electron mobility (22\u202f380 cm2 V\u20131 s\u20131) than its monolayer counterpart. The band gap of 2D CaP3 can be tuned over a wide range from 1.15 to 0.37 eV (HSE06 values) through controlling the number of stacked CaP3 layers. Besides novel electronic properties, 2D CaP3 also exhibits optical absorption over the entire visible-light range. The combined novel electronic, charge mobility, and optical properties render 2D CaP3 an exciting functional material for future nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications.", "Topics considered in a forensic science course. From \"Chemistry for Citizens: A Symposium\".", "Highly controlled mixed molecular layers are crucial to study the role of material surface chemistry in biointerfaces, such as bacteria and subsequent biofilms interacting with biomaterials. Silanes with non-nucleophilic functional groups are promising to form self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) due to their low sensitivity to side-reactions. Nevertheless, the real control of surface chemistry, layer structure, and organization has not been determined. Here, we report a comprehensive synthesis and analysis of undecyltrichlorosilane- and 11-bromoundecyltrichlorosilane-based mixed SAMs on silicon substrates. The impact of the experimental conditions on the control of surface chemistry, layer structure, and organization was investigated by combining survey and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, wettability measurements, and ellipsometry. The most appropriate conditions were first determined for elaborating highly reproducible, but easily made, pure 11-bromoundecyltrichlorosilane SAMs. We have demonstrated that the control is maintained on more complex surfaces, i.e., surfaces revealing various chemical densities, which were obtained with different ratios of undecyltrichlorosilane and 11-bromoundecyltrichlorosilane. The control is also maintained after bromine to amine group conversion via SN2 bromine-to-azide reactions. The appropriateness of such highly controlled amino- and methyl-group revealing platforms (NH2\u2013X%/CH3) for biointerface studies was shown by the higher reproducibility of bacterial adhesion on NH2\u2013100%/CH3 SAMs compared to bacterial adhesion on molecular layers of overall similar surface chemistry but less control at the molecular scale.", 0, "The promising complex structures of graphene nanocapsules with in situ formed graphene sheets (GC-Gs) have been generated by partially peeling the multiwalled graphene capsules (MWGCs) with a small size of ca. 15 nm. The abundant edges and defects on the in situ induced graphene sheets and capsule walls largely favored the lithiation/delithiation reaction and resulted in a high Li-ion storage level. Since the surface area loss of GC-Gs during stacking and aggregation is generally avoided due to the branched structures and the active doping atoms (N, S) can be intercalated into the carbon lattices during sample preparation, the unique GC-Gs possess an excellent reversible capacity of 1373 mAh g\u20131 at 0.5 A g\u20131 as anode material in lithium-ion batteries. This value is more than 3 times that of the theoretical capacity of state-of-the-art graphite counterpart, and higher than those of most carbon materials reported to date and even the composites of metal, alloys with carbon materials.", "The search for stable polymeric nitrogen and polynitrogen compounds has attracted great attention due to their potential applications as high-energy-density materials. Here we report a theoretical prediction of an interesting LiN5 crystal through first-principles calculations and unbiased structure searching techniques. Theoretical calculations reveal that crystalline LiN5 is thermodynamically stable at pressures above 9.9 GPa, and remains metastable at ambient conditions. The metastability of LiN5 stems from the inherent stability of the N5\u2013 anions and strong anion\u2013cation interactions. It is therefore possible to synthesize LiN5 by compressing solid LiN3 and N2 gas under high pressure and quench recover the product to ambient conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that stable N5\u2013 anions are predicted in crystalline states. The weight ratio of nitrogen in LiN5 is nearly 91%, placing LiN5 as a promising high-energy material. The decomposition of LiN5 is expected to be highly exothermic, releasing an energy of approximately 2.72 kJ\u00b7g\u20131. The present results open a new avenue to synthesize polynitrogen compounds and provide a key perspective toward the understanding of novel chemical bonding in nitrogen-rich compounds.", "Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 was synthesized by hydrothermal method using diethylenetriamine as complexing agent (Chem.Mater.2008, 20, 7268). Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 being the only compound likes UO2+\u03b4 to have excess oxygen, it releases a large proportion of its lattice oxygen (0.167 M [O]/mole of compound) at relatively low temperature (465 \u00b0C) directly and it has been utilized for generation of H2 by thermo-splitting of water. An almost stoichiometric amount of H2 (0.152 M/Mole of compound) is generated at much lower temperature (65 \u00b0C). There is an almost comparable amount of oxygen release and hydrogen generation over this material at very low temperature compared to other CeO2\u2212MOx (Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni) mixed-oxide solid solutions (O2 evolution \u22651300 \u00b0C and H2 generation at 1000 \u00b0C). The reversible nature of oxygen release and intake of this material is attributed to its fluorite structure and coupling between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/6+/Cr3+ redox couples. Compound shows reversible oxygen release and intake by H2O absorption and subsequent hydrogen release to gain parent structure and hence this material can be utilized for generation of H2 at very low temperature by thermo-chemical splitting of water.", "We have developed a simple method to fabricate a gradient from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity. It is based on the controlled self-assembled monolayer consisting of a thiol molecule on a gold surface and the amplifying effect of the wetting property on a rough surface. Using a relatively dilute HS(CH2)11CH3 solution (0.05 mmol/L), we found that the density of molecules on the surface can be controlled by varying the immersion time. Slowly adding the dilute solution to the container holding the rough gold substrate will lead to a density gradient along the surface. After the complementary adsorption of HS(CH2)10CH2OH, the surface exhibits a gradient from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity. The slope of the gradient can be conveniently tuned by varying the speed of addition. Cassie\u2212Baxter and Wenzel equations are employed to explain this special property based on the rough structure and the molecular composition gradient that have been determined by XPS. This kind of material would provide a larger oriented driving force for many important biological and physical processes and might have potential applications in water droplet movement, oriented axonal specification of neurons, protein adhesion, and so on.", "Supporting faculty with professional development resources at all career stages is vital to the success of faculty members, their students, and academic institutions.

However, new properties and new functionalities emerge by looking at the interface between layers in heterostructures of 2D materials. Here, we demonstrate the integration of 2D heterostructures as tunable nano-electromechanical systems, exploring the competition between the mechanics of the ultrathin membrane and the incommensurate van der Waals interface. We fabricate electrically contacted 5 or 6 \u03bcm circular drumheads of suspended heterostructure membranes of monolayer graphene on monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which we call a 2D bimorph. We characterize the mechanical resonance through electrostatic actuation and laser interferometry detection. The 2D bimorphs have resonance frequencies of 5\u201320 MHz and quality factors of 50\u2013700, comparable to resonators from monolayer or few-layer 2D materials. The frequencies and eigenmode shapes of the higher harmonics display split degenerate modes, showing that the 2D bimorphs behave as membranes with asymmetric tension. The devices display dynamic ranges of 44 dB, with an additional nonlinearity in the dissipation at small drive. Under electrostatic frequency tuning, devices display a small tuning of \u223c20% compared with graphene resonators, which have >100%. In addition, the tuning shows a kink that deviates from the tensioned membrane model for atomic membranes and corresponds with a changing in stress of 14 mN/m. A model that accounts for this tuning behavior is the onset of interlayer slip in the heterostructure, allowing the tension in the membrane to relax. Using density functional theory simulations, we find that the change in stress at the kink is much larger than the predicted energy barrier for interlayer slip of 0.102 mN/m in an incommensurate 2D heterostructure but smaller than the energy barrier for an aligned graphene bilayer of 35 mN/m, suggesting a local pinning effect at ripples or folds in the heterostructure. Finally, we observe an asymmetry in tuning of the full width at half-maximum that does not exist in monolayer resonators. These findings demonstrate a new class of nano-electromechanical systems from 2D heterostructures and unravel the complex interaction of membrane morphology versus interlayer adhesion and slip on the mechanics of incommensurate van der Waals interfaces.", "METALLIC SINGLE-WALLED carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can be selectively etched and eliminated from a substrate without damaging their semiconducting SWNT neighbors, thanks to a finely tuned methane plasma reaction ( Science2006 , 314 , 974). The process, developed by scientists at Stanford University, is getting attention from chip makers for its potential in manufacturing nanotube-based electronics\nTo date, all SWNT syntheses inevitably produce a mixture of both semiconducting and metallic nanotubes, which differ in their architecture and properties. This mix has been the primary roadblock to using SWNTs in high-performance electronic devices. Metallic SWNTs will short-circuit electrical devices, and so far, there's no simple way to separate the different types of tubes.\nHongjie Dai and coworkers report that a gas-phase methane plasma reaction selectively adds hydrogen and methyl groups to metallic nanotubes, which are slightly more reactive than semiconducting nanotubes.

The photocatalytic Rhodamine B degradation property and the photoelectrochemical performance of the graphene\u2013ZnO quasi-shell\u2013core composite are dependent on the amount of graphene oxide that is added. When the amount of graphene oxide added is 10 mg, the graphene\u2013ZnO quasi-shell\u2013core composite possesses the optimal photocatalytic degradation efficiency and the best photoelectrochemical performance. An efficient interfacial electric field is established on the interface between the graphene and ZnO, which significantly improves the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs and thus dramatically increases its photoelectrochemical performance. In addition to the excellent photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties, the electron migration ability of the grephene\u2013ZnO quasi-shell\u2013core composite is significantly enhanced due to the graphene coating on ZnO surface; therefore, this material has great potential for application as a substrate material to accept electrons in dye solar cell and in narrow bandgap semiconductor quantum dot sensitized solar cells.", "Developing multifunctional superwettable materials is highly demanded in the oil/water separation field but remains challenging due to the critical limitations of complex fabrication strategy and high cost. Herein, based on the cost-effective kaolin nanoparticles, we present a convenient and mild strategy for fabricating a smart superwettable material with multiple excellent performances, such as pH-responsive water wettability, self-cleaning property, favorable buoyancy, and air purification performance. By virtue of the dual rough surface structure and special chemical composition, the resultant material surface exhibits a superior pH-dependent wettability, which can be reversibly switched between superamphiphobicity and superhydrophilicity\u2013superoleophobicity for many times in accordance with the pH value of the corresponding aqueous solution. As a result, the obtained superwettable material with reversible and controllable water wettability can be applied in efficient and continuous separation of multiple types of oil/water mixtures, especially the highly emulsified oil/water emulsions, via in situ or ex situ wettability change. To our knowledge, the smart material with the wetting property of superamphiphobicity that can be used for continuous emulsified wastewater purification has been rarely discussed in the emerging research works. In addition, the as-prepared material presents universal applicability to diversiform substrates and exhibits robust durability and stability against high-concentration salt solutions and rigorous mechanical abrasion. All of these above-mentioned advantages indicate that the as-prepared superwettable material will hold great potential in various practical applications, including oily wastewater remediation, smart aquatic device fabrication, liquid droplet manipulation, guiding liquid movement, and optimizing multiple operations in industrial fields.", "The benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxyamide containing three l-methionine (1) self-assemble through 3-fold amide\u2013amide hydrogen bonds and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking to fabricate one-dimensional nanorod like structure.

The DSC exothermic peak of the charged electrode LiNi0.74Co0.26-xMgxO2 (when x = 0.04 or higher) was significantly smaller than that of LiNi0.74Co0.26O2, indicating that the Mg substitution improved its thermal stability. The improvements of both the electrochemical and thermal stability are possibly due to the reduced cation mixing and improvement of layer structure by the expansion of the c-axis.", "Polymer science has long been underrepresented in the traditional chemical engineering and (industrial) chemistry curricula, although it is an integral part of the professional practice of most chemistry and chemical engineering graduates. The present contribution details a modular implementation of four polymer science courses of varying difficulty and content tailored for students from engineering as well as chemistry backgrounds. The courses seek to fuse traditional elements of polymer chemistry and physics with emerging cutting-edge technologies at the nexus of organic and polymer chemistry. We demonstrate that a challenging and effective curriculum can be constructed and embedded in a teaching approach composed of interactive lectures and tutorials, engaging laboratory exercises, and literature work incorporating elements of cutting-edge research.

The performance of such DNA-modified particles is greatly dependent on the degree of surface coverage, but existing methods for quantitation can only be employed for certain particle compositions and/or conjugation chemistries. We have developed a simple and broadly applicable exonuclease III (Exo III) digestion assay based on the cleavage of phosphodiester bonds\u2014a universal feature of DNA-modified particles\u2014to accurately quantify DNA probe surface coverage on diverse, commonly used particles of different compositions, conjugation chemistries, and sizes. Our assay utilizes particle-conjugated, fluorophore-labeled probes that incorporate two abasic sites; these probes are hybridized to a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand, and quantitation is achieved via cleavage and digestion of surface-bound probe DNA via Exo III\u2019s apurinic endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities. The presence of the two abasic sites in the probe greatly speeds up the enzymatic reaction without altering the packing density of the probes on the particles. Probe digestion releases a signal-generating fluorophore and liberates the intact cDNA strand to start a new cycle of hybridization and digestion, until all fluorophore tags have been released. Since the molar ratio of fluorophore to immobilized DNA is 1:1, DNA surface coverage can be determined accurately based on the complete release of fluorophores. Our method delivers accurate, rapid, and reproducible quantitation of thiolated DNA on the surface of gold nanoparticles, and also performs equally well with other conjugation chemistries, substrates, and particle sizes, and thus offers a broadly useful assay for quantitation of DNA surface coverage.", "The electronic structure of 2D semiconductors depends on their thickness, providing new opportunities to engineer semiconductors for energy conversion, electronics, and catalysis. Here we show how a 3D semiconductor, black phosphorus, becomes active for solar-to-chemical energy conversion when it is thinned to a 2D material. The increase in its band gap, from 0.3 eV (3D) to 2.1 eV (2D monolayer), is accompanied by a 40-fold enhancement in the formation of chemical products. Despite this enhancement, smaller flakes also have shorter excited state lifetimes. We deduce a mechanism in which recombination occurs at flake edges, while the \u201cvan der Waals\u201d surface of black phosphorus bonds to chemical intermediates and facilitates electron transfer. The unique properties of black phosphorus highlight its potential as a customizable material for solar energy conversion and catalysis, while also allowing us to identify design rules for 2D photocatalysts that will enable further improvements in these materials.", "Polymeric rubber-elastic material (REM) is in many ways analogous to ideal gases.

The detail characterizations of frontier electronic structure and lowest-energy optical transitions have been studied by means of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). Five BCP analogues, o-phenanthroline (1), 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (2), 2,9-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (3), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (4), and 2,9-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1,10-phenanthroline (5) have also been studied in order to select more suitable candidates of efficient hole-blocking materials. The calculated results showed that rigid planar structures, conjugate degrees, and substitute groups play crucial roles in the hole/exciton-blocking and electron-transport properties of these materials. The calculated geometries, ionization energies (IP), and energy gap between the singlet ground state and triplet excited state (ET1) were well in agreement with the experimental results. On the basis of the incoherent transport model, the calculated electron mobility of BCP is 1.79 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm2/(V s), which is comparable to experimental results of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2/(V s).

The diffusion coefficient of SVOCs in clothing material (Dm) is essential for estimating SVOC sorption by clothing material and subsequent dermal exposure to SVOCs. However, few studies have reported the measured Dm for clothing materials. In this paper, we present the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) based Ca-history method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first try to measure Dm with known relative standard deviation (RSD). A thin sealed chamber is formed by a circular ring and two pieces of flat SVOC source materials that are tightly covered by the targeted clothing materials. Dm is obtained by applying an SVOC mass transfer model in the chamber to the history of gas-phase SVOC concentrations (Ca) in the chamber measured by SPME.

A commensurate modulation that doubles the periodicity of the lattice in the a-axis direction is observed. When the structure of LiFeBO3 is refined in the 4-dimensional superspace group C2/c(\u03b10\u03b3)00, with \u03b1 = 1/2 and \u03b3 = 0 and with lattice parameters of a = 5.1681 \u00c5, b = 8.8687 \u00c5, c = 10.1656 \u00c5, and \u03b2 = 91.514\u00b0, all of the disorder present in the prior C2/c structural model is eliminated and a long-range ordering of 1D chains of corner-shared LiO4 is revealed to occur as a result of cooperative displacements of Li and O atoms in the c-axis direction. Solid-state hybrid density functional theory calculations find that the modulation stabilizes the LiFeBO3 structure by 1.2 kJ/mol (12 meV/f.u.), and that the modulation disappears after delithiation to form a structurally related FeBO3 phase. The band gaps of LiFeBO3 and FeBO3 are calculated to be 3.5 and 3.3 eV, respectively.

The attachment of alkyl groups to the surface, the structure of the bonded layer, and changes in the mesoporous structure of the FSM-16 material upon functionalization were studied by means of high-resolution thermogravimetry, elemental analysis, nitrogen adsorption, and 13C and 29Si NMR. Surface coverages of attached ligands were in the range of 0.85\u22122.60 mmol/g. All modified samples showed a decrease in the pore size, which was in relation to the size of attached ligands. The uniformity of pores upon modification proves that the mesoporous structure of FSM-16 is retained after modification. The attachment of ligands takes place in a solvent either with a small amount of water or anhydrous indicating a direct reaction between the chlorosilane molecule and silanol groups and/or a reaction autocatalyzed by the small amount of water present on the FSM-16 surface. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms and the adsorption energy distributions calculated from these isotherms revealed the presence of highly ordered alkyl ligands and the existence of the screening effect produced by alkyl groups as a result of weak interactions of nitrogen probe molecules with attached long alkyl chains. Thermal stability of modified samples greatly depends on the conformation of attached ligands. By using appropriate solvent and/or thermal treatment of modified samples, it was possible to achieve higher ordering of attached groups and consequently higher thermal stability of the resulting bonded phases. The studies of silicon spin\u2212lattice relaxation times T1 support the formation of ligand structures on the surface and show that the surface accessibility greatly decreases with increasing length of attached ligands and with refinement of the ordering of ligands on the surface.

The goal of this research project is to discover Singaporean student misconceptions involving laboratory science theories using a Laboratory Concept Questionnaire and discover how students are forming these misconceptions.", "The promising complex structures of graphene nanocapsules with in situ formed graphene sheets (GC-Gs) have been generated by partially peeling the multiwalled graphene capsules (MWGCs) with a small size of ca. 15 nm. The abundant edges and defects on the in situ induced graphene sheets and capsule walls largely favored the lithiation/delithiation reaction and resulted in a high Li-ion storage level. Since the surface area loss of GC-Gs during stacking and aggregation is generally avoided due to the branched structures and the active doping atoms (N, S) can be intercalated into the carbon lattices during sample preparation, the unique GC-Gs possess an excellent reversible capacity of 1373 mAh g\u20131 at 0.5 A g\u20131 as anode material in lithium-ion batteries. This value is more than 3 times that of the theoretical capacity of state-of-the-art graphite counterpart, and higher than those of most carbon materials reported to date and even the composites of metal, alloys with carbon materials.", "Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 was synthesized by hydrothermal method using diethylenetriamine as complexing agent (Chem.Mater.2008, 20, 7268). Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 being the only compound likes UO2+\u03b4 to have excess oxygen, it releases a large proportion of its lattice oxygen (0.167 M [O]/mole of compound) at relatively low temperature (465 \u00b0C) directly and it has been utilized for generation of H2 by thermo-splitting of water. An almost stoichiometric amount of H2 (0.152 M/Mole of compound) is generated at much lower temperature (65 \u00b0C). There is an almost comparable amount of oxygen release and hydrogen generation over this material at very low temperature compared to other CeO2\u2212MOx (Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni) mixed-oxide solid solutions (O2 evolution \u22651300 \u00b0C and H2 generation at 1000 \u00b0C). The reversible nature of oxygen release and intake of this material is attributed to its fluorite structure and coupling between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Cr4+/6+/Cr3+ redox couples. Compound shows reversible oxygen release and intake by H2O absorption and subsequent hydrogen release to gain parent structure and hence this material can be utilized for generation of H2 at very low temperature by thermo-chemical splitting of water.", "Supporting faculty with professional development resources at all career stages is vital to the success of faculty members, their students, and academic institutions. In science and engineering fields where women are underrepresented, practices that promote career advancement, such as formal and informal mentoring programs, can be effective in both increasing the visibility and numbers of senior women and also encouraging female students to pursue technical majors and careers. A symposium at the March 2010 National Meeting of the American Chemical Society will feature an array of successful mechanisms for enhancing the leadership, visibility, and recognition of women faculty members using various mentoring strategies.", "Highly crystalline semimetallic 1T\u2032 WTe2 nanorods (WTe2 NRs) and WTe2 nanoflowers (WTe2 NFs) are applied as anode materials for the sodium ion battery (SIB) for the first time. WTe2 NRs and NFs are synthesized through a novel two-step process with hydrothermal-derived WO3 transformed into WTe2 NRs and NFs after a chemical vapor deposition process. The performance of the WTe2 SIB anode is highly influenced by WTe2 morphology. WTe2 NRs have shown high capacity in sodium ion storage, with an excellent rate and cycling stability. The initial discharge capacity for WTe2 NRs is 442 mA h g\u20131 at the current density of 0.1 A g\u20131 and remains at 221 mA h g\u20131 after 100 cycles, while WTe2 NFs show 324 mA h g\u20131 initial capacity and remain at 260 mA h g\u20131 after 40 cycles. The Coulombic efficiencies of both WTe2 NR and NF anodes are as high as 98.83 and 97.96% from the second cycle, respectively.", "Atomic membranes of monolayer 2D materials represent the ultimate limit in the size of nano-electromechanical systems. However, new properties and new functionalities emerge by looking at the interface between layers in heterostructures of 2D materials. Here, we demonstrate the integration of 2D heterostructures as tunable nano-electromechanical systems, exploring the competition between the mechanics of the ultrathin membrane and the incommensurate van der Waals interface. We fabricate electrically contacted 5 or 6 \u03bcm circular drumheads of suspended heterostructure membranes of monolayer graphene on monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which we call a 2D bimorph. We characterize the mechanical resonance through electrostatic actuation and laser interferometry detection. The 2D bimorphs have resonance frequencies of 5\u201320 MHz and quality factors of 50\u2013700, comparable to resonators from monolayer or few-layer 2D materials. The frequencies and eigenmode shapes of the higher harmonics display split degenerate modes, showing that the 2D bimorphs behave as membranes with asymmetric tension. The devices display dynamic ranges of 44 dB, with an additional nonlinearity in the dissipation at small drive. Under electrostatic frequency tuning, devices display a small tuning of \u223c20% compared with graphene resonators, which have >100%. In addition, the tuning shows a kink that deviates from the tensioned membrane model for atomic membranes and corresponds with a changing in stress of 14 mN/m. A model that accounts for this tuning behavior is the onset of interlayer slip in the heterostructure, allowing the tension in the membrane to relax. Using density functional theory simulations, we find that the change in stress at the kink is much larger than the predicted energy barrier for interlayer slip of 0.102 mN/m in an incommensurate 2D heterostructure but smaller than the energy barrier for an aligned graphene bilayer of 35 mN/m, suggesting a local pinning effect at ripples or folds in the heterostructure. Finally, we observe an asymmetry in tuning of the full width at half-maximum that does not exist in monolayer resonators. These findings demonstrate a new class of nano-electromechanical systems from 2D heterostructures and unravel the complex interaction of membrane morphology versus interlayer adhesion and slip on the mechanics of incommensurate van der Waals interfaces.", "Polyanion compounds have relatively low energy density compared to plain oxides as cathode materials. We for the first time report on a Li-rich fluorophosphate compound, Li5V2PO4F8, that can have high energy density originating from both the multielectron reaction of vanadium and high voltage induced by a fluorine. The developed material has a new crystal structure that has a robust three-dimensional framework of corner-sharing octahedra VO2F4 with tetrahedra PO4 and three-dimensional lithium ion diffusion pathways, which can facilitate the (de)intercalation of lithium ions. Its theoretical capacity is 285 mAh/g when two electrons are exploited. Practically, it shows the highest redox voltage, \u223c4.4 V (vs Li/Li+), among V3+/V4+ redox reactions, with 111 mAh/g of reversible capacity. Only in the first charge does it show an active redox reaction of the V4+/V5+ at \u223c4.9 V (vs Li/Li+) with 228 mAh/g of charge capacity. Moreover, the vanadium-deficient phase shows stable capacity retention and good rate capability at both charging and discharging rates up to the 2C rate. The discovery of the lithium- and fluorine-rich phosphate compounds reported here introduces a new family of cathode materials, and further exploration and optimization can be expected to unlock the full potential of this family.", "The Yen\u2013Mullins model, also known as the modified Yen model, specifies the predominant molecular and colloidal structure of asphaltenes in crude oils and laboratory solvents and consists of the following: The most probable asphaltene molecular weight is \u223c750 g/mol, with the island molecular architecture dominant. At sufficient concentration, asphaltene molecules form nanoaggregates with an aggregation number less than 10. At higher concentrations, nanoaggregates form clusters again with small aggregation numbers. The Yen\u2013Mullins model is consistent with numerous molecular and colloidal studies employing a broad array of methodologies. Moreover, the Yen\u2013Mullins model provides a foundation for the development of the first asphaltene equation of state for predicting asphaltene gradients in oil reservoirs, the Flory\u2013Huggins\u2013Zuo equation of state (FHZ EoS). In turn, the FHZ EoS has proven applicability in oil reservoirs containing condensates, black oils, and heavy oils. While the development of the Yen\u2013Mullins model was founded on a very large number of studies, it nevertheless remains essential to validate consistency of this model with important new data streams in asphaltene science. In this paper, we review recent advances in asphaltene science that address all critical aspects of the Yen\u2013Mullins model, especially molecular architecture and characteristics of asphaltene nanoaggregates and clusters. Important new studies are shown to be consistent with the Yen\u2013Mullins model. Wide ranging studies with direct interrogation of the Yen\u2013Mullins model include detailed molecular decomposition analyses, optical measurements coupled with molecular orbital calculations, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, centrifugation, direct-current (DC) conductivity, interfacial studies, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), as well as oilfield studies. In all cases, the Yen\u2013Mullins model is proven to be at least consistent if not valid. In addition, several studies previously viewed as potentially inconsistent with the Yen\u2013Mullins model are now largely resolved. Moreover, oilfield studies using the Yen\u2013Mullins model in the FHZ EoS are greatly improving the understanding of many reservoir concerns, such as reservoir connectivity, heavy oil gradients, tar mat formation, and disequilibrium. The simple yet powerful advances codified in the Yen\u2013Mullins model especially with the FHZ EoS provide a framework for future studies in asphaltene science, petroleum science, and reservoir studies.", "The successful peeling of graphene heralded the era of van der Waals material (vdWM) electronics. However, photodetectors based on semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), formulated as MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se), often suffer either poor responsivity or long response time because of their high density of deep-level defect states (DLDSs). Alloy engineering, which can shift the DLDSs to shallow-level defect states, is proposed to be an efficient strategy to solve this problem. However, proof-of-concept is still lacking, which is probably because of the absence of a facile technology to grow high-quality alloyed TMDs. Here, we report the growth of large-scale and high-quality Mo0.5W0.5S2 alloy films via pulsed laser deposition (PLD). We demonstrate that the resulting Mo0.5W0.5S2 photodetector possesses a stable photoresponse from 370 to 1064 nm. The photocurrent exhibits positive dependence on both the source\u2013drain voltage and incident power density, providing good tunability for multifunctional photoelectrical applications. We also establish that, because of the suppression of DLDSs with alloy engineering, the Mo0.5W0.5S2 photodetector achieves a good responsivity of 5.8 A/W and a response time shorter than 150 ms. The working mechanism for the suppression of DLDSs in Mo0.5W0.5S2 is unveiled by qualitatively analyzing the alloying-dressed band structure. In conclusion, the excellent performance of the PLD-grown Mo0.5W0.5S2 photodetector may pave the way for next-generation photodetection. The approach shown here represents a fundamental and universal scenario for the development of alloyed TMDs.", "Orthorhombic iron tungstate (Fe2WO6), with a reported bandgap of \u223c1.5\u20131.7 eV, is a potentially attractive material as the top absorber in a tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) device. Few studies have been carried out on this material, and most of the important optical, electronic, and PEC properties are not yet known. We fabricated thin film Fe2WO6 photoanodes by spray pyrolysis and identified the performance limitations for PEC water oxidation. Poor charge separation is found to severely limit the photocurrent, which is caused by a large mismatch between the light penetration depth (\u223c300 nm) and carrier diffusion length (<10 nm) of the material. In addition, the conduction band of Fe2WO6 lies 0.65 V positive of the reversible hydrogen electrode potential, which means that a large external bias potential is required for water oxidation. On the basis of these observations, we critically discuss the suitability of Fe2WO6 as a novel photoelectrode material for photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic applications.", "Project to transform sophomore quantitative analysis into a course on modern analytical science, emulating the working environment of a modern commercial analytical laboratory.", "Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a promising technique that converts wet biomass into a coal-like material and has a wide application to the fields of energy, material science, and nanotechnology. HTC has been primarily used to treat a limited number of feedstocks, mainly lignocellulosic biomass such as wood. Recently, the HTC process has been utilized to treat high-moisture-containing complex waste streams, a mixture of lignocellulosic and nonlignocellulosic biomass, such as sewage and municipal waste. However, there is limited knowledge on the effectiveness of HTC on purely nonlignocellulosic industrial waste like seafood waste. Processing of seafood generates enormous amounts of waste in the form of solid residues and liquid effluents. Currently there is a demand for attractive seafood waste utilization strategies that minimize environmental pollution while recovering products that are of commercial interest to the industry. In this study, we have devised one such strategy where seafood waste is pretreated by enzymatic hydrolysis for subsequent HTC to produce hydrochar and biocrude liquor. Enzyme hydrolysis conditions including enzyme concentration, incubation time, and enzyme ratios were carefully optimized for maximal hydrolysis of seafood waste. By using an enzyme cocktail of Viscozyme, Lipase, and Protease, it was found that an enzyme ratio of 1:1:1 (w/w/w), and an enzyme concentration of 10\u201320% with a treatment time of 16 h, resulted in maximal hydrolysis of fish and shrimp waste. Subsequently, hydrochar and biocrude liquor were generated from hydrolyzed fish and shrimp waste by microwave hydrothermal carbonization (MHTC) using a high-pressure Mini WAVE Digestion Module (SCP Science, Canada) with quartz vessels at conditions of 150 \u00b0C for a 1 h reaction time. The results of this study show for the first time that MHTC can be successfully employed to produce valuable products from pure nonlignocellulosic waste like seafood waste. This would pave the way for effective utilization of other moisture-rich nonlignocellulosic industrial wastes.", "Many publications, patents and books now exist that deal with shape-selective zeolite catalysis.

As an efficient 1064 nm near-infrared (NIR) pulsed laser absorber, only 0.005 wt % (50 ppm) of graphene prepared by mechanical exfoliation endowed polymer materials with very good NIR pulsed laser patterning. Optical microscopy observed that the generated black patterns came from the local discoloration of the polymer surface subjected to the laser irradiation, and the depth of the discolored layer was determined to be within 221\u2013348 \u03bcm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the polymer surface discoloration was contributed by the local carbonization of polymers caused by graphene due to its high photothermal conversion capacity. Raman depth imaging successfully detected that the generated carbon in the discolored layer was composed of amorphous carbon and complex sp/sp2-carbon compounds containing C\u2261C or conjugated C\u2550C/C\u2261C structures. This study also provides a simple guideline to fabricate laser-patterning polymer materials based on graphene. We believe that graphene has broad application prospects in the field of polymer laser patterning. Importantly, this work opens up a valuable, feasible direction for the practical application of this new carbon material.", 0, "Dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) is a frequently used method to assess past, present, and future stocks and flows of metals in the anthroposphere.

The performance of such DNA-modified particles is greatly dependent on the degree of surface coverage, but existing methods for quantitation can only be employed for certain particle compositions and/or conjugation chemistries. We have developed a simple and broadly applicable exonuclease III (Exo III) digestion assay based on the cleavage of phosphodiester bonds\u2014a universal feature of DNA-modified particles\u2014to accurately quantify DNA probe surface coverage on diverse, commonly used particles of different compositions, conjugation chemistries, and sizes. Our assay utilizes particle-conjugated, fluorophore-labeled probes that incorporate two abasic sites; these probes are hybridized to a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand, and quantitation is achieved via cleavage and digestion of surface-bound probe DNA via Exo III\u2019s apurinic endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities. The presence of the two abasic sites in the probe greatly speeds up the enzymatic reaction without altering the packing density of the probes on the particles. Probe digestion releases a signal-generating fluorophore and liberates the intact cDNA strand to start a new cycle of hybridization and digestion, until all fluorophore tags have been released. Since the molar ratio of fluorophore to immobilized DNA is 1:1, DNA surface coverage can be determined accurately based on the complete release of fluorophores. Our method delivers accurate, rapid, and reproducible quantitation of thiolated DNA on the surface of gold nanoparticles, and also performs equally well with other conjugation chemistries, substrates, and particle sizes, and thus offers a broadly useful assay for quantitation of DNA surface coverage.", "Dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) is a frequently used method to assess past, present, and future stocks and flows of metals in the anthroposphere.

This technology requires separate sensors, processors, communications networks and response actuators. However, we are now poised for a revolution in the design of these structures based on our ability to design and construct systems capable of improved intrasystem communications. This will enable us to design systems with more effective internal communications, obliterating the need for external intervention.

It is worth mentioning that the hydrogen bond network by the guest/coordinated waters, dicarboxylic, as well as sulfonic acid group(s) are present in the interlayer spaces, which are basically responsible for showing this high degree of proton conductivity in addition to significant water adsorption.

In particular, the global mass flow of primary and secondary CRT glass and the theoretical capacities for using secondary CRT glass to make new CRT glass are analyzed.

The comparison of the ratio of secondary glass collected to the amount of new glass required from the mass flow analysis indicates that the material recovery system is sustainable for the foreseeable future. However, a prediction of the time at which the market for secondary glass will collapse due to excess capacity is not possible at the moment due to several sources of uncertainty.", "A multiscale theoretical approach was used for the investigation of hydrogen storage in the recently synthesized carbon nanoscrolls. First, ab initio calculations at the density functional level of theory (DFT) were performed in order to (a) calculate the binding energy of H2 molecules at the walls of nanoscrolls and (b) fit the parameters of the interatomic potential used in Monte Carlo simulations. Second, classical Monte Carlo simulations were performed for estimating the H2 storage capacity of \u201cexperimental size\u201d nanoscrolls containing thousands of atoms. Our results show that pure carbon nanoscrolls cannot accumulate hydrogen because the interlayer distance is too small.

In the presence of a significant amount of physisorbed contaminants (water vapor, atmospheric gases, residual solvents, etc.), which was the case for ZSM-5, MIL-53, and F400, but not ZIF-8, the skeletal density tended to be overestimated in the low percent volume region. In addition, the kinetic data (i.e., skeletal density vs measurement cycle) reveals distinctive traits for a properly activated vs a nonactivated sample for all examined samples: activated samples with a significant amount of mass loss show a curved down plot that eventually reaches the equilibrium value, whereas nonactivated, nonporous, or extremely hydrophobic samples exhibit a flat line. This work illustrates how helium pycnometry can provide information about the structure of a material, and that, conversely, when  the structure of the material and its percent mass loss after activation (amount of physisorbed contaminants) are known, the behavior of activated and nonactivated samples in terms of skeletal density, percent fill volume, and measurement cycle can be predicted.", "Project to transform sophomore quantitative analysis into a course on modern analytical science, emulating the working environment of a modern commercial analytical laboratory.", "A new type of electrochemically driven actuator is described. This actuator uses graphitic carbon as the electroactive material (as opposed to the polymeric films used in previous devices of this type), and it is the first example of an actuator based on a nanostructured material. The actuator consists of branched carbon nanotubules embedded within the pores of a microporous alumina template membrane. Electrochemical Li+ intercalation causes this nanotubule-containing membrane to flex, and electrochemical deintercalation causes the membrane to relax to its original position. The characteristics of this new actuator are described here.", "The 3D polymeric terephthalate of scandium has been synthesized and its structure solved by single-crystal XRD. It was obtained as a single phase and characterized and tested as a hydrogen and nitrogen adsorbent and heterogeneous catalyst as a redox agent in the oxidation of sulfides.

The high chemical and thermal stability and excellent hydrogen sorption properties make this compound a useful material for hydrogen storage.", "Nanozerovalent iron (nZVI) is widely used for its ability to remove or degrade environmental contaminants. However, the effect of nZVI-pollutant complexes on organisms has not been tested. We demonstrate the ability of a sulfidized derivative of nZVI (FeSSi) to sorb cadmium (Cd) from aqueous media and alleviate Cd toxicity to a freshwater alga for 32 days. FeSSi particles removed over 80% of the aqueous Cd in the first hour and nearly the same concentration of free Cd remained unbound at the end of the experiment. We found that FeSSi particles with Cd sorbed onto them are an order of magnitude more toxic than FeSSi alone. Further, algal-produced organic material facilitates safer remediation of Cd by FeSSi by decreasing the toxicity of FeSSi itself. We developed a dynamic model to predict the maximum Cd concentration FeSSi can remediate without replacing Cd toxicity with its own. FeSSi can remediate four times as much Cd to phytoplankton populations when organic material is present compared to the absence of organic material. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FeSSi as an environmental remediator and the strength of our quantitative model of the mitigation of nanoparticle toxicity by algal-produced organic material.", "Many publications, patents and books now exist that deal with shape-selective zeolite catalysis. This is an account of the adventure of its evolution. It recalls the basic interests that drove the exploration, the steps taken and the bridges crossed on the pathways from science to technology. It will also remind us of human and social elements that interplay, as always, in the evolution of any major technological innovation. This historical review serves furthermore to remind us of basic scientific elements that became recognized or evolved. It may stimulate thoughts toward more science and other technologies that may be sprung from these roots.", "Lateral heterojunctions in two-dimensional (2D) materials have demonstrated potential for high-performance sensors because of the unique electrostatic conditions at the interface. The increased complexity of producing such structures, however, has prevented their widespread use. We here demonstrate the simple and scalable fabrication of heterojunctions by a one-step synthesis process that yields photodetectors with superior device performance. Catalytic conversion of a solid precursor at optimized conditions was found to produce lateral nanostructured junctions between graphene domains and 3 nm thin amorphous carbon films. Carrier transport in these heterojunctions was found to proceed by minimizing the path through the amorphous carbon barriers, which results in a self-selective Schottky emission process with high uniformity and low emission barriers. We demonstrate the potential of thus produced heterojunctions by realizing a photodetector that combines an ultrahigh detectivity of 1013 Jones with microsecond response time, which represents the highest performance of 2D material heterojunction devices. These attractive features are retained even for millimeter-scale devices, and the demonstrated ability to produce transparent, patterned, and flexible sensors extends lateral heterojunction sensors toward wearable and large-scale electronics.", 0, "The deficiency of nonlinear-optical (NLO) materials in the IR region inspires strong research interest in this field.

The detail characterizations of frontier electronic structure and lowest-energy optical transitions have been studied by means of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). Five BCP analogues, o-phenanthroline (1), 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (2), 2,9-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (3), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (4), and 2,9-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1,10-phenanthroline (5) have also been studied in order to select more suitable candidates of efficient hole-blocking materials. The calculated results showed that rigid planar structures, conjugate degrees, and substitute groups play crucial roles in the hole/exciton-blocking and electron-transport properties of these materials. The calculated geometries, ionization energies (IP), and energy gap between the singlet ground state and triplet excited state (ET1) were well in agreement with the experimental results. On the basis of the incoherent transport model, the calculated electron mobility of BCP is 1.79 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm2/(V s), which is comparable to experimental results of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2/(V s).

A new 2D material \u201cIlmenene\u201d has been exfoliated from the naturally occurring titanate ore ilmenite (FeTiO3) by employing liquid phase exfoliation in a dimethylformamide solvent by ultrasonic bath sonication. Ilmenene displays a [001] orientation that is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Probable charge transfer excitation from Fe2+Ti4+ to Fe3+Ti3+ results in ferromagnetic ordering along with the antiferromagnetic phase accompanied by enhanced anisotropy due to surface spins.

In the grape berry, skin PAs accounted for 54% of the total extractable PA, while seed and flesh-derived PA accounted for 30% and 15% of the total, respectively. Following fermentation, 25% of the fruit PA was found in the wine, while 27% was found in the pericarp isolated from marc, and 48% was unaccounted for (either remaining in the seed or adsorbed to lees). To investigate the role that cell wall material (CWM) has on PA extraction during fermentation, CWM isolated from skin and flesh were combined with PA in model suspensions. In general, the affinity of flesh CWM for PA increased with increasing PA molecular mass (MM); however, this relationship was not observed for the interaction of skin CWM with skin PA. Subsequent experiments suggest that the differences in the interaction of flesh and skin CWM with PA of higher MM (>15000 g/mol) may be limited by the structure of the CWM. Observed variations in the composition between skin and flesh CWM may explain the differences in PA interaction at high MM. Among wine-derived PA, no higher MM material was detected, suggesting that, during vinification, higher MM PA are nonextractable and/or are removed from the wine by interaction with CWM.", "Five soaring Gothic arches, marking the entrance to the U.S. Pavilion at the Seattle World's Fair, symbolize the underlying theme of the largest science exhibit ever assembled-man's unending search for knowledge about himself and his surroundings.

Two applications exemplify the usefulness of such an ML-driven approach: we generate a 7200-atom structural model, hitherto inaccessible with DFT simulations, that affords new insight into the medium-range structural order and we create an ensemble of uncorrelated, smaller structures, for studies of their chemical bonding with statistical significance. Our work opens the way for new atomistic insights into the fascinating and chemically complex class of phase-change materials that are used in real nonvolatile memory devices.", "FLUID AND COMPLICATED.

This strategy has begun to be employed, for example, using framework solids like Prussian blue analogues or porous carbons derived from metal\u2013organic frameworks, but the cycling stability of an ordered, bottom-up synthesized, three-dimensional carbon framework toward magnesiation and demagnesiation in a shuttle-type battery remains unexplored. Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) are a class of ordered porous carbonaceous framework materials with numerous superlative properties relevant to electrochemical energy storage. Herein, we report that ZTCs can serve as high-power cathode materials for magnesium-ion hybrid capacitors (MHCs), exhibiting high specific capacities (e.g., 113 mA h g\u20131 after 100 cycles) with an average discharge voltage of 1.44 V and exceptional capacity retention (e.g., 76% after 200 cycles). ZTC-based MHCs meet or exceed the gravimetric energy densities of state-of-the-art batteries functioning on the Mg2+ shuttle, while simultaneously displaying far superior rate capabilities (e.g., 834 W kg\u20131 at 600 mA g\u20131).", "Spindle-like porous \u03b1-Fe2O3 was prepared from an iron-based metal organic framework (MOF) template.

Even when cycled at 10 C, comparable capacity of 424 mAh g\u20131 could be achieved.", "An effective short-term scheduling formulation must simultaneously deal with several problem difficulties commonly arising in batch processes operations. One of the key features to be considered is the representation of the material transfer operations between process stages. A nonzero time as well as certain conditions and resources are always required to move the material from one processing stage to the next one according to the specified product recipe. The transfer task consumes a period of time during which a proper synchronization of the equipment units supplying and receiving the material is enforced. Synchronization implies that during the execution of the transfer task, one unit will be supplying the material whereas the other one will be receiving it and consequently, no other task can be simultaneously performed in both units. Most of the existing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization approaches have traditionally dealt with the batch scheduling problem assuming zero transfer times, and consequently no synchronization, between consecutive processing stages. Simplification relying on negligible transfer times may work properly for the scheduling of multiproduct batch plants with similar product recipes; however, it is demonstrated in this work that ignoring the important role of transfer times may seriously compromise the feasibility of the scheduling whenever shared units and storage tanks, material recycles, or bidirectional flows of products are to be considered. To overcome the serious limitations of current MILP-based scheduling approaches, a general precedence-based framework accounting for nonzero transfer times is introduced. Also, two alternative methods that avoid generating unfeasible schedules are proposed and tested in different case studies.", "A new strut containing an imidazolium tetracarboxylic acid core has been successfully incorporated into a microporous material using paddlewheel-coordinated copper(II) ions as nodes.

Particulate and gaseous materials were measured before, during, and after 3D printing in an exposure chamber. One ABS and two PLA (PLA1 and PLA2) cartridges were tested three times. For online monitoring, a scanning mobility particle sizer, light scattering instrument, and total volatile organic compound (TVOC) monitor were employed and a polycarbonate filter and various adsorbent tubes were used for offline sampling. The particle concentration of 3D printing using ABS material was 33\u201338 times higher than when PLA materials were used. Most particles were nanosize (<100 nm) during ABS (96%) and PLA1 (98%) use, but only 12% were nanosize for PLA2. The emissions rates were 1.61 \u00d7 1010 ea/min and 1.67 \u00d7 1011 ea/g cartridge with the ABS cartridge and 4.27\u20134.89 \u00d7 108 ea/min and 3.77\u20133.91 \u00d7 109 ea/g cartridge with the PLA cartridge. TVOCs were also emitted when the ABS was used (GM; 155 ppb, GSD; 3.4), but not when the PLA cartridges were used. Our results suggest that more research and sophisticated control methods, including the use of less harmful materials, blocking emitted containments, and using filters or adsorbents, should be implemented.", "In presenting the current status of technological utilization of polymers, this author focuses on the thrust toward developing macromolecules that can compete with metals and ceramics in mechanical strength and thermal stability and others that have electrical and optical behavior similar to metals and glass.

We for the first time report on a Li-rich fluorophosphate compound, Li5V2PO4F8, that can have high energy density originating from both the multielectron reaction of vanadium and high voltage induced by a fluorine. The developed material has a new crystal structure that has a robust three-dimensional framework of corner-sharing octahedra VO2F4 with tetrahedra PO4 and three-dimensional lithium ion diffusion pathways, which can facilitate the (de)intercalation of lithium ions. Its theoretical capacity is 285 mAh/g when two electrons are exploited. Practically, it shows the highest redox voltage, \u223c4.4 V (vs Li/Li+), among V3+/V4+ redox reactions, with 111 mAh/g of reversible capacity. Only in the first charge does it show an active redox reaction of the V4+/V5+ at \u223c4.9 V (vs Li/Li+) with 228 mAh/g of charge capacity. Moreover, the vanadium-deficient phase shows stable capacity retention and good rate capability at both charging and discharging rates up to the 2C rate. The discovery of the lithium- and fluorine-rich phosphate compounds reported here introduces a new family of cathode materials, and further exploration and optimization can be expected to unlock the full potential of this family.", "In this work, the asphaltenes from natural Indonesia asphalt rocks were taken as raw materials for the preparation of micromesoporous enriched carbon material through pyrolysis (<500 \u00b0C) and KOH activation (<900 \u00b0C) processes. It is found that, during the pyrolysis process, the asphaltenes could be converted to noncondensable gas (36.02%), pyrolytic tar (26.57%), and residual char (37.44%). When the char was mixed together with KOH for heating, more carbons would be released due to the activation reaction, forming a carbon network. The optimal activation conditions were obtained at KOH/char ratio of 3:1 and 800 \u00b0C for 30 min. Results also show that almost all of the nitrogen atoms stay in the solid carbon during heating with little releasing to the gas or liquid products. The final obtained porous carbon materials are determined to possess a specific surface area of 1735 m2/g with rich micropores (\u223c2.0 nm). Instrumental characterizations show that there are abundant heteroatomic groups, including S\u2550O, \u2014OH, and \u2014N\u2550, on the activated carbon surface. Further tests by adsorption indicate that the adsorption of methylene blue on the porous carbon material is monolayer adsorption. The maximal adsorption capacity is determined to be at 556.00 mg/g, much higher than that of some commercial activated carbons. It is also indicated that the adsorption kinetics follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. These findings suggest that the asphaltene derived carbon material would be promising efficient adsorbents. It also sheds lights on the resourcilization of asphaltenes.", "Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) allows for nanoscale-resolved Infrared (IR) and Terahertz (THz) imaging, and thus has manifold applications ranging from materials to biosciences. However, a quantitatively accurate understanding of image contrast formation at materials boundaries, and thus spatial resolution is a surprisingly unexplored terrain. Here we introduce the read/write head of a commercial hard disk drive (HDD) as a most suitable test sample for fundamental studies, given its well-defined sharp material boundaries perpendicular to its ultrasmooth surface. We obtain unprecedented and unexpected insights into the s-SNOM image formation process, free of topography-induced contrasts that often mask and artificially modify the pure near-field optical contrast. Across metal-dielectric boundaries, we observe non-point-symmetric line profiles for both IR and THz illumination, which are fully corroborated by numerical simulations. We explain our findings by a sample-dependent confinement and screening of the near fields at the tip apex, which will be of crucial importance for an accurate understanding and proper interpretation of high-resolution s-SNOM images of nanocomposite materials. We also demonstrate that with ultrasharp tungsten tips the apparent width (resolution) of sharp material boundaries can be reduced to about 5 nm.", "Negative differential resistance/transconductance (NDR/NDT) has been attracting significant attention as a key functionality in the development of multivalued logic (MVL) systems that can overcome the limits of conventional binary logic devices. A high peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) and more than double-peak transfer characteristics are required to achieve a stable MVL operation. In this study, an organic NDR (ONDR) device with double-peak transfer characteristics and a high peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR; >102) is fabricated by utilizing an organic material platform for the development of a key element device for MVL applications. The organic NDT (ONDT) device is fabricated using a series connection of electron-dominant (P(NDI2OD-Se2)) and hole-dominant (P(DPP2DT-T2)) channel ambipolar organic field-effect transistors (AOFETs), and the NDR feature is achieved via correlated biasing of the ONDT device. The PVCR of the ONDT device can reach up to 13,000 via carrier transfer modulation of the AOFETs by varying the PMMA:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio of the mixed layer that is used as the top-gate dielectric of each AOFET. Further, ternary latch circuit operation is demonstrated using the developed ONDR device that stores three logic states with three distinct and controllable output states by adjusting the PMMA:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio of the dielectric layer.", "Environmental technologies depend on raw materials, some of which are subject to volatile costs and availability concerns. One way to address these concerns is through substitution, of which there are many types. An important form of substitution in the short term is adopting an alternative production process, yielding a material with the same functional properties with less material input. In effect, technology substitutes for material. This study elucidates the role increased and uncertain material costs play in inducing different substitution types in the short to medium term. Specifically, this paper uses an expert survey to determine the relative importance of eight specific industry responses taken by magnet and wind turbine manufacturers in response to the 2010/2011 rare-earth price spike through 2016. Statistical tests show adopting an existing production process for magnets was the most important response, followed by cost passthrough, using an alternate magnet grade in a redesigned generator system, and using alternate systems altogether. The paper also provides specific findings for the magnet and wind turbine industries with respect to each substitution type.", 0, "The integration of functions in materials in order to gain macroscopic effects in response to environmental changes is an ongoing challenge in material science. Here, functions on different hierarchical levels are sequentially linked to translate a pH-triggered conformational transition from the molecular to the macroscopic level to induce directed movements in hydrogels. When the pH is increased, lysine-rich peptide molecules change their conformation into a \u03b2-hairpin structure because of the reduced electrostatic repulsion among the deprotonated amino groups. Coupled to this conformation change is the capability of the \u03b2-hairpin motifs to subsequently assemble into aggregates acting as reversible cross-links, which are used as controlling units to fix a temporary macroscopic shape. A structural function implemented into the hydrogel by a microporous architecture-enabled nondisruptive deformation upon compression by buckling of pore walls and their elastic recovery. Coupled to this structural function is the capability of the porous material to enhance the diffusion of ions into the hydrogel and to keep the dimension of the macroscopic systems almost constant when the additional cross-links are formed or cleaved as it limits the dimensional change of the pore walls. Covalent cross-linking of the hydrogel into a polymer network acted as gear shift to ensure translation of the function on the molecular level to the macroscopic dimension. In this way, the information of a directed shape-shift can be programmed into the material by mechanical deformation and pH-dependent formation of temporary net points. The information could be read out by lowering the pH. The peptides reverted back into their original random coil conformation and the porous polymer network could recover from the previously applied elastic deformation. The level of multifunctionality of the hydrogels can be increased by implementation of additional orthogonal functions such as antimicrobicity by proper selection of multifunctional peptides, which could enable sophisticated biomedical devices.", "A soft porous material [Zn(L)2(OH)2]n\u00b7Guest (where L is 4-(1H-naphtho[2,3-d]imidazol-1-yl)benzoate, and Guest is water or methanol) exhibits the strongest ever observed negative area compressibility (NAC), an extremely rare property, as at hydrostatic pressure most materials shrink in all directions and few expand in one direction. This is the first NAC reported in metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), and its magnitude, clearly visible and by far the highest of all known materials, can be reversibly tuned by exchanging guests adsorbed from hydrostatic fluids. This counterintuitive strong NAC of [Zn(L)2(OH)2]n\u00b7Guest arises from the interplay of flexible [\u2212Zn\u2013O(H)\u2212]n helices with layers of [\u2212Zn\u2013L\u2212]4 quadrangular puckered rings comprising large channel voids. The compression of helices and flattening of puckered rings combine to give a giant piezo-mechanical response, applicable in ultrasensitive sensors and actuators. The extrinsic NAC response to different hydrostatic fluids is due to varied host\u2013guest interactions affecting the mechanical strain within the range permitted by exceptionally high flexibility of the framework.", 0, "An intervention program for teaching chemistry through history was developed to determine whether this instructional approach would promote conceptual problem-solving ability of secondary school students. Three chemistry teachers and five classes of 8th graders (N = 220) participated in this quasi-experimental study. The quantitative results of a conceptual problem-solving test revealed that the experimental group students outperformed their counterparts in both the control and the comparison groups. In addition, low achievers benefited more from this teaching strategy than high achievers. The qualitative results of interviews indicated that students have learned from the history of science to avoid alternative conceptions held by previous scientists.", "Using first-principles calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of a new layered hydrogen-bonded 2D material Fe3(PO4)2\u00b78H2O. Interestingly, unlike other common 2D materials, such as layered van der Waals 2D materials, the band gap of 2D Fe3(PO4)2\u00b78H2O-(010)-(1 \u00d7 1) is smaller than bulk Fe3(PO4)2\u00b78H2O, which does not obey the normal quantum confinement effect and can be attributed to the edge states and the hydrogen bonds between the layers. We also find that the band-gap variation with the reduced layers depends on the length of the interlayer hydrogen bond and the stronger interlayer hydrogen bond leads to the larger band gap.", "In this paper, porous alumina was used as an alternative bed material to reduce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and improve the combustion efficiency during sewage sludge combustion in a fluidized bed combustor (FBC). To discover the reduction mechanism, the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area, critical fluidized velocity, and heat-transfer coefficient of three bed materials (silica sand, alumina sand, and porous alumina sand) were characterized. In comparison to the conventional silica bed material, the reduction efficiencies of PAH emission and PAH total toxic equivalent (TEQ) by porous alumina bed material under 850 \u00b0C were 52.0 and 97.7%, respectively. Porous alumina bed material had more BET surface area than that of the conventional silica sand, which could adsorb gaseous hydrocarbon and prolong the residence time of hydrocarbon in the diluted zone of the FBC. At the same time, it was well-known that gaseous hydrocarbons were a precursor of PAHs. Thus, PAH formation was suppressed. Moreover, the low heat-transfer coefficient would decrease the heat transmission rate between the bed materials and sewage sludge, which caused the sewage sludge decomposition rate in porous alumina bed material to be lower than that of silica bed material. Hence, less gaseous hydrocarbons and PAHs were formed. In addition, alumina bed material may inhibit agglomeration and enhance the fluidization quality of a fluidized bed incinerator. The above mechanism may account for reducing PAH formation by porous alumina bed material.", "Lateral heterojunctions in two-dimensional (2D) materials have demonstrated potential for high-performance sensors because of the unique electrostatic conditions at the interface. The increased complexity of producing such structures, however, has prevented their widespread use. We here demonstrate the simple and scalable fabrication of heterojunctions by a one-step synthesis process that yields photodetectors with superior device performance. Catalytic conversion of a solid precursor at optimized conditions was found to produce lateral nanostructured junctions between graphene domains and 3 nm thin amorphous carbon films. Carrier transport in these heterojunctions was found to proceed by minimizing the path through the amorphous carbon barriers, which results in a self-selective Schottky emission process with high uniformity and low emission barriers. We demonstrate the potential of thus produced heterojunctions by realizing a photodetector that combines an ultrahigh detectivity of 1013 Jones with microsecond response time, which represents the highest performance of 2D material heterojunction devices. These attractive features are retained even for millimeter-scale devices, and the demonstrated ability to produce transparent, patterned, and flexible sensors extends lateral heterojunction sensors toward wearable and large-scale electronics.", "A non-science majors' chemistry course that satisfies both instructors and students has been a long and difficult quest.

However, photodetectors based on semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), formulated as MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se), often suffer either poor responsivity or long response time because of their high density of deep-level defect states (DLDSs). Alloy engineering, which can shift the DLDSs to shallow-level defect states, is proposed to be an efficient strategy to solve this problem. However, proof-of-concept is still lacking, which is probably because of the absence of a facile technology to grow high-quality alloyed TMDs. Here, we report the growth of large-scale and high-quality Mo0.5W0.5S2 alloy films via pulsed laser deposition (PLD). We demonstrate that the resulting Mo0.5W0.5S2 photodetector possesses a stable photoresponse from 370 to 1064 nm. The photocurrent exhibits positive dependence on both the source\u2013drain voltage and incident power density, providing good tunability for multifunctional photoelectrical applications. We also establish that, because of the suppression of DLDSs with alloy engineering, the Mo0.5W0.5S2 photodetector achieves a good responsivity of 5.8 A/W and a response time shorter than 150 ms. The working mechanism for the suppression of DLDSs in Mo0.5W0.5S2 is unveiled by qualitatively analyzing the alloying-dressed band structure. In conclusion, the excellent performance of the PLD-grown Mo0.5W0.5S2 photodetector may pave the way for next-generation photodetection. The approach shown here represents a fundamental and universal scenario for the development of alloyed TMDs.", "Understanding the charge generation dynamics in organic photovoltaic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends is important for providing the necessary guidelines to improve overall device efficiency. Despite more than 15 years of experimental and theoretical studies, a universal picture describing the generation and recombination processes operating in organic photovoltaic devices is still being forged. We report here the results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy measurements of charge photogeneration and recombination processes in a high-performing solution-processed molecular BHJ. For comparison, we also studied a high-performing polymer-based BHJ material. We find that the majority of charge carriers in both systems are generated on <100 fs time scales and posit that excited state delocalization is responsible for the ultrafast charge transfer. This initial delocalization is consistent with the fundamental uncertainty associated with the photon absorption process (in the visible, \u03bb/4\u03c0 > 30 nm) and is comparable with the phase-separated domain size. In addition, exciton diffusion to charge-separating heterojunctions is observed at longer times (1\u2013500 ps). Finally, charge generation in pure films of the solution processed molecule was studied. Polarization anisotropy measurements clearly demonstrate that the optical properties are dominated by molecular (Frenkel) exictons and delocalized charges are promptly produced (t < 100 fs).", 0, "Cathedrals of Science is a selective history of the development of physical chemistry from 1880 to 1950 focusing on several major figures and their personal rivalries.", "The phase-change material, Ge2Sb2Te5, is the canonical material ingredient for next-generation storage-class memory devices used in novel computing architectures, but fundamental questions remain regarding its atomic structure and physicochemical properties.

The material consists of nanotubes with diameter of 10\u201315 nm and lengths of several hundred nanometers. The electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. The data imply a first cycle irreversible capacity of 385 mAh/g, and capacities of 307 and 265 mAh/g after the second and 50th cycle, respectively, at C/10.

The two kinds of arsenene are both indirect band gap semiconductors possessing moderate to high charge carrier mobilities falling in the range 40\u2013800 cm2 V\u20131 s\u20131. The puckered arsenene exhibits relatively low and anisotropic lattice thermal conductivities, with 9.6 W m\u20131 K\u20131 in the armchair and 30.7 W m\u20131 K\u20131 in the zigzag direction.

We go on to establish the optoelectronic potential of this material by demonstrating efficient photoemission and detection at 1.0 eV, an energy which is significant to the fields of both photovoltaics and optical telecommunications. Through dynamical spectroscopy this superior performance is found to arise from a low rate of surface recombination combined with a high rate of radiative recombination.

Interestingly, unlike other common 2D materials, such as layered van der Waals 2D materials, the band gap of 2D Fe3(PO4)2\u00b78H2O-(010)-(1 \u00d7 1) is smaller than bulk Fe3(PO4)2\u00b78H2O, which does not obey the normal quantum confinement effect and can be attributed to the edge states and the hydrogen bonds between the layers. We also find that the band-gap variation with the reduced layers depends on the length of the interlayer hydrogen bond and the stronger interlayer hydrogen bond leads to the larger band gap.", "Negative differential resistance/transconductance (NDR/NDT) has been attracting significant attention as a key functionality in the development of multivalued logic (MVL) systems that can overcome the limits of conventional binary logic devices. A high peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) and more than double-peak transfer characteristics are required to achieve a stable MVL operation. In this study, an organic NDR (ONDR) device with double-peak transfer characteristics and a high peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR; >102) is fabricated by utilizing an organic material platform for the development of a key element device for MVL applications. The organic NDT (ONDT) device is fabricated using a series connection of electron-dominant (P(NDI2OD-Se2)) and hole-dominant (P(DPP2DT-T2)) channel ambipolar organic field-effect transistors (AOFETs), and the NDR feature is achieved via correlated biasing of the ONDT device. The PVCR of the ONDT device can reach up to 13,000 via carrier transfer modulation of the AOFETs by varying the PMMA:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio of the mixed layer that is used as the top-gate dielectric of each AOFET.

We propose four scenarios for substitution of conventional steel with high-strength steel and aluminum at different rates over the period 2010\u20132050.

Annual savings can be up to 1 gigaton per year. After 2030, enhanced material recycling can lead to further reductions: closed-loop metal recycling in the automotive sector may reduce cumulative emissions by another 4\u20136 gigatons CO2-eq. The effectiveness of emissions mitigation by material substitution significantly depends on how the recycling system evolves.

One way to address these concerns is through substitution, of which there are many types. An important form of substitution in the short term is adopting an alternative production process, yielding a material with the same functional properties with less material input. In effect, technology substitutes for material. This study elucidates the role increased and uncertain material costs play in inducing different substitution types in the short to medium term. Specifically, this paper uses an expert survey to determine the relative importance of eight specific industry responses taken by magnet and wind turbine manufacturers in response to the 2010/2011 rare-earth price spike through 2016. Statistical tests show adopting an existing production process for magnets was the most important response, followed by cost passthrough, using an alternate magnet grade in a redesigned generator system, and using alternate systems altogether. The paper also provides specific findings for the magnet and wind turbine industries with respect to each substitution type.", "Conspectus\nNature utilizes large biomolecules to fulfill tasks that require spatially well-defined arrangements at the molecular level such as electron transfer, ligand\u2013receptor interactions, or catalysis. The creation of synthetic molecules that enable precise control over spacing and functionalization provides opportunities across diverse disciplines. Key requirements of functionalizable oligomeric scaffolds include the specific control of their molecular properties where the correct balance of flexibility and rigidity must be maintained in addition to the prerequisite of defined length. These molecules must ideally be equally applicable in aqueous and organic environments, they must be easy to synthesize in a controlled stepwise fashion, and they must be easily modified with a palette of chemical appendages having diverse functionalities.\nOligoproline, a peptidic polymer comprised of repeating units of the amino acid proline, is an ideal platform to meet such challenges. Oligoproline derives its characteristic rigidity and well-defined secondary structure from the innate features of proline. It is the only naturally occurring amino acid that has its side-chain cyclized to its \u03b1-amino group, generating often-populated trans and cis conformers around the tertiary amide bonds formed in proline oligomers. Oligoprolines are widely applied to define distance on the molecular level as they are capable of serving as both a \u201cmolecular ruler\u201d with a defined length and as a \u201cmolecular scaffold\u201d with precisely located and predictably oriented substitutions along the polymeric backbone.\nOur investigations focus on the use of oligoproline as a molecular scaffold. Toward this end, we have investigated the role of solvent upon helical structure of oligoproline, and the effect that substituents on the pyrrolidine ring and the oligomer termini have on the stability of the helix. We have also further explored the molecular characteristics of oligoproline through spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. All of these structural insights laid the basis for implementation of oligoproline in materials science and chemical biology.\nWithin this Account, we highlight the value of oligoprolines for applications in distinctly different research areas. Toward materials chemistry, we have utilized oligoprolines for the size-controlled generation of noble metal nanoparticles, and to probe the role of spatial preorganization of \u03c0-systems for molecular self-assembly. Within the biological realm, we have applied oligoprolines to probe the role of distance on G-protein coupled receptor-mediated ligand uptake by cancerous cells and to investigate the effects of charge preorganization on the efficacy of cationic cell-penetrating peptides.", "A non-science majors' chemistry course that satisfies both instructors and students has been a long and difficult quest.

In this article, a water-soluble polythiophene PTEBS was employed as a cathode interfacial material for PSCs. Efficient energy level aligning and improved film morphology were obtained due to an ultrathin coating of PTEBS. Better ohmic contact between the perovskite layer and the cathode also benefits the charge transport and extraction of the device. Moreover, less charge accumulation at the interface weakens the polarization of the perovskite resulting in a relatively quick response of the modified device. The ITO/PTEBS/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au cells by an all low-temperature process achieved power conversion efficiencies of up to 15.4% without apparent hysteresis effect. Consequently, the utilization of this water-soluble polythiophene is a practical approach for the fabrication of highly efficient, large-area, and low-cost PSCs and compatible with low-temperature solution process, roll-to-roll manufacture, and flexible application.", "Polyanion compounds have relatively low energy density compared to plain oxides as cathode materials. We for the first time report on a Li-rich fluorophosphate compound, Li5V2PO4F8, that can have high energy density originating from both the multielectron reaction of vanadium and high voltage induced by a fluorine. The developed material has a new crystal structure that has a robust three-dimensional framework of corner-sharing octahedra VO2F4 with tetrahedra PO4 and three-dimensional lithium ion diffusion pathways, which can facilitate the (de)intercalation of lithium ions. Its theoretical capacity is 285 mAh/g when two electrons are exploited. Practically, it shows the highest redox voltage, \u223c4.4 V (vs Li/Li+), among V3+/V4+ redox reactions, with 111 mAh/g of reversible capacity. Only in the first charge does it show an active redox reaction of the V4+/V5+ at \u223c4.9 V (vs Li/Li+) with 228 mAh/g of charge capacity. Moreover, the vanadium-deficient phase shows stable capacity retention and good rate capability at both charging and discharging rates up to the 2C rate. The discovery of the lithium- and fluorine-rich phosphate compounds reported here introduces a new family of cathode materials, and further exploration and optimization can be expected to unlock the full potential of this family.", "The integration of functions in materials in order to gain macroscopic effects in response to environmental changes is an ongoing challenge in material science. Here, functions on different hierarchical levels are sequentially linked to translate a pH-triggered conformational transition from the molecular to the macroscopic level to induce directed movements in hydrogels. When the pH is increased, lysine-rich peptide molecules change their conformation into a \u03b2-hairpin structure because of the reduced electrostatic repulsion among the deprotonated amino groups. Coupled to this conformation change is the capability of the \u03b2-hairpin motifs to subsequently assemble into aggregates acting as reversible cross-links, which are used as controlling units to fix a temporary macroscopic shape. A structural function implemented into the hydrogel by a microporous architecture-enabled nondisruptive deformation upon compression by buckling of pore walls and their elastic recovery. Coupled to this structural function is the capability of the porous material to enhance the diffusion of ions into the hydrogel and to keep the dimension of the macroscopic systems almost constant when the additional cross-links are formed or cleaved as it limits the dimensional change of the pore walls. Covalent cross-linking of the hydrogel into a polymer network acted as gear shift to ensure translation of the function on the molecular level to the macroscopic dimension. In this way, the information of a directed shape-shift can be programmed into the material by mechanical deformation and pH-dependent formation of temporary net points. The information could be read out by lowering the pH. The peptides reverted back into their original random coil conformation and the porous polymer network could recover from the previously applied elastic deformation. The level of multifunctionality of the hydrogels can be increased by implementation of additional orthogonal functions such as antimicrobicity by proper selection of multifunctional peptides, which could enable sophisticated biomedical devices.", "The incorporation of forensic science, a very popular field, into the chemistry curriculum can lead to increased student interest and engagement. Having seen forensic science applications in popular culture, even if not accurately portrayed, allows students to directly understand the potential application of what they are studying. Students also like to solve the mystery aspect of forensic scenarios. While entire lecture courses based on forensic science have been developed, the laboratory is the most natural fit for forensic science applications. This chapter presents lab experiments from a nonmajors introductory forensic science course as well as from labs designed for chemistry majors. Since many of the methods used in forensic science are analytical chemistry techniques, it is natural to incorporate forensic-themed experiments into the analytical chemistry curriculum. A high-performance liquid chromatography lab designed to analyze a simulated blood sample from a deceased subject for the presence of cardiac drugs is presented. Students need to both qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the blood sample in order to determine if the death was likely due to a drug overdose and, if so, whether it was likely accidental or intentional. This experiment is regularly taught in the junior-level majors Analytical Chemistry course. A second experiment taught in the upper-level majors Instrumental Analysis course is also presented. In this experiment, students analyze the atomic content of different types of matches to determine if they can differentiate the match types in a simulated arson analysis. All of the labs presented are routinely cited by the students as their favorite and the ones they most remember, indicating at least some advantage to incorporating forensic scenarios into the chemistry lab curriculum.", "Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a promising technique that converts wet biomass into a coal-like material and has a wide application to the fields of energy, material science, and nanotechnology. HTC has been primarily used to treat a limited number of feedstocks, mainly lignocellulosic biomass such as wood. Recently, the HTC process has been utilized to treat high-moisture-containing complex waste streams, a mixture of lignocellulosic and nonlignocellulosic biomass, such as sewage and municipal waste. However, there is limited knowledge on the effectiveness of HTC on purely nonlignocellulosic industrial waste like seafood waste. Processing of seafood generates enormous amounts of waste in the form of solid residues and liquid effluents. Currently there is a demand for attractive seafood waste utilization strategies that minimize environmental pollution while recovering products that are of commercial interest to the industry. In this study, we have devised one such strategy where seafood waste is pretreated by enzymatic hydrolysis for subsequent HTC to produce hydrochar and biocrude liquor. Enzyme hydrolysis conditions including enzyme concentration, incubation time, and enzyme ratios were carefully optimized for maximal hydrolysis of seafood waste. By using an enzyme cocktail of Viscozyme, Lipase, and Protease, it was found that an enzyme ratio of 1:1:1 (w/w/w), and an enzyme concentration of 10\u201320% with a treatment time of 16 h, resulted in maximal hydrolysis of fish and shrimp waste. Subsequently, hydrochar and biocrude liquor were generated from hydrolyzed fish and shrimp waste by microwave hydrothermal carbonization (MHTC) using a high-pressure Mini WAVE Digestion Module (SCP Science, Canada) with quartz vessels at conditions of 150 \u00b0C for a 1 h reaction time. The results of this study show for the first time that MHTC can be successfully employed to produce valuable products from pure nonlignocellulosic waste like seafood waste. This would pave the way for effective utilization of other moisture-rich nonlignocellulosic industrial wastes.", "With the introduction of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), curriculum and professional development have had to change rapidly to fit the new standards. To aid with those changes, the EQuIP rubric was released as a guide for NGSS alignment. This study aims to evaluate lesson plans developed through the Target Inquiry project to determine if the lessons developed under the National Science Education Standards are aligned with the new standards. The utility of the EQuIP rubric was also evaluated. Target Inquiry at Miami University (TIMU) teachers authored 19 lessons, which were evaluated using version 2 of the EQuIP rubric, which was modified to better fit the aims of the study. Each lesson evaluation included a numerical score in each of the EQuIP lesson quality criteria and a list of the grade band for each occurrence of an NGSS dimension (crosscutting concepts, disciplinary core ideas, and science and engineering practices). Overall, the lessons scored well on criteria concerning use of scientifically accurate information and direct evidence of student learning. The lessons did not score well on criteria that related to specific characteristics of the lesson plan format, which was unsurprising because the lessons were not written with the criteria of EQuIP in mind. It was also discovered that the lessons contained many occurrences of the dimensions that were below the 9\u201312 grade level. This could indicate that the level to which the NGSS expects teachers to be teaching is higher than what is currently ongoing in secondary classrooms. This study also has implications for NGSS implementation stemming from the intensive study required of the researchers to detect which specific NGSS standards were being applied in lessons with integrity. Better rubrics and a large amount of preparation is likely needed for teachers to learn to apply NGSS with fidelity.", "Green Chemistry is a call to arms for the next generation of students to study the physical sciences.

Thermal analysis using scanning calorimetry shows the compound to have a high melting point at 311.5 \u00b0C.

Aside from the high hole mobility, the compound possesses other important attributes required for a good hole-transporting host material for applications in organic electroluminescence. The photophysical property of HPCzI and its performance as a hole-transporting material in a double-layered electroluminescent device were investigated.

Few studies have been carried out on this material, and most of the important optical, electronic, and PEC properties are not yet known. We fabricated thin film Fe2WO6 photoanodes by spray pyrolysis and identified the performance limitations for PEC water oxidation. Poor charge separation is found to severely limit the photocurrent, which is caused by a large mismatch between the light penetration depth (\u223c300 nm) and carrier diffusion length (<10 nm) of the material. In addition, the conduction band of Fe2WO6 lies 0.65 V positive of the reversible hydrogen electrode potential, which means that a large external bias potential is required for water oxidation. On the basis of these observations, we critically discuss the suitability of Fe2WO6 as a novel photoelectrode material for photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic applications.", 0, "Double-perovskite materials of composition Sr2Mg1\u2013xCoxMoO6\u2212\u03b4 (SMCMO, x = 0 to 0.7) were evaluated as potential SOFC anode materials.

Co doping was found to increase the TEC of the Sr2MgMoO6\u2212\u03b4 material; however, the TEC was within the range of the commonly used La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-\u03b4 (LSGM) electrolyte. SMCMO also showed good chemical compatibility with the LSGM electrolyte at temperatures below 1300 \u00b0C. Both the electronic and ionic conductivity increased with increasing Co doping. To investigate the effect of Co doping on the conduction properties of SMCMO, we performed first-principle calculations. From these results, the weak Co\u2013O bond is considered to be responsible for the enhanced ionic conductivity of SMCMO materials. The substitution of Co was also found to increase the sinterability of SMCMO, resulting in a decrease in the polarization resistance of the SMMO electrode. Single-cell tests indicated the potential ability of the Co-doped SMMO to be used as SOFC anodes.", "Numerous online resources provide a variety of content for a wide range of STEM topics; however, they tend to function as isolated tidbits that provide content-specific knowledge. Application-based science education videosaddress the overlooked issue of concept to application by implementing experimental components in their videos and fostering connections with everyday applications. We utilized the Journal of Visualized Experiments (JoVE) peer-reviewed science education videos as homework assignments to supplement lectures on the topics of enthalpy, entropy, rate laws, and Le Ch\u00e2telier\u2019s principle in a second-term general chemistry course. Student learning was assessed through the analysis of pre- and post-video conceptual quizzes, and value surveys were also conducted to gather student feedback about the videos.

Important advances include detailed basic information on cations in zeolites, more understanding of the mechanism of zeolite formation, the formation and character of structural defects and hydroxyl groups, the role of zeolite structure in adsorption and catalysis, and the increasing technology of the use of molecular sieve zeolites in catalysis and adsorption.", "In this work, the asphaltenes from natural Indonesia asphalt rocks were taken as raw materials for the preparation of micromesoporous enriched carbon material through pyrolysis (<500 \u00b0C) and KOH activation (<900 \u00b0C) processes. It is found that, during the pyrolysis process, the asphaltenes could be converted to noncondensable gas (36.02%), pyrolytic tar (26.57%), and residual char (37.44%). When the char was mixed together with KOH for heating, more carbons would be released due to the activation reaction, forming a carbon network. The optimal activation conditions were obtained at KOH/char ratio of 3:1 and 800 \u00b0C for 30 min. Results also show that almost all of the nitrogen atoms stay in the solid carbon during heating with little releasing to the gas or liquid products. The final obtained porous carbon materials are determined to possess a specific surface area of 1735 m2/g with rich micropores (\u223c2.0 nm). Instrumental characterizations show that there are abundant heteroatomic groups, including S\u2550O, \u2014OH, and \u2014N\u2550, on the activated carbon surface. Further tests by adsorption indicate that the adsorption of methylene blue on the porous carbon material is monolayer adsorption. The maximal adsorption capacity is determined to be at 556.00 mg/g, much higher than that of some commercial activated carbons. It is also indicated that the adsorption kinetics follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. These findings suggest that the asphaltene derived carbon material would be promising efficient adsorbents. It also sheds lights on the resourcilization of asphaltenes.", "2-Methylimidazolate linkers of Pt@ZIF-8 are exchanged with imidazolate using solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE) to expand the apertures of the parent material and create Pt@SALEM-2. Characterization of the material before and after SALE was performed. Both materials are active as catalysts for the hydrogenation of 1-octene, whereas the hydrogenation of cis-cyclohexene occurred only with Pt@SALEM-2, consistent with larger apertures for the daughter material. The largest substrate, \u03b2-pinene, proved to be unreactive with H2 when either material was employed as a candidate catalyst, supporting the contention that substrate molecules, for both composites, must traverse the metal\u2013organic framework component in order to reach the catalytic nanoparticles.", "Spindle-like porous \u03b1-Fe2O3 was prepared from an iron-based metal organic framework (MOF) template. When tested as anode material for lithium batteries (LBs), this spindle-like porous \u03b1-Fe2O3 shows greatly enhanced performance of Li storage. The particle with a length and width of \u223c0.8 and \u223c0.4 \u03bcm, respectively, was composed of clustered Fe2O3 nanoparticles with sizes of <20 nm. The capacity of the porous \u03b1-Fe2O3 retained 911 mAh g\u20131 after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.2 C. Even when cycled at 10 C, comparable capacity of 424 mAh g\u20131 could be achieved.", "Compact polyelectrolyte complexes (COPECs), also named saloplastics, represent a new class of material with high fracture strain and self-healing properties. Here, COPECs based on poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) were prepared by centrifugation at pH 7. The influence of postassembly pH changes was monitored chemically by ATR-FTIR, ICP, DSC, and TGA, morphologically by SEM, and mechanically by strain to break measurements. Postassembly pH stimuli misbalanced the charge ratio in COPECs, impacting their concentration in counterions, cross-link density, and polymer chain mobility. At the material level, changes were observed in the porosity, composition, water content, and mechanical properties of COPECs. The cross-link density was a prominent factor governing the saloplastic\u2019s composition and water content. However, the porosity and mechanical properties were driven by several factors including salt-induced plasticization and conformational changes of polyelectrolytes. This work illustrates how multiple-scale consequences arise from a single change in the environment of COPECs, providing insights for future design of stimuli-responsive materials.", 0, "The organic molecular porous material 1 obtained by recrystallization of cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) from HCl shows a high CO2 sorption capacity at 298 K, 1 bar. Most interestingly, 1 showed the highest selectivity of CO2 over CO among the known porous materials so far. The remarkable selectivity of CO2 may be attributed to the exceptionally high enthalpy of adsorption (33.0 kJ/mol). X-ray crystal structure analysis of CO2 adsorbed 1 revealed three independent CO2 sorption sites: two in the 1D channels (A and B) and one in the molecular cavities (C). The CO2 molecules adsorbed at sorption site A near the wall of the 1D channels interact with 1 through hydrogen bonding and at the same time interact with those at site B mainly through quadrupole\u2212quadrupole interaction in a T-shaped arrangement. Interestingly, two CO2 molecules are included in the CB[6] cavity (site C), interacting not only with the carbonyl groups of CB[6] but also with each other in a slipped-parallel geometry. The exceptionally selective CO2 sorption properties of 1 may find useful applications in the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process for CO2 separation not only in the steel industry but also in other industries such as natural gas mining.", 0, 0, 0, "Anatase TiO2 nanotubes were synthesized via the hydrothermal method followed by annealing at 500 \u00b0C in argon for 1 h. The phase structure, morphology, and composition were investigated in detail by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. The material consists of nanotubes with diameter of 10\u201315 nm and lengths of several hundred nanometers. The electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. The data imply a first cycle irreversible capacity of 385 mAh/g, and capacities of 307 and 265 mAh/g after the second and 50th cycle, respectively, at C/10. The Coulombic efficiency of about 99% after cycle 50 implies excellent cycling stability. Hence anatase TiO2 nanotubes evidence great potential for usage in high-power lithium-ion batteries.", "An efficient hole-transporting material (HTM) is indispensable for high-performing perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which have recently emerged as a breakthrough photovoltaic technology. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of the transition metal complex (6,6\u2032-bis(1,1-di(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)-2,2\u2032-bipyridine)-iron(II/III) trifluoromethanesulfonate ([Fe(bpyPY4)](OTf)2+x) to act as an additive-free, solution-processable HTM in PSCs based on the formamidinium lead bromide absorber. State-of-the-art physical methods have been employed to characterize [Fe(bpyPY4)](OTf)2+x and, in particular, to demonstrate its significantly higher conductivity compared to that of the conventional HTM spiro-OMeTAD. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.2% was obtained for a device employing [Fe(bpyPY4)](OTf)2+x, which is the first evidence of the applicability as a HTM in a PSC of a solid material in which conductivity is provided by a redox transformation of a transition metal.", "A new interdisciplinary, introductory science course was offered for the first time during the 2007\u20132008 school year.

Formats have been consistently hands-on and feedback has been positive. Although it is too early to verify long-term benefit, these efforts show the receptiveness of the audience, the challenge represented by teachers of minimal background, and the utility of simple and practical lessons for engaging educators and students at various levels.", "Centimeter-size single crystals of the noncentrosymmetric and polar material Na2TeW2O9 were successfully grown through a top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) method. Differently oriented seeds, along the [100], [010], and [001] directions, were used to grow large single crystals. The morphologies of the grown crystals with different oriented seeds are described. Na2TeW2O9 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric and polar monoclinic space group Ia (No. 9). Functional properties including piezoelectricity and polarization were also measured. The d11 and d33 piezoelectric coefficients are 4.0 pC/N and 13.9 pC/N, respectively. Polarization measurements indicate that although Na2TeW2O9 is polar, the material is not ferroelectric; that is, the polarization is not switchable. In addition, optical measurements indicate a UV absorption edge near 360 nm, with a transmission window up to 5 \u03bcm.", 0, "By means of density functional theory (DFT) computations and global minimum search using particle-swarm optimization (PSO) method, we predicted three FeB6 monolayers, namely \u03b1-FeB6, \u03b2-FeB6 and \u03b3-FeB6, which consist of the Fe\u00a9Bx (x = 6, 8) wheels with planar hypercoordinate Fe atoms locating at the center of six- or eight-membered boron rings. In particular, the \u03b1-FeB6 sheet constructed by Fe\u00a9B8 motifs is the global minimum due to completely shared and well delocalized electrons. The two-dimensional (2D) boron networks are dramatically stabilized by the electron transfer from Fe atoms, and the FeB6 monolayers have pronounced stabilities. The \u03b1-FeB6 monolayer is metallic, while the \u03b2-FeB6 and \u03b3-FeB6 sheets are semiconductors with indirect band gaps and significant visible-light absorptions. Besides the novel chemical bonding, the high feasibility for experimental realization, and unique electronic and optical properties, render them very welcome new members to the graphene-like materials family.", "Negative differential resistance/transconductance (NDR/NDT) has been attracting significant attention as a key functionality in the development of multivalued logic (MVL) systems that can overcome the limits of conventional binary logic devices. A high peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) and more than double-peak transfer characteristics are required to achieve a stable MVL operation. In this study, an organic NDR (ONDR) device with double-peak transfer characteristics and a high peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR; >102) is fabricated by utilizing an organic material platform for the development of a key element device for MVL applications. The organic NDT (ONDT) device is fabricated using a series connection of electron-dominant (P(NDI2OD-Se2)) and hole-dominant (P(DPP2DT-T2)) channel ambipolar organic field-effect transistors (AOFETs), and the NDR feature is achieved via correlated biasing of the ONDT device. The PVCR of the ONDT device can reach up to 13,000 via carrier transfer modulation of the AOFETs by varying the PMMA:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio of the mixed layer that is used as the top-gate dielectric of each AOFET. Further, ternary latch circuit operation is demonstrated using the developed ONDR device that stores three logic states with three distinct and controllable output states by adjusting the PMMA:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio of the dielectric layer.", "Light-weighting of passenger cars using high-strength steel or aluminum is a common emissions mitigation strategy. We provide a first estimate of the global impact of light-weighting by material substitution on GHG emissions from passenger cars and the steel and aluminum industries until 2050. We develop a dynamic stock model of the global car fleet and combine it with a dynamic MFA of the associated steel, aluminum, and energy supply industries. We propose four scenarios for substitution of conventional steel with high-strength steel and aluminum at different rates over the period 2010\u20132050. We show that light-weighting of passenger cars can become a \u201cgigaton solution\u201d: Between 2010 and 2050, persistent light-weighting of passenger cars can, under optimal conditions, lead to cumulative GHG emissions savings of 9\u201318 gigatons CO2-eq compared to development business-as-usual. Annual savings can be up to 1 gigaton per year. After 2030, enhanced material recycling can lead to further reductions: closed-loop metal recycling in the automotive sector may reduce cumulative emissions by another 4\u20136 gigatons CO2-eq. The effectiveness of emissions mitigation by material substitution significantly depends on how the recycling system evolves. At present, policies focusing on tailpipe emissions and life cycle assessments of individual cars do not consider this important effect.", "Many-body interactions in photoexcited semiconductors can bring about strongly interacting electronic states, culminating in the fully ionized matter of electron\u2013hole plasma (EHP) and electron\u2013hole liquid (EHL). These exotic phases exhibit unique electronic properties, such as metallic conductivity and metastable high photoexcitation density, which can be the basis for future transformative applications. However, the cryogenic condition required for its formation has limited the study of dense plasma phases to a purely academic pursuit in a restricted parameter space. This paradigm can potentially change with the recent experimental observation of these phases in atomically thin MoS2 and MoTe2 at room temperature. A fundamental understanding of EHP and EHL dynamics is critical for developing novel applications on this versatile layered platform. In this work, we studied the formation and dissipation of EHP in monolayer MoS2. Unlike previous results in bulk semiconductors, our results reveal that electromechanical material changes in monolayer MoS2 during photoexcitation play a significant role in dense EHP formation. Within the free-standing geometry, photoexcitation is accompanied by an unconstrained thermal expansion, resulting in a direct-to-indirect gap electronic transition at a critical lattice spacing and fluence. This dramatic altering of the material\u2019s energetic landscape extends carrier lifetimes by 2 orders of magnitude and allows the density required for EHP formation. The result is a stable dense plasma state that is sustained with modest optical photoexcitation. Our findings pave the way for novel applications based on dense plasma states in two-dimensional semiconductors.", 0, "Laser damage threshold (LDT) and the second harmonic generation (SHG) effect have been considered as key parameters of infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Infrared NLO crystals with both large LDT and strong SHG efficiency are very scarce. The combination of the V5+ cations with d0 electrons and alkali metal Li+ cations generates an IR NLO material, low temperature phase Li3VO4. The single crystal of Li3VO4 with sizes up to 25 mm \u00d7 14 mm \u00d7 3 mm has been grown by the top-seeded solution growth method using the V2O5 flux in an open system in this work. The material exhibits a large LDT value of 125.5 MW/cm2, which is about 25 times that of AgGaS2. The inclusion-free Li3VO4 crystal is very favorable for improving the LDT. It also exhibits an excellent SHG response: 1.6 times that of AgGaS2, the benchmark IR NLO crystal at 2090 nm, and 9.5 times that of KDP, the benchmark UV NLO crystal at 1064 nm. Electronic structure and optical properties studies elucidate that the large NLO responses originate mainly from the polarities of the VO4 tetrahedra and partly from the LiO4 tetrahedra. Additionally, a superior crystal growth method, comparatively simple chemical composition, and wide transmission range enable Li3VO4 to possess much better comprehensive performances for practical mid-IR NLO applications.", "Understanding the charge generation dynamics in organic photovoltaic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends is important for providing the necessary guidelines to improve overall device efficiency. Despite more than 15 years of experimental and theoretical studies, a universal picture describing the generation and recombination processes operating in organic photovoltaic devices is still being forged. We report here the results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy measurements of charge photogeneration and recombination processes in a high-performing solution-processed molecular BHJ. For comparison, we also studied a high-performing polymer-based BHJ material. We find that the majority of charge carriers in both systems are generated on <100 fs time scales and posit that excited state delocalization is responsible for the ultrafast charge transfer. This initial delocalization is consistent with the fundamental uncertainty associated with the photon absorption process (in the visible, \u03bb/4\u03c0 > 30 nm) and is comparable with the phase-separated domain size. In addition, exciton diffusion to charge-separating heterojunctions is observed at longer times (1\u2013500 ps). Finally, charge generation in pure films of the solution processed molecule was studied. Polarization anisotropy measurements clearly demonstrate that the optical properties are dominated by molecular (Frenkel) exictons and delocalized charges are promptly produced (t < 100 fs).", "Ag2V4O11 nanotubes were synthesized by means of a facile surfactant-assisted hydrothermal process and developed as a novel visible-light-sensitive photocatalyst for 2-propanol (IPA) decomposition. The Ag2V4O11 nanotubes were single-crystalline and showed a uniform size with a diameter of about 10 nm in width and micrometer-sized length. The material can absorb a wide range of light irradiation up to 600 nm. The band gap of Ag2V4O11 was determined to be 2.0 eV according to the diffuse reflectance spectrum of the sample. The electronic structures and band edge positions of Ag2V4O11 were theoretically calculated on the basis of density functional theory and the constituent atom\u2019s Mulliken electronegativity, respectively. It was revealed that the valence band consisted of Ag 4d and O 2p orbitals, while the conduction band was constructed by V 3d and Ag 5s5p orbitals. Compared with commercial N\u2212TiO2, the Ag2V4O11 nanotube catalyst exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity for IPA degradation under visible-light irradiation. It was possibly ascribed to the narrow band gap, highly mobile charge carriers, and tubular structure.", "Environmental technologies depend on raw materials, some of which are subject to volatile costs and availability concerns. One way to address these concerns is through substitution, of which there are many types. An important form of substitution in the short term is adopting an alternative production process, yielding a material with the same functional properties with less material input. In effect, technology substitutes for material. This study elucidates the role increased and uncertain material costs play in inducing different substitution types in the short to medium term. Specifically, this paper uses an expert survey to determine the relative importance of eight specific industry responses taken by magnet and wind turbine manufacturers in response to the 2010/2011 rare-earth price spike through 2016. Statistical tests show adopting an existing production process for magnets was the most important response, followed by cost passthrough, using an alternate magnet grade in a redesigned generator system, and using alternate systems altogether. The paper also provides specific findings for the magnet and wind turbine industries with respect to each substitution type.", "Protective coatings are often erroneously thought of as perfect environmental barriers for metal substrates; however, a host of corrosion inducing environmental contaminants permeate through defect-free coatings. Carbon nanotubes are high aspect ratio nanofillers with unique mechanical, electrical, and polymer interaction properties with well-established yet, for practical reasons, often unrealized potential. The research objective was to quantify and understand the influential effects and relationships between low concentration levels of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) dispersed into epoxy-amine matrix materials and the different water hydrogen bonding interactions on corrosion rates of steel substrates. We hypothesize that when water directly hydrogen bonds with polymer, substrate and/or MWCNTS, the localized water\u2019s capacity to transfer environmental contaminants through the coating, i.e., to and from the substrate, diminishes due to a reduced potential to contribute to the formation of water hydration shells and therefore aid in diminishing the corrosion rate. We measured the absolute pre-exposure water content, and monitored to delineate between the ratio and shifting ratio of in situ free versus bound water hydrogen bonding interactions at the coating/air interface using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in a 5% NaCl fog environment in an attempt to correlate these differences with experimental corrosion rates. Free water content was reduced from \u223c20% to <1% of the total water concentration when 1.0 wt % MWCNTs was dispersed into the parent polymer network. Concurrently, the bound water content was measured to shift from \u223c2% to >80% with the same MWCNT concentration. The MWCNT bound water resulted in 25% less corrosion for the same steel substrates albeit the measured water vapor diffusivity was the same for each material combination evaluated. Interestingly, the measured pre-exposure bound water content was predictive of which material would corrode slowest and fastest, i.e., the ratio of starting water states seems to be mechanistically related to the corrosion process and the values have potential to predict corrosion rates for a variety of samples evaluated.", "Al binding to biomaterial derived from cell wall fragments of the plant Datura innoxia has been investigated using solid-state 27Al NMR spectroscopy. Carboxylate groups have been determined to be the responsible functionalities for Al3+ binding to this material at pH 3.5. The binding of Al3+ directly to the polysilicate structure of the immobilized biomaterial was also observed. At pH 5.0, direct binding of the Al137+ polymer ion to the biomaterial was discovered. Carboxylate groups were also determined to be involved in the binding of Al3+ at pH 5.0. The presence of an additional octahedral Al-binding site was also suggested at the higher pH.", 0, 0, "The influence of average molar mass and shear on the crystallization of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) has been studied. The Weissenberg number, a dimensionless parameter consisting of the product of the shear rate and a characteristic relaxation time (\u03b3\u03070\u03bbr), provides a criterion to locate the morphological transition from spherulitic to extended growth. The Weissenberg criterion applies to polymers of high and of low molecular weight. This is attributed to the importance of the initial nucleation process. Comparison of materials of different molar masses and various shear histories is allowed by the introduction of the normalized crystallization time \u03c4, which is the ratio of the experimental time and a characteristic crystallization time \u03bbVvmax that needs to be defined from the several possible choices. Rheological and rheooptical experiments furnish the material characteristic relaxation and crystallization time scales, respectively. The time \u03bbVvmax, defined with light scattering as the moment at maximum density fluctuation invariant Q\u03b7, is chosen here as a characteristic crystallization time scale since it is especially sensitive to the early stages of crystal growth that are responsible for the liquid-to-solid transition. DSC and WAXD have been used to further analyze the effect of shear on the populations of crystalline fractions present in the cooled iPP samples.", "A new tobacco filler Standard Reference Material (SRM) has been issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in September 2016 with certified and reference mass fraction values for nicotine, N-nitrosonornicotine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, and volatiles. The constituents have been determined by multiple analytical methods with measurements at NIST and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and with confirmatory measurements by commercial laboratories. This effort highlights the development of the first SRM for reduced nicotine and reduced tobacco-specific nitrosamines with certified values for composition.", "Understanding the complexity and sustainability of infrastructure development is crucial for reconciling economic growth, human well-being, and environmental conservation. However, previous studies on infrastructure\u2019s material metabolism were mainly conducted on a global or national scale, due largely to lack of more spatially refined data, and thus could not reveal the spatial patterns and dynamics on a city scale. Here, we integrated material flow analysis (MFA) and geographical information system (GIS) data to uncover the spatiotemporal patterns of the material stocks and flows accompanying the infrastructure development at a high spatial resolution for the case of Shanghai, China. From 1980 to 2010, material stocks and waste output flows of Shanghai\u2019s infrastructure system exhibited a significant increase from 83 to 561 million metric tons (Mt) and from 2 to 17 Mt, respectively. Input flows peaked in 2005 because of the economic slowdown and stepped-up policies to cool the housing market. Spatially, the center and peri-urban areas were the largest container of material stocks and biggest generator of demolition waste, while suburban areas absorbed 58%\u201376% of material inputs. Plans to make the city more compact will enhance the service capacity of stocks but may also increase the use of more energy and emissions-intensive construction materials (e.g., steel). Prolonging the service lifetime of infrastructure through proper management and increasing the recycling and reuse rate of demolition waste are also identified as highly efficient strategies.", "Improved methods are needed to access and understand coating knowledge that is stored in computers.

Rigorous, yet simple, mathematical proofs are given for some of the fundamental concepts, particularly how metrics for overall plan material performance are related to their composite counterparts for individual reactions. Throughout this exposition, whenever a synthesis scheme is examined, it is converted into a compact tree diagram that is used to depict plans of any degree of complexity (linear or convergent) as a means to conveniently keep track of all reagents, intermediates, reaction yields, stoichiometric coefficients, number of branches, number of reaction steps, and convergent steps. We demonstrate that such tree diagrams facilitate the computation of material efficiency metrics for any individual reaction in a plan as well as for the entire plan. We also show how such diagrams may be used to plan schedules for reaction operations when multiple linear branches are run concurrently. For brevity the Supporting Information contains full solutions to posed problems.", "We demonstrate the complete exchange of the interlamellar anions of a 2-D cationic inorganic material.

Both were solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction and the transformation also followed by in situ optical microscopy and ex situ powder X-ray diffraction.

We investigate Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities as a function of temperature between 300 and 400 K as well as in-plane thermal conductivities using Angstrom\u2019s method. We further demonstrate equipment-free fabrication of flexible thermoelectric modules using p- and n-type paper strips.

Then, recent results on one candidate material, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), are presented. PAN pyrolyzed above about 200\u00b0C displays the structural, electrical conductivity and optical properties expected of a one-dimensional semiconductor, including an optical absorption edge at ~1.0-2.0 eV. After pyrolysis at temperatures above about 350-400\u00b0C a sharp transition to more metallic behavior is observed, with high conductivity (~10\u00b0 (ohm-cm)-1), low activation energy (~0.1 eV), and broad optical absorption. Areas for further investigation are indicated.", "The methodology based on target-responsive structural switching is powerful in bioanalysis with the controllability and sensitivity. In this paper, an aptamer-functionalized DNA hydrogel was designed as a specifically target-responsive switchable material for protein detection. This pure DNA hydrogel was constructed by using a Y-shaped DNA and an aptamer linker through a DNA self-assembly without synthetic polymer backbone. With use of thrombin as the model analyte, the DNA hydrogel was first applied to visual detection with the entrapped Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) as indicating agent. Furthermore, the positively charged quantum dots (QDs) as the fluorophore were synthesized by using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as wrapper and characterized with spectroscopy, transmission electron micrograph, \u03b6 potential, and dynamic laser scattering techniques. Along with a gel-to-sol transition in the presence of the target, the released negatively charged AuNPs from the hydrogel could approach the positively charged QDs. Due to the electrostatic interaction, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between PEI-QDs and AuNPs therefore occurred and quenched the fluorescence signal for the sensitive detection of thrombin. This assay for the detection of thrombin showed a good linear relationship in a range of 0.075 to 12.5 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 67 nM at 3\u03c3, and demonstrated excellent feasibility in complex serum matrixes. The biocompatible DNA hydrogel provides a universal switchable material for signal transduction and significantly demonstrates proof-of-concept for the detection of proteins.", "The impacts and variability of inorganic material (measured as total ash) on surface area, surface energy, wettability, and cohesion of corn stover samples from Iowa were examined. The impact of total ash on the acid component of surface energy was determined to be significant with the acid component increasing with increasing ash content, in particular, the samples with total ash contents greater than 10%. Negligible effects with ash content were observed on both the dispersive and base components of surface energy. The work of cohesion for the compositions of corn stover with varying amounts of total inorganic matter increased with increasing total ash content, giving rise to potential bulk solids handling and transport challenges related to segregation, agglomeration, rat-holing, arching, and discontinuous flow patterns. Both the wettability (hydrophilicity) and work of cohesion increased for compositions of corn stover with increasing total inorganic content. Washing proved effective at removing extrinsic inorganic material from corn stover with a reduction in total ash content from 20.4% to 6.2%, accompanied by a significant reduction (from 85.6 to 42.5 mJ/m2) in the acid component of the surface energy.", 0, "The development of high-performance submucosal injection materials (SIMs) has significantly contributed to the advancement of rapid and safe endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). A previous study authored by us described that pseudoplastic fluid was more suitable for high-performance SIMs than Newtonian fluid. Herein, a novel high-performance SIM is developed, which is primarily composed of sodium polyacrylate (SPA) and exhibits pseudoplastic fluid characteristics. As a representative of current high-performance SIMs with Newtonian fluid characteristics, 0.4% sodium hyaluronate (HA) was selected as the target for comparison. Further, viscoelasticity, submucosal elevation height (SEH), and injection pressure (IP) of HA and SPA were evaluated. The results obtained by ESD were compared using HA or SPA in an ex vivo model. According to the measured viscoelasticity, the concentration of SPA was adjusted to 0.07%; this was aimed at obtaining the IP of SPA, which is equal to that of 0.4% HA. Moreover, no significant difference was observed between the IP values (31.6 \u00b1 1.7 vs 31.4 \u00b1 3.1 psi). SEHs of 0.07% SPA were higher than those of 0.4% HA at all postinjection times (P < 0.001). The duration of the ESD procedure using 0.07% SPA was significantly shorter than that obtained using 0.4% HA (16.6 \u00b1 3.7 vs 22.2 \u00b1 2.9 min, P = 0.0276); further, the total volume of the injected 0.07% SPA was significantly less than that of 0.4% HA (9.0 \u00b1 3.1 vs 15.7 \u00b1 3.9 mL, P = 0.0165). Based on rheological analysis, a high-performance SIM (0.07% SPA) with pseudoplastic fluid characteristics was theoretically developed. It was observed that the SIM performance of 0.07% SPA was higher than that of 0.4% HA.", "Steam explosion is a thermo-mechanicochemical pretreatment which allows the breakdown of lignocellulosic structural components by the action of heating, formation of organic acids during the process, and shearing forces resulting in the expansion of the moisture. Two distinct stages compose the steam-explosion process: vapocracking and explosive decompression which include modification of the material components: hydrolysis of hemicellulosic components (mono- and oligosaccharides released), modification of the chemical structure of lignin, and modification of the cellulose crystallinity index, etc. These effects allow the opening of lignocellulosic structures and influence the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of the material.", "The hydrogen storage/release phenomena on a lithium hydride-polyacetylene composite (LiH-PA) are reported.

Application-based science education videosaddress the overlooked issue of concept to application by implementing experimental components in their videos and fostering connections with everyday applications. We utilized the Journal of Visualized Experiments (JoVE) peer-reviewed science education videos as homework assignments to supplement lectures on the topics of enthalpy, entropy, rate laws, and Le Ch\u00e2telier\u2019s principle in a second-term general chemistry course. Student learning was assessed through the analysis of pre- and post-video conceptual quizzes, and value surveys were also conducted to gather student feedback about the videos.

Sonochemistry in the true sense of the term occurs when ultrasound induces \u201ctrue\u201d chemical effects on the reaction system, such as forming free radicals which accelerate the reaction. However, ultrasound may have other mechanical effects on the reaction, such as increasing the surface area between the reactants, accelerating dissolution, and/or renewing the surface of a solid reactant or catalyst. This comprehensive review summarizes several topics of study in the sonochemical literature, including bubble dynamics, factors affecting cavitation, the effects of ultrasound on a variety of chemical systems, modeling of kinetic and mass-transfer effects, the methods used to produce ultrasound, proposed cavitation reactors, and the problems of scaleup.

Characterization of the material before and after SALE was performed. Both materials are active as catalysts for the hydrogenation of 1-octene, whereas the hydrogenation of cis-cyclohexene occurred only with Pt@SALEM-2, consistent with larger apertures for the daughter material. The largest substrate, \u03b2-pinene, proved to be unreactive with H2 when either material was employed as a candidate catalyst, supporting the contention that substrate molecules, for both composites, must traverse the metal\u2013organic framework component in order to reach the catalytic nanoparticles.", "Ag2V4O11 nanotubes were synthesized by means of a facile surfactant-assisted hydrothermal process and developed as a novel visible-light-sensitive photocatalyst for 2-propanol (IPA) decomposition. The Ag2V4O11 nanotubes were single-crystalline and showed a uniform size with a diameter of about 10 nm in width and micrometer-sized length. The material can absorb a wide range of light irradiation up to 600 nm. The band gap of Ag2V4O11 was determined to be 2.0 eV according to the diffuse reflectance spectrum of the sample. The electronic structures and band edge positions of Ag2V4O11 were theoretically calculated on the basis of density functional theory and the constituent atom\u2019s Mulliken electronegativity, respectively. It was revealed that the valence band consisted of Ag 4d and O 2p orbitals, while the conduction band was constructed by V 3d and Ag 5s5p orbitals. Compared with commercial N\u2212TiO2, the Ag2V4O11 nanotube catalyst exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity for IPA degradation under visible-light irradiation. It was possibly ascribed to the narrow band gap, highly mobile charge carriers, and tubular structure.", "Compact polyelectrolyte complexes (COPECs), also named saloplastics, represent a new class of material with high fracture strain and self-healing properties. Here, COPECs based on poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) were prepared by centrifugation at pH 7. The influence of postassembly pH changes was monitored chemically by ATR-FTIR, ICP, DSC, and TGA, morphologically by SEM, and mechanically by strain to break measurements. Postassembly pH stimuli misbalanced the charge ratio in COPECs, impacting their concentration in counterions, cross-link density, and polymer chain mobility. At the material level, changes were observed in the porosity, composition, water content, and mechanical properties of COPECs. The cross-link density was a prominent factor governing the saloplastic\u2019s composition and water content. However, the porosity and mechanical properties were driven by several factors including salt-induced plasticization and conformational changes of polyelectrolytes. This work illustrates how multiple-scale consequences arise from a single change in the environment of COPECs, providing insights for future design of stimuli-responsive materials.", "The construction industry is under considerable legislative pressure to reduce its CO2 emissions. The current focus is on operational CO2 emissions, but as these are compulsorily reduced, the embodied CO2 of structural components, overwhelmingly attributable to the material from which they are manufactured, will become of greater interest. Choice of structural materials for minimal embodied CO2 is currently based either on subjective narrative arguments, or values of embodied CO2 per unit volume or mass. Here we show that such arguments are invalid. We found that structural design parameters (dimensions, section choice, and load capacity) for fundamental structural components (simple beams and columns) are at least as important as material choice with regard to their effect on embodied CO2 per unit load capacity per unit dimension, which can vary over several decades within and between material choices. This result demonstrates that relying on apparently objective analyses based on embodied CO2 per unit volume or mass will not lead to minimum carbon solutions; a formal definition of the correct functional unit for embodied CO2 must be used. In short, there is no such thing as a green structural material.", 0, "Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) provide employers, employees, emergency responders, and the general public with basic information about the hazards associated with chemicals that are used in the workplace and are a part of every-day commerce. They are a primary information resource used by health, safety, and environmental professionals in communicating the hazards of chemicals and in making risk management decisions. Engineered nanomaterials represent a growing class of materials being manufactured and introduced into multiple business sectors. MSDSs were obtained from a total of 44 manufacturers using Internet search engines, and a simple ranking scheme was developed to evaluate the content of the data sheets. The MSDSs were reviewed using the ranking scheme, and categorized on the quality and completeness of information as it pertains to hazard identification, exposure controls, personal protective equipment (PPE), and toxicological information being communicated about the engineered nanomaterial. The ranking scheme used to evaluate the MSDSs for engineered nanomaterials was based on the determination that the data sheet should include information on specific physical properties, including particle size or particle size distribution, and physical form; specific toxicological and health effects; and protective measures that can be taken to control potential exposures. The first MSDSs for nanomaterials began to appear around 2006, so these were collected in the time period of 2007\u20132008. Comparison of MSDSs and changes over time were evaluated as MSDSs were obtained again in 2010\u20132011. The majority (67%) of the MSDSs obtained in 2010\u20132011 still provided insufficient data for communicating the potential hazards of engineered nanomaterials.", "Removal of nitrate from water has been receiving growing attention in water treatment. In this study, we report the photocatalytic denitrification (PCDN) by nonlinear optical (NLO) material, i.e. lithium niobate (LiNbO3). The hydrothermally synthesized LiNbO3 powder could achieve efficient denitrification in water, evidenced by 98.4% nitrate removal and 95.8% nitrogen selectivity at reaction time of 120 min and pH-neutral condition. Based on the first-order kinetics of PCDN, the kinetic constant for LiNbO3 is almost three times as that of conventional TiO2 (P25) under the same conditions. As suggested by the hole scavenger experiments, the LiNbO3 should proceed with photocatalytic reduction of nitrate through direct heterogeneous interaction with electrons at the conduction band of LiNbO3. This may represent a different mechanism from P25, where nitrate is mainly reduced by CO2\u2022\u2013 radicals generated by the holes at the valence band. The unique second harmonic generation (SHG) effects of NLO materials enable them to produce more electrons and minimize the electron-hole recombination, which improves the efficiency and stability of the PCDN process. The current study provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of NLO photocatalytic material for more effective nitrate removal in water treatment.", 0, "Researchers teasing out genetic codes from plants, animals, fungi, and microbes of all sorts have deposited quadrillions of digital nucleotide sequences in open access databases.

However, lack of cathode materials with considerable capacities in conventional nonaqueous electrolyte at ambient temperature is one of the great challenges for their practical applications. Here, we present high magnesium-ion storage performance and evidence for the electrochemical magnesiation of ammonium vanadium bronze NH4V4O10 as a cathode material for MIBs. NH4V4O10 was synthesized via a conventional hydrothermal reaction. It shows reversible magnesiation with an initial discharge capacity of 174.8 mAh g\u20131 and the average discharge voltage of \u223c2.31 V (vs Mg/Mg2+) using 0.5 M Mg(ClO4)2 in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic, discharge\u2013charge, FTIR, XPS, powder XRD, and elemental analyses unequivocally show evidence for the reversible magnesiation of the material and suggest that keeping the ammonium ions in the interlayer space of NH4V4O10 could be crucial for the structural stability with a sacrifice of initial capacity but much enhanced retention capacity. This is the first demonstration of electrochemical magnesiation with a high capacity above 2 V (vs Mg/Mg2+) using a conventional organic electrolyte with a relatively low water concentration.", "Understanding the complexity and sustainability of infrastructure development is crucial for reconciling economic growth, human well-being, and environmental conservation. However, previous studies on infrastructure\u2019s material metabolism were mainly conducted on a global or national scale, due largely to lack of more spatially refined data, and thus could not reveal the spatial patterns and dynamics on a city scale. Here, we integrated material flow analysis (MFA) and geographical information system (GIS) data to uncover the spatiotemporal patterns of the material stocks and flows accompanying the infrastructure development at a high spatial resolution for the case of Shanghai, China. From 1980 to 2010, material stocks and waste output flows of Shanghai\u2019s infrastructure system exhibited a significant increase from 83 to 561 million metric tons (Mt) and from 2 to 17 Mt, respectively. Input flows peaked in 2005 because of the economic slowdown and stepped-up policies to cool the housing market. Spatially, the center and peri-urban areas were the largest container of material stocks and biggest generator of demolition waste, while suburban areas absorbed 58%\u201376% of material inputs. Plans to make the city more compact will enhance the service capacity of stocks but may also increase the use of more energy and emissions-intensive construction materials (e.g., steel). Prolonging the service lifetime of infrastructure through proper management and increasing the recycling and reuse rate of demolition waste are also identified as highly efficient strategies.", "As a potential cathode material for the ICD lithium battery, one advantage of Ag6Mo2O7F3Cl (SMOFC) is its enhanced gravimetric capacity of ca. 133 mAh/g above 3 V (vs Li+/Li) delivered by two biphasic transitions at 3.46 and 3.39 V (vs Li+/Li).

Carbon nanotubes are high aspect ratio nanofillers with unique mechanical, electrical, and polymer interaction properties with well-established yet, for practical reasons, often unrealized potential. The research objective was to quantify and understand the influential effects and relationships between low concentration levels of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) dispersed into epoxy-amine matrix materials and the different water hydrogen bonding interactions on corrosion rates of steel substrates. We hypothesize that when water directly hydrogen bonds with polymer, substrate and/or MWCNTS, the localized water\u2019s capacity to transfer environmental contaminants through the coating, i.e., to and from the substrate, diminishes due to a reduced potential to contribute to the formation of water hydration shells and therefore aid in diminishing the corrosion rate. We measured the absolute pre-exposure water content, and monitored to delineate between the ratio and shifting ratio of in situ free versus bound water hydrogen bonding interactions at the coating/air interface using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in a 5% NaCl fog environment in an attempt to correlate these differences with experimental corrosion rates. Free water content was reduced from \u223c20% to <1% of the total water concentration when 1.0 wt % MWCNTs was dispersed into the parent polymer network. Concurrently, the bound water content was measured to shift from \u223c2% to >80% with the same MWCNT concentration. The MWCNT bound water resulted in 25% less corrosion for the same steel substrates albeit the measured water vapor diffusivity was the same for each material combination evaluated. Interestingly, the measured pre-exposure bound water content was predictive of which material would corrode slowest and fastest, i.e., the ratio of starting water states seems to be mechanistically related to the corrosion process and the values have potential to predict corrosion rates for a variety of samples evaluated.", 0, "Green Chemistry is a call to arms for the next generation of students to study the physical sciences.

The goal of this viewpoint paper was to summarize the current progress toward understanding the role of oxidative damage to neurons and microelectrodes. Further, we seek to highlight the initial antioxidative approaches to mitigate oxidative damage, as well as suggest how current advances in macromolecular science for various applications may play a distinct role in enabling intracortical microelectrodes as reliable choices for long-term neuroprosthetic applications.", "For the integration of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) with high-performance electronic systems, one of the greatest challenges is the realization of doping and comprehension of its mechanisms. Low-temperature atomic layer deposition of aluminum oxide is found to n-dope MoS2 and ReS2 but not WS2. Based on electrical, optical, and chemical analyses, we propose and validate a hypothesis to explain the doping mechanism. Doping is ascribed to donor states in the band gap of AlxOy, which donate electrons or not, based on the alignment of the electronic bands of the 2D TMDC. Through systematic experimental characterization, incorporation of impurities (e.g., carbon) is identified as the likely cause of such states. By modulating the carbon concentration in the capping oxide, doping can be controlled. Through systematic and comprehensive experimental analysis, this study correlates, for the first time, 2D TMDC doping to the carbon incorporation on dielectric encapsulation layers. We highlight the possibility to engineer dopant layers to control the material selectivity and doping concentration in 2D TMDC.", 0, "Thin film organic polymer semiconductors are suggested as an attractive option for cost-effective photovoltaic devices.

The Weissenberg number, a dimensionless parameter consisting of the product of the shear rate and a characteristic relaxation time (\u03b3\u03070\u03bbr), provides a criterion to locate the morphological transition from spherulitic to extended growth. The Weissenberg criterion applies to polymers of high and of low molecular weight. This is attributed to the importance of the initial nucleation process. Comparison of materials of different molar masses and various shear histories is allowed by the introduction of the normalized crystallization time \u03c4, which is the ratio of the experimental time and a characteristic crystallization time \u03bbVvmax that needs to be defined from the several possible choices. Rheological and rheooptical experiments furnish the material characteristic relaxation and crystallization time scales, respectively. The time \u03bbVvmax, defined with light scattering as the moment at maximum density fluctuation invariant Q\u03b7, is chosen here as a characteristic crystallization time scale since it is especially sensitive to the early stages of crystal growth that are responsible for the liquid-to-solid transition.

The appearances of their concomitant as well as exclusive polymorphic forms were discovered upon systematic crystallization experiments using various solvents. Determination of X-ray crystal structures confirmed that the polymorphs crystallize in centrosymmetric (P21/n) and non-centrosymmetric (Fdd2) space groups. A search using the Cambridge Structural Database revealed that there exist only 10 such polymorphic pairs. Reversible phase transitions and the switching ability between the polymorphs can be achieved via both heat and solvents as stimuli. Structural analysis confirmed that the polymorphs have two-dimensional similarity. Further, quantitative and qualitative analysis of interaction energies based on the UNI force field and energy frameworks indicate that they possess very similar energies, although the centrosymmetric form is slightly lower in energy. A comparably high value of second harmonic generation activity and the NLO properties as estimated based on gas-phase and in-crystal calculations suggest that the non-centrosymmetric form could be a potential NLO material. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the rarest of its kind to show the reversibility and switching ability between centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric polymorphic phases in an organic material, induced via both thermal and solvent stimuli.", "Lead-based halide perovskites (APbX3) are fascinating optoelectronic materials. Because of toxicity issues of Pb, Sn-based halide perovskites are studied, although less so, as an alternative. Adding SnF2 often improves the properties of Sn halide perovskite-based devices. This effect is usually ascribed to suppression of Sn2+ \u2192 Sn4+ oxidation and/or decreased Sn vacancy concentration. These effects will change the doping, sometimes in opposite directions. Here we review the effect of addition of SnF2 during the formation of ASnX3 layers as observed by different groups, both to the properties of the layers themselves and to photovoltaic cells made from these layers. SnF2 can affect many different properties of the ASnX3 perovskites, including film morphology, doping, control over formation of unwanted crystal phases, material stability to various factors, and energy level positions. It also improves (in general) the performance of photovoltaic cells made with these layers. Besides focusing on all these issues, we also describe possible doping scenarios for the perovskites, including some that do not appear to have been considered before and conclude that the doping mechanism depends strongly on whether the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ occurs during the materials preparation or after the film is formed, and if oxygen is involved.", "The methodology based on target-responsive structural switching is powerful in bioanalysis with the controllability and sensitivity. In this paper, an aptamer-functionalized DNA hydrogel was designed as a specifically target-responsive switchable material for protein detection. This pure DNA hydrogel was constructed by using a Y-shaped DNA and an aptamer linker through a DNA self-assembly without synthetic polymer backbone. With use of thrombin as the model analyte, the DNA hydrogel was first applied to visual detection with the entrapped Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) as indicating agent. Furthermore, the positively charged quantum dots (QDs) as the fluorophore were synthesized by using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as wrapper and characterized with spectroscopy, transmission electron micrograph, \u03b6 potential, and dynamic laser scattering techniques. Along with a gel-to-sol transition in the presence of the target, the released negatively charged AuNPs from the hydrogel could approach the positively charged QDs. Due to the electrostatic interaction, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between PEI-QDs and AuNPs therefore occurred and quenched the fluorescence signal for the sensitive detection of thrombin. This assay for the detection of thrombin showed a good linear relationship in a range of 0.075 to 12.5 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 67 nM at 3\u03c3, and demonstrated excellent feasibility in complex serum matrixes. The biocompatible DNA hydrogel provides a universal switchable material for signal transduction and significantly demonstrates proof-of-concept for the detection of proteins.", "A molecularly imprinted polymer with immobilized Au nanoparticles (Au-MIP) is reported as a novel type of sensing material. The sensing mechanism is based upon the variable proximity of the Au nanoparticles immobilized in the imprinted polymer, which exhibits selective binding of a given analyte accompanied by swelling that causes a blue-shift in the plasmon absorption band of the immobilized Au nanoparticles. Using adrenaline as the model analyte, it was shown that molecular imprinting effectively enhanced the sensitivity and selectivity, and accordingly, Au-MIP selectively detects the analyte at 5 \u03bcM. The combination of molecular imprinting and the Au nanoparticle-based sensing system was shown to be a general strategy for constructing sensing materials in a tailor-made fashion due to wide applicability of the imprinting technique and the independence of the sensing mechanism from the analyte recognition system.", 0, "Integrating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with other functional materials is a useful route to enhancing their performances and extending their applications. We report herein a simple encapsulation method for incorporating catalytically active Au nanoparticles with different sizes, shapes, and contents in a two-dimensional (2D) COF material constructed by condensing 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) with 2,5-dimethoxyterephthaldehyde (DMTP). The encapsulation is assisted by the surface functionalization of Au nanoparticles with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and follows a mechanism based on the adsorption of nanoparticles onto surfaces of the initially formed polymeric precursor of COF. The incorporation of nanoparticles does not alter obviously the crystallinity, thermal stability, and pore structures of the framework matrices. The obtained COF composites with embedded but accessible Au nanoparticles possess large surface areas and highly open mesopores and display recyclable catalytic performance for reduction of 4-nitrophenol, which cannot be catalyzed by the pure COF material, with activities relevant to contents and geometric structures of the incorporated nanoparticles.", "With the booming microwave and terahertz technology for communication, detection, and healthcare, the consequently increasingly complicated electromagnetic environment is in urgent need of high-performance microwave and terahertz absorption materials. However, it is still a huge challenge to achieve consecutively strong absorption in both microwave and terahertz regimes. Herein, an ultra-broadband and highly efficient absorber for both microwave and terahertz bands based on the monolithic three-dimensional cross-linked Fe3O4/graphene material (3DFG) is first reported. The 3DFG shows an incredible wide qualified absorption bandwidth (with reflection loss less than \u221210 dB) from 3.4 GHz to 2.5 THz, which is the best result in this area by far. Furthermore, the remarkable absorption performance can be maintained under oblique incidence, different compressive strains, and even after 200 compression/release cycles. The designed highly porous structure for minimizing surface reflection combined with the micro\u2013macro integrated high lossy framework results in the excellent absorptivity, as verified by the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy technique. With these, the 3DFG achieves an unprecedentedly average absorption intensity of 38.0 dB, which is the maximum value among the broadband absorbers. In addition, its specific average microwave and terahertz absorption value is over 2 orders of magnitude higher than other kinds of reported materials. The results provide new insights for developing novel ultra-broadband absorbers with stronger reflection loss and wider absorption bandwidth.", "We use all atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and dynamics of nucleosomal DNA. Our primary focus is characterization of DNA kinking as a function of position and base pair type within the nucleosome. For this purpose we have constructed 16 fully solvated all atom models of the nucleosome and subjected each to molecular dynamics simulations. Each system consists of over 200,000 atoms and is simulated for 16 ns. Combined the systems represent over 3.2 million atoms and 256 ns of nucleosome dynamics. Each system has a different sequence of DNA. The sequences chosen allow us to investigate each base pair type at each of the 147 positions in the nucleosome, as well as, each of the 16 dinucleotide steps at each of the 146 positions in the nucleosome. Within the limits of this approach we demonstrate that threading different DNA sequences onto a given histone core allows for successful initiation of molecular modeling. We also show that location within the nucleosome affects the structure and dynamics of a given base pair step type, i.e. the histones alter the DNA. However this effect is not so strong as to impose the same structure and dynamics on DNA regardless of sequence. Analysis of interaction energies demonstrates that the histone-DNA interactions vary more as a function of position than as a function of sequence. Moreover, the relative contribution from van der Waals interactions and from Coulomb interactions to the total histone-DNA interaction energy also varies with position. Thus the magnitude and the nature of the histone-DNA interactions vary with location. To analyze DNA kinking in the nucleosome we employed three definitions of kinks, included are a weak and a strong kink criteria. No single kink, by any definition, persisted for an entire 16 ns simulation. The longest continuous lifetime for an individual kink was approximately 6 ns. However, picosecond lifetimes are more typical. On nanosecond time scales kinks are self-healing, repeatedly appearing and disappearing at some locations. Kinking is not determined only by location or only by DNA sequence. Rather kinking results from a combination of the stresses imposed on DNA by the histone core and the sequence specific material properties of DNA. Both are decidedly non-uniform.", "The development of paper-based sensors, antennas, and energy-harvesting devices can transform the way electronic devices are manufactured and used. Herein we describe an approach to fabricate paper thermoelectric generators for the first time by directly impregnating naturally abundant cellulose materials with p- or n-type colloidal semiconductor quantum dots. We investigate Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities as a function of temperature between 300 and 400 K as well as in-plane thermal conductivities using Angstrom\u2019s method. We further demonstrate equipment-free fabrication of flexible thermoelectric modules using p- and n-type paper strips. Leveraged by paper\u2019s inherently low thermal conductivity and high flexibility, these paper modules have the potential to efficiently utilize heat available in natural and man-made environments by maximizing the thermal contact to heat sources of arbitrary geometry.", "This delightful book has much to offer regarding the successful teaching of science and engineering at the post-secondary level.", 0, "A series of coaxial fibers with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) as sheath and poly(tetradecyl acrylate) (PTA) comb-like polymeric phase change material as core have been prepared via an electrospinning technology with carbon nanotube (CNT) dispersed into a core component, denoted as PET/PTA-x CNT, where x is the mass fraction of CNT. The morphology, structure, and thermal performance of coaxial fibers are characterized. Good thermal stability below 300 \u00b0C is shown due to the sheath\u2013core structure for PET/PTA-x CNT coaxial fibers. Light-to-thermal conversion effect is contributed from the wide UV\u2013vis light absorbance of CNT and phase change of PTA, and PET/PTA-2% CNT reaches 60 \u00b0C after 600 s illumination under 100 mW/cm2. Furthermore, a comparable temperature variation is proved for the covered bottle with PET composite membrane containing PET/PTA-2% CNT coaxial fibers, and after 900 s illumination, the inner temperature of the bottle gets to 38 \u00b0C, which is 3 \u00b0C higher than that of the PET-covered one. The investigations of light-to-thermal conversion and thermoregulated ability of fibers guide an approach to thermal management material and greenhouse film application.", "Despite the promising potential of intracortical microelectrodes, current designs suffer from short functional lifetimes, due in large part to the neuroinflammatory response to the implanted devices. An increasing body of literature is beginning to link neuroinflammatory-mediated oxidative damage to both the loss of neuronal structures around the implanted microelectrodes, and the degradation/corrosion of electrode materials. The goal of this viewpoint paper was to summarize the current progress toward understanding the role of oxidative damage to neurons and microelectrodes. Further, we seek to highlight the initial antioxidative approaches to mitigate oxidative damage, as well as suggest how current advances in macromolecular science for various applications may play a distinct role in enabling intracortical microelectrodes as reliable choices for long-term neuroprosthetic applications.", "Nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) is a high energy capacity cathode material that attracts the interest of many research groups. Coating a protection layer on the NMC surface is one approach to improve its cycling and safety performance. However, there is no standard and consistent way to characterize the coating performance (thickness) of this protection layer, especially due to the nanoscale of primary particle and spherical morphology of the secondary particle. In this paper, a novel empirical method based on energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis at low accelerating voltage is proposed to evaluate the protection layer thickness on the scale of tens of nanometers. The layer thickness is characterized by measuring the intensity decrease of a substrate element due to absorption by overlying coating layers. An internal standard coating (metal layer) is applied to mimic the morphology influence and improve the accuracy of thickness quantitation. For the model sample evaluation, carbon layer coatings of 1 to 10 nm thickness were successfully quantified by this method.", "The aim of this study was to obtain membranes with antimicrobial activity presenting a complex sandwich-type structure. The outer layers are comprised of poly(methyl methacrylate) membranes, whereas the inner active layer consists of a modified commercial membrane to achieve antimicrobial properties. This activity arises due to the presence of silver nanoparticles in a material with a hybrid composition deposited on a commercial membrane. This hybrid material consists of polymer colloids and multiwall carbon nanotubes used for both the stabilization of the active layer by the interconnections of the polymer particles and as active component. The filtration tests revealed a good stability of the materials and an increased hydrophilicity of the hybrid membranes. The antimicrobial properties have been evaluated using Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and have been correlated with the content and migration rate of silver ions.", "A new compound Na3V3(PO4)4 is successfully synthesized for sodium ion batteries using a sol\u2013gel method. Composition analysis through ICP-OES confirms the stoichiometry of Na3V3(PO4)4. Structural analysis based on XRD reveals that the new material crystallizes in a monoclinic system with a C2/c space group. The new compound exhibits a layered structure containing 3D Na+ ion channels allowing excellent cycling and rate performance. Even at a high current rate of 3C (1C = 45 mA/g), it still delivers 82% of the theoretical capacity. Meanwhile, 92% of its capacity is retained after 100 electrochemical cycles. The voltage profiles of Na3V3(PO4)4 show that it can reversibly uptake nearly one Na+ ion with a 3.9 V voltage plateau, which is the highest value among Na-containing V-based orthophosphates ever reported.", 0, 0, "It has long been accepted that cigarette smoking causes serious disease and death, and public policy has focused on reducing tobacco use. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory jurisdiction over tobacco products since 2009, and is committed to an evidence-based approach for regulatory decision making, anchored by sound science. In an effort to generate much more data about tobacco science, the FDA has established an inter-agency partnership with the National Institutes of Health, which is making available billions of research dollars to study priority questions about tobacco science and inform FDA regulations. This new funding should attract many new researchers, creating a larger and more diverse, transparent and results-orientated tobacco science community. The FDA has set an example in acknowledging tobacco manufacturers as both important stakeholders and potential sources of valuable scientific expertise. As a result, there is a general increase in scientific publications resulting from research undertaken by tobacco industry scientists. Additionally, most tobacco manufacturers have committed to developing products aimed at being substantially less risky than cigarettes and developing the science to evaluate the potential of such products to reduce risk to individuals and the population. At the same time, there is an increase in the number of scientific journals introducing blanket bans on publishing science from tobacco manufacturers, with the British Medical Journal being a recent example. In this chapter we look at the ethical dilemmas surrounding scientific censorship and the role of peer review in protecting scientific integrity.", "The development of high-performance submucosal injection materials (SIMs) has significantly contributed to the advancement of rapid and safe endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). A previous study authored by us described that pseudoplastic fluid was more suitable for high-performance SIMs than Newtonian fluid. Herein, a novel high-performance SIM is developed, which is primarily composed of sodium polyacrylate (SPA) and exhibits pseudoplastic fluid characteristics. As a representative of current high-performance SIMs with Newtonian fluid characteristics, 0.4% sodium hyaluronate (HA) was selected as the target for comparison. Further, viscoelasticity, submucosal elevation height (SEH), and injection pressure (IP) of HA and SPA were evaluated. The results obtained by ESD were compared using HA or SPA in an ex vivo model. According to the measured viscoelasticity, the concentration of SPA was adjusted to 0.07%; this was aimed at obtaining the IP of SPA, which is equal to that of 0.4% HA. Moreover, no significant difference was observed between the IP values (31.6 \u00b1 1.7 vs 31.4 \u00b1 3.1 psi). SEHs of 0.07% SPA were higher than those of 0.4% HA at all postinjection times (P < 0.001). The duration of the ESD procedure using 0.07% SPA was significantly shorter than that obtained using 0.4% HA (16.6 \u00b1 3.7 vs 22.2 \u00b1 2.9 min, P = 0.0276); further, the total volume of the injected 0.07% SPA was significantly less than that of 0.4% HA (9.0 \u00b1 3.1 vs 15.7 \u00b1 3.9 mL, P = 0.0165). Based on rheological analysis, a high-performance SIM (0.07% SPA) with pseudoplastic fluid characteristics was theoretically developed. It was observed that the SIM performance of 0.07% SPA was higher than that of 0.4% HA.", "A series of coaxial fibers with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) as sheath and poly(tetradecyl acrylate) (PTA) comb-like polymeric phase change material as core have been prepared via an electrospinning technology with carbon nanotube (CNT) dispersed into a core component, denoted as PET/PTA-x CNT, where x is the mass fraction of CNT.

Aiming to develop a dielectric polymer with superior durability of low-k value and high thermal stability, a perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) biphenyl ether-based polyimide, PFCBBPPI, was synthesized. This polymer possesses a Tg of 310.3 \u00b0C and a 5% weight loss temperature of 510.5 \u00b0C. PFCBBBPPI exhibited an extremely low water uptake of 0.065 \u00b1 0.018%, representing the best water resistance in polyimides. The increasing percentage in k value was below 2% for PFCBBPPI film exposed to moisture under various humidity conditions for 6 h. PFCBBPPI film equilibrated at 75% R.H. for 2 weeks still kept its k value below 2.50, remarkably outperforming the Kapton film. The remarkable water resistance and resulting high durability of low-k property displayed by PFCBBPPI are originated from the hydrophobic nature and small free volume fraction of the polymer, as confirmed by contact angle test and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy results. The outstanding moisture resistance and overall performance of PFCBBPPI make it a suitable candidate for dielectric applications under both dry and humid conditions.", "We use all atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and dynamics of nucleosomal DNA.

Physical characterizations indicate that the YPO4 nanolayer has a little impact on the cathode structure. Electrochemical optimization reveals that the 3 wt % YPO4-coated LNMO could still deliver a high specific capacity of 107 mAh g\u20131 after 240 cycles, with a capacity retention of 77.5%, much higher than that of the pristine electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis proves that the rapid increase of surface impedance could be suppressed by the YPO4 coating layer and thus facilitates the surface kinetics behavior in repeated cycling. Through further material aging experiments, the improvement of electrochemical performances could be attributed to the formation of Lewis acid YF3, converted from the YPO4 coating layer in the LiPF6-based electrolyte, which not only scavenges the surface insulating alkaline species with a high acidity but also accelerates ion exchange on the material surface and thus helps to generate the solid solution Li\u2013Ni\u2013Mn\u2013Y\u2013O on the surface of YPO4-coated LNMO.", "Structure and examples of topics considered in a course on chemical engineering for high school science teachers.", "A molecularly imprinted polymer with immobilized Au nanoparticles (Au-MIP) is reported as a novel type of sensing material.

The material with flower-like architecture is composed of several nanorods that exhibit good textural properties (surface area: 120 m2/g, pore volume: 0.35 cc/g) and exposed facets and thus offers numerous electroactive sites for ion diffusion at the vicinity of electrode\u2013electrolyte. The fabricated electrode with Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4 exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 367.4 F/g compared to fabricated electrodes using NiCo2O4 (280.3 F/g) and CuCo2O4(133.5 F/g) at the current density of 1 A/g. The material also exhibits high electronic conductivity (low Rct) and impressive cycling stability (89% retention after 5000th cycle). The combination of the synergistic effect of the variable oxidation state of three metal ions, large electroactive surface area, and fast ion diffusion through the porous structure are responsible for this high performance supercapacitive property of the ternary metal oxide. An assembly of four equivalent asymmetric supercapacitors (fabricated using activated carbon as cathode and Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4 as anode) connected in series is demonstrated for powering LEDs. The fabricated device has been shown to achieve 53.08 W h kg\u20131 energy density at the power density of 700.3 W kg\u20131 and withholding the columbic efficiency of 99.6% after a 5000 cyclic runs at 5 A/g applied current density.

Sonochemistry in the true sense of the term occurs when ultrasound induces \u201ctrue\u201d chemical effects on the reaction system, such as forming free radicals which accelerate the reaction. However, ultrasound may have other mechanical effects on the reaction, such as increasing the surface area between the reactants, accelerating dissolution, and/or renewing the surface of a solid reactant or catalyst. This comprehensive review summarizes several topics of study in the sonochemical literature, including bubble dynamics, factors affecting cavitation, the effects of ultrasound on a variety of chemical systems, modeling of kinetic and mass-transfer effects, the methods used to produce ultrasound, proposed cavitation reactors, and the problems of scaleup. The objective of this paper is to present a critical review of information available in the literature so as to facilitate and inspire future research in the field of sonochemistry.", "Many surfactants aggregate spontaneously in aqueous media to form small spherical structures called micelles. Among the numerous technical applications it is known that micelles have the ability to dissolve in their hydrophobic part significant amounts of water-insoluble organic compounds. In this study we investigated through UV\u2212vis spectroscopy the micellar solubilization of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (Tcp), an intermediate product of the microbial degradation of the broad-leaf herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic (2,4,5-T). Our results show that in the presence of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate SDS the water solubility of Tcp increases six-fold whereas with cationic CTAB and nonionic Triton-X 100 the partition of chlorinated compound is not efficient. After the excess amount of the pollutant solubilized in SDS\u2212micelles has been precipitated with CaCl2 the remaining fraction of Tcp has been successfully reduced within the toxicological limit for drinkable water through a cocurrent multistage operation.

A dedicated stretching device was developed to keep notched materials under load during the NMR measurements allowing to visualize the near crack tip damage behavior in polymers. Two polymers were investigated:\u2009 ABS, a blend of poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) with 28 wt % polybutadiene, and a block copolymer poly(butylene terephthalate)/poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PBT/PTMO). MRI investigations were performed on loaded specimens with a crack grown under critical conditions as well as on unloaded specimens. Numerous damage bands appear in the images of strained ABS which converge toward the crack tip and remain present upon unloading. Image contrast is demonstrated to arise from a reduced material density in these damage bands. The material density near the crack tip is reduced to about one-fourth of the normal density. Obviously severe crazing and rubber particle cavitation occurs at the crack tip. For the PBT/PTMO block copolymer a more continuous distribution of stress induced material response is observed that disappears almost completely upon unloading. Here image contrast mainly arises from a reduction of chain mobility in soft domains due to stress induced chain orientation.", "Summary of and comments on a National Research Council report entitled \"Opportunities in Chemistry\".", "It is well known that graphene oxide (GO), a planar nanomaterial, is endowed with the capacity to immobilize short ssRNA via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, thus enhancing its stability. However, whether large RNA molecules, such as total RNA, extracted from biological tissues can be protected using GO has not been investigated. It is usually believed that the protection of total RNA by GO is not effective because the lengths of total RNA, which range from a few to thousands of bases, are inclined to undergo desorption due to their complicated structure. Herein, the nanobiological effects of total RNA/GO are first investigated and demonstrate that the total RNA can be harbored on the surface of GO, thus resulting in a shield effect. This shield effect allows total RNA to highly resist RNase degradation and maintain RNA stability at room temperature up to 4 days, enabling the discovery of GO as the potential next-generation RNase nanoinhibitor. Furthermore, GO can be conjugated to nanomagnetic beads, defined as magnetic graphene oxide, enabling the rapid purification and protection of RNA from animal cells and tissues, whole blood, bacteria, and plant tissue.", "K2Hg2Se3, a new photoconducting material with a direct band gap around 1.4 eV, was obtained in nearly quantitative yields and large scale (50 g per batch) by means of solvothermal treatment of a corresponding solid.

They are used extensively in many applications, yet their operation and limitations are not entirely understood. This work shows the advantage of using solid-state 7Li and 27Al NMR for monitoring the electrochemical properties of the doped nickel\u2013cobalt oxide cathode material, LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA), particularly during the first few charge/discharge cycles. The changes in the state of the material as lithium ions are intercalated and deintercalated during discharge and charge, respectively, are highlighted via the Li nuclei as a dynamic reporter and the Al nuclei as a static, material-embedded reporter. In particular, the NMR view of the cyclic change of Ni ions between paramagnetic and diamagnetic oxidation states is enhanced by monitoring both nuclei. Two protocols of cycling the NCA electrode are compared: one employing a smaller voltage window, cycled against graphite as anode, and one using a wider voltage window, cycled against a lithium metal anode. The NMR analysis unveils notable differences in the reversibility of the changes in the Ni oxidation states as charge carriers are shuttled in and out of the cathode material. The 27Al NMR data of the pristine material shows the existence of at least two distinct configurations of Ni ions around the Al dopant ions, suggesting coexistence of two disparate phases, which remain intact upon cycling. The protocol employing slower cycling versus Li anode delivers better cathode performance in the sense that more extensive relithiation occurs, and here, it is shown that the return of the local environments to their pristine electronic configurations is more complete. The 27Al and 7Li NMR results are integrated into a simple scheme exemplifying how better understanding of the local electronic changes in paramagnetic electrode materials can be captured in simple progressive plots.", "Titanium nitride (TiN) is an interesting refractory metallic compound which could replace gold as an alternative plasmonic material, especially for high temperature and semiconductor compatible applications. However, reported plasmonic properties of TiN films are so far limited by conventional growth techniques, such as reactive sputtering. In this work, we adopt the nitrogen-plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow single-crystalline, stoichiometric TiN films on sapphire substrates. The properties of as-grown TiN epitaxial films have been fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) interferometry. We have confirmed that MBE-grown TiN films exhibit excellent plasmonic properties to replace gold in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. Measuring the real and imaginary parts of dielectric function by SE, it is also found that TiN is better than gold in the short-wavelength range (<500 nm), where gold suffers from strong loss due to interband transition. Contrary to the recent theoretical prediction that air is not able to stabilize SPP modes at the TiN surface, our surface plasmon interferometry data clearly show the presence of propagating SPP modes at the TiN/air interface. To demonstrate the unique plasmonic properties of MBE-grown stoichiometric TiN, we have fabricated TiN metasurfaces for the visible-spectrum applications.", "A new compound Na3V3(PO4)4 is successfully synthesized for sodium ion batteries using a sol\u2013gel method.
