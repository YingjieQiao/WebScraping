{"Methyl orange adsorption comparison on nanoparticles: Isotherm, kinetics, and thermodynamic studies ": "A batch equilibrium system has been used to investigate the adsorption of methyl orange (MO) on NiO and CuO nanoparticles (NPs). The effects of experimental conditions such as initial concentration, agitation time, solution pH and temperature were examined. Langmuir and Freundlich's models were used for determining the adsorption parameters at three different temperatures. It was observed that the Langmuir model fits well with the experimental adsorption data. The pseudo first-order, second-order and intra-particle diffusion models were applied to investigate the kinetic data. The obtained results indicate that experimental kinetics data of NiO and CuO NPs were only well explained by the second-order model. It was found that the adsorption capacities of NiO NPs are higher than that of CuO NPs for each temperature. However, CuO NPs has higher adsorption rate than that of NiO NPs. The thermodynamic parameters (\u0394H\u2070, \u0394S\u2070, and \u0394G\u2070) were determined and their values indicate that the adsorptions of MO on NiO and CuO NPs are endothermic and spontaneous processes. Thermodynamics parameters also confirm that the adsorption of MO is chemical and physical adsorption on the surfaces of NiO and CuO NPs, respectively.", "Two thermally stable and AIE active 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives with red efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence ": "Red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties have been developed, based on strong electron-with-drawing 1,8-naphthalimide (NI) acceptor (A).

Experimental data indicated that the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for the dyes was higher in acidic rather than in basic solutions, and further indicated that the removal of dye increased with increase in the ionic strength of solution, this was attributed to aggregation of reactive dyes in solution. Thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption of reactive dyes onto activated carbon was an endothermic process. The adsorption enthalpy (\u0394H\n                     ads) for C.I.

What's more, probe DCM-OH exhibited an ultrafast response rate (within 5\u202fs) toward ONOO\u2212, which would be in favor of tracking the highly reactive and short-lived ONOO\u2212 in the living systems.

The bleaching rate of TPENOEt is tunable by longer wavelength light, white light irradiation and elevated temperature. The fluorescence of TPENOEt is weak in solid state, which increases obviously after grinding with a pestle accompanied by reduced photochromic efficiency and longer response time.

The axial resolution was 0.268\u202fmm, and the lateral resolution was between 0.55 and 0.59\u202fmm. The system could detect optical absorber (pencil lead) at a depth of 3.2\u202fcm and the detection limits of indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) were 9\u202f\u03bcM and 0.78\u202fmM. In vivo imaging of labeled human mesenchymal stem cells was achieved to confirm compatibility with small animal imaging. The characterization we report here may have value to other groups evaluating commercially available photoacoustic imaging equipment.", "Cardiovascular optoacoustics: From mice to men \u2013 A review ": "Imaging has become an indispensable tool in the research and clinical management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). An array of imaging technologies is considered for CVD diagnostics and therapeutic assessment, ranging from ultrasonography, X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to nuclear and optical imaging methods. Each method has different operational characteristics and assesses different aspects of CVD pathophysiology; nevertheless, more information is desirable for achieving a comprehensive view of the disease. Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging is an emerging modality promising to offer novel information on CVD parameters by allowing high-resolution imaging of optical contrast several centimeters deep inside tissue. Implemented with illumination at several wavelengths, multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) in particular, is sensitive to oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water and lipids allowing imaging of the vasculature, tissue oxygen saturation and metabolic or inflammatory parameters. Progress with fast-tuning lasers, parallel detection and advanced image reconstruction and data-processing algorithms have recently transformed optoacoustics from a laboratory tool to a promising modality for small animal and clinical imaging. We review progress with optoacoustic CVD imaging, highlight the research and diagnostic potential and current applications and discuss the advantages, limitations and possibilities for integration into clinical routine.", "PMN-PT/Epoxy 1-3 composite based ultrasonic transducer for dual-modality photoacoustic and ultrasound endoscopy ": "Endoscopic dual-modality photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound (US) imaging has the capability of providing morphology and molecular information simultaneously. An ultrasonic transducer was applied for detecting PA signals and performing US imaging which determines the sensitivity and performance of a dual-modality PA/US system. In our study, a miniature single element 32-MHz lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) epoxy 1\u20133 composite based ultrasonic transducer was developed. A miniature endoscopic probe based on this transducer has been fabricated. Using the dual modality PA/US system with a PMN-PT/epoxy 1\u20133 composite based ultrasonic transducer, phantom and in vivo animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance. The preliminary results show enhanced bandwidths of the new ultrasonic transducer and improved signal-to-noise ratio of PA and US images of rat colorectal wall compared with PMN-PT and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) composite based ultrasonic transducers.", "The integrated high-resolution reflection-mode photoacoustic and fluorescence confocal microscopy ": "A dual modality microscopy with the highest imaging resolution reported so far based on reflection-mode photoacoustic and confocal fluorescence is presented in this study. The unique design of the imaging head of the microscope makes it highly convenient for scalable high-resolution imaging by simply switching the optical objectives. The submicron resolution performance of the system is demonstrated via in vivo imaging of zebrafish, normal mouse ear, and a xenograft tumor model inoculated in the mouse ear. The imaging results confirm that the presented dual-modality microscopy imaging system could play a vital role in observing model organism, studying tumor angiogenesis and assessment of antineoplastic drugs.", "Miniaturized phased-array ultrasound and photoacoustic endoscopic imaging system ": "Visualization and detection of early-stage gynecological malignancies represents a challenge for imaging due to limiting factors including tissue accessibility, device ease of use, and accuracy of imaging modalities. In this work, we introduce a miniaturized phased-array ultrasound and photoacoustic endoscopic probe which is capable of providing structural, functional, and molecular data for the characterization of gynecologic disease. The proposed probe consists of a 64-element ultrasound phased-array transducer coupled to a fiber-optic light delivery system for co-registered ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. The fabricated US and PA imaging endoscope\u2019s diameter is 7.5\u202fmm, allowing for potential passage through the cervical canal and thus an intimate contact with gynecological tissues such as the cervical canal and uterus. The developed endoscopic probe was tested and characterized in a set of tissue-mimicking phantoms. US and PA resolutions were measured experimentally using 200\u202f\u03bcm diameter wires, resulting in apparent axial and lateral diameters of 289\u202f\u03bcm and 299\u202f\u03bcm for US, and 308\u202f\u03bcm and 378\u202f\u03bcm for PA, respectively. The probe\u2019s abilities to operate in both discrete and integrated illumination/acquisition were tested in gelatin phantoms with embedded optical absorbers with the results demonstrating the ability to acquire volumetric dual-modal US and PA images.", "Towards microvascular pressure estimation using ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging ": "Microvascular pressure drives perfusion in tissues but is difficult to measure. A method is proposed here to estimate relative pressures in microvessels using photoacoustic and ultrasound tracking of small vessels during calibrated tissue compression. A photoacoustic\u2013ultrasound dual imaging transducer is used to directly compress on tissue in vivo. Photoacoustic signals from blood vessels diminish as an external load is applied and eventually reaches a minimum or vanishes when external pressure is sufficiently greater than the internal pressure. Two methods were proposed to estimate relative pressures. In the first approach, vessels were tracked during compression and when the vessel photoacoustic signals vanished below a set threshold, the internal pressures were assigned as the external loading pressure at the respective collapse point. In this approach pressures required to collapse vessel signatures completely were found to be much greater than physiological blood pressures. An alternative approach was to track the cross-sectional area of small vessels with changing external load and fitting the data to a known Shapiro model for thin-walled vessel compression. This approach produced estimates of internal pressures which were much more realistic. Both approaches produced the same rank-ordering of relative pressures of various vessels in vivo. Approaches thus far require future work to become fully quantitative but the present contributions represent steps towards this goal.", "Photoacoustic tomography of blood oxygenation: A mini review ": "Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a hybrid imaging modality that combines rich contrast of optical excitation and deep penetration of ultrasound detection. With its unique optical absorption contrast mechanism, PAT is inherently sensitive to the functional and molecular information of biological tissues, and thus has been widely used in preclinical and clinical studies. Among many functional capabilities of PAT, measuring blood oxygenation is arguably one of the most important applications, and has been widely performed in photoacoustic studies of brain functions, tumor hypoxia, wound healing, and cancer therapy. Yet, the complex optical conditions of biological tissues, especially the strong wavelength-dependent optical attenuation, have long hurdled the PAT measurement of blood oxygenation at depths beyond a few millimeters. A variety of PAT methods have been developed to improve the accuracy of blood oxygenation measurement, using novel laser illumination schemes, oxygen-sensitive fluorescent dyes, comprehensive mathematic models, or prior information provided by complementary imaging modalities. These novel methods have made exciting progress, while several challenges remain. This concise review aims to introduce the recent developments in photoacoustic blood oxygenation measurement, compare each method\u2019s advantages and limitations, highlight their representative applications, and discuss the remaining challenges for future advances.", "Sensitivity of photoacoustic microscopy ": "Building on its high spatial resolution, deep penetration depth and excellent image contrast, 3D photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has grown tremendously since its first publication in 2005. Integrating optical excitation and acoustic detection, PAM has broken through both the optical diffusion and optical diffraction limits. PAM has 100% relative sensitivity to optical absorption (i.e., a given percentage change in the optical absorption coefficient yields the same percentage change in the photoacoustic amplitude), and its ultimate detection sensitivity is limited only by thermal noise. Focusing on the engineering aspects of PAM, this Review discusses the detection sensitivity of PAM, compares the detection efficiency of different PAM designs, and summarizes the imaging performance of various endogenous and exogenous contrast agents. It then describes representative PAM applications with high detection sensitivity, and outlines paths to further improvement.", "On the use of an optoacoustic and laser ultrasonic imaging system for assessing peripheral intravenous access ": "We describe a universal system for research in combined real-time optoacoustic (OA) and laser-ultrasonic (LU) imaging. The results of its testing on the task of needle insertion into the blood vessel model diagnostics are presented. In OA mode, where laser light is absorbed directly in the sample, the contents of blood vessel model is clearly visible. In LU mode, where the short ultrasonic probe pulse scattered on the sample is detected, the needle is clearly visible. The developed solution combining OA and LU imaging modalities due to the common detection system allowed real-time diagnostics of the position of medical needles (0.63mm and 0.7mm in diameter) inside blood vessel models (1.6mm and 2.4mm in diameter). Frame rate was 10Hz. High longitudinal spatial resolution of the system \u2212 0.1mm \u2212 allows distinguishing the two walls of the vessel model and the position of the needle inside.", "Review on practical photoacoustic microscopy ": "Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has many interesting advantages, such as deep imaging depth, high image resolution, and high contrast to intrinsic and extrinsic chromophores, enabling morphological, functional, and molecular imaging of living subjects. Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is one form of the PAI inheriting its characteristics and is useful in both preclinical and clinical research. Over the years, PAM systems have been evolved in several forms and each form has its relative advantages and disadvantages. Thus, to maximize the benefits of PAM for a specific application, it is important to configure the PAM system optimally by targeting a specific application. In this review, we provide practical methods for implementing a PAM system to improve the resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and imaging speed. In addition, we review the preclinical and the clinical applications of PAM and discuss the current challenges and the scope for future developments.", "Insights into photoacoustic speckle and applications in tumor characterization ": "In ultrasound imaging, fully-developed speckle arises from the spatiotemporal superposition of pressure waves backscattered by randomly distributed scatterers. Speckle appearance is affected by the imaging system characteristics (lateral and axial resolution) and the random-like nature of the underlying tissue structure. In this work, we examine speckle formation in acoustic-resolution photoacoustic (PA) imaging using simulations and experiments. Numerical and physical phantoms were constructed to demonstrate that PA speckle carries information related to unresolved absorber structure in a manner similar to ultrasound speckle and unresolved scattering structures. A fractal-based model of the tumor vasculature was used to study PA speckle from unresolved cylindrical vessels. We show that speckle characteristics and the frequency content of PA signals can be used to monitor changes in average vessel size, linked to tumor growth. Experimental validation on murine tumors demonstrates that PA speckle can be utilized to characterize the unresolved vasculature in acoustic-resolution photoacoustic imaging.", "Review of cost reduction methods in photoacoustic computed tomography ": "Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is a major configuration of photoacoustic imaging, a hybrid noninvasive modality for both functional and molecular imaging. PACT has rapidly gained importance in the field of biomedical imaging due to superior performance as compared to conventional optical imaging counterparts. However, the overall cost of developing a PACT system is one of the challenges towards clinical translation of this novel technique. The cost of a typical commercial PACT system originates from optical source, ultrasound detector, and data acquisition unit. With growing applications of photoacoustic imaging, there is a tremendous demand towards reducing its cost. In this review article, we have discussed various approaches to reduce the overall cost of a PACT system, and provided a cost estimation to build a low-cost PACT system.", "Photoacoustic-based oxygen saturation assessment of murine femoral bone marrow in a preclinical model of leukemia ": "A variety of hematological diseases manifest in the bone marrow (BM), broadly characterized as BM failure (BMF). BMF can be caused by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which results in an expansion of hypoxic regions in the BM. Because of this hypoxic presentation, there is potential for improved characterization of BMF through in vivo assessment of oxygenation in the BM cavity. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging can provide local assessment of intravascular oxygen saturation (SO2), which has been shown to correlate with pimonidazole-assessed hypoxia. This study introduces an optimized PA imaging technique to assess SO2 within the femoral BM cavity through disease progression in a murine model of ALL. Results show a statistically significant difference with temporal changes in SO2 (from baseline) between control and diseased cohorts, demonstrating the potential of PA imaging for noninvasive, label-free monitoring of BMF diseases.", "All-optical photoacoustic microscopy ": "Three-dimensional photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has gained considerable attention within the biomedical imaging community during the past decade. Detecting laser-induced photoacoustic waves by optical sensing techniques facilitates the idea of all-optical PAM (AOPAM), which is of particular interest as it provides unique advantages for achieving high spatial resolution using miniaturized embodiments of the imaging system. The review presents the technology aspects of optical-sensing techniques for ultrasound detection, such as those based on optical resonators, as well as system developments of all-optical photoacoustic systems including PAM, photoacoustic endoscopy, and multi-modality microscopy. The progress of different AOPAM systems and their representative applications are summarized.", "High resolution ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging of single cells ": "High resolution ultrasound and photoacoustic images of stained neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes from a blood smear were acquired using a combined acoustic/photoacoustic microscope. Photoacoustic images were created using a pulsed 532nm laser that was coupled to a single mode fiber to produce output wavelengths from 532nm to 620nm via stimulated Raman scattering. The excitation wavelength was selected using optical filters and focused onto the sample using a 20\u00d7 objective. A 1000MHz transducer was co-aligned with the laser spot and used for ultrasound and photoacoustic images, enabling micrometer resolution with both modalities. The different cell types could be easily identified due to variations in contrast within the acoustic and photoacoustic images. This technique provides a new way of probing leukocyte structure with potential applications towards detecting cellular abnormalities and diseased cells at the single cell level.", "Continuous wave laser diodes enable fast optoacoustic imaging ": "Pulsed laser diodes may offer a smaller, less expensive alternative to conventional optoacoustic laser sources; however they do not provide pulse rates faster than a few tens of kHz and emit at wavelengths only within the near-infrared region. We investigated whether continuous wave (CW) laser diodes, which are available in visible and near-infrared regions, can be good optoacoustic light sources when overdriven with a peak current >40-fold higher than the CW absolute maximum. We found that overdriven CW diodes provided \u223c10\u202fns pulses of \u223c200\u202fnJ/pulse and repetition rates higher than 600\u202fkHz without being damaged, outperforming many pulsed laser diodes. Using this system, we obtained images of phantoms and mouse ear and human arm in vivo, confirming their use in optoacoustic imaging and sensing.", "Unmixing multi-spectral photoacoustic sources in human carotid plaques using non-negative independent component analysis ": "Multi-spectral photoacoustic imaging (MSPAI) is promising for morphology assessment of carotid plaques; however, obtaining unique spectral characteristics of chromophores is cumbersome. We used MSPAI and non-negative independent component analysis (ICA) to unmix distinct signal sources in human carotid plaques blindly. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated on a plaque phantom with hemorrhage and cholesterol inclusions, and plaque endarterectomy samples ex vivo. Furthermore, the results were verified with histology using Masson's trichrome staining. Results showed that ICA could separate recent hemorrhages from old hemorrhages. Additionally, the signatures of cholesterol inclusion were also captured for the phantom experiment. Artifacts were successfully removed from signal sources. Histologic examinations showed high resemblance with the unmixed components and confirmed the morphologic distinction between recent and mature hemorrhages. In future pre-clinical studies, unmixing could be used for morphology assessment of intact human plaque samples.", "Wave front analysis for enhanced time-domain beamforming of point-like targets in optoacoustic imaging using a linear array ": "Using linear array transducers in combination with state-of-the-art multichannel electronics allows to perform optoacoustic imaging with frame rates only limited by the laser pulse repetition frequency and the acoustic time of flight. However, characteristic image artefacts resulting from the limited view and a lower SNR when compared to systems based on single-element focused transducers represent a burden for the clinical acceptance of the technology. In this paper, we present a new method for the improvement of image quality based on the analysis of the signal amplitudes along summation curves during the delay-and-sum beamforming process (DAS). The algorithm compares amplitude distributions along wave fronts with theoretical patterns from optoacoustic point sources. The method was validated on simulated and experimental phantom as well as in-vivo data. An improvement of the lateral resolution by more than a factor of two when comparing conventional DAS and our approach could be shown (numeric and experimental phantom data). For instance, on experimental data from a wire phantom, a PSF in the range of 0.18\u20130.22\u202fmm was obtained with our approach against 0.48\u202fmm for standard DAS. Furthermore, the SNR of a subcutaneous vessel 2.5\u202fmm below the skin surface was improved by about 30\u202fdB when compared to standard DAS.", "Photoacoustic tomography for human musculoskeletal imaging and inflammatory arthritis detection ": "With the capability of assessing high resolution optical contrast in soft tissues, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can offer valuable structural and functional information of human joints, and hold potential for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of inflammatory arthritis. Recent studies have demonstrated that PAI can map 2D and 3D morphology of the cartilage, synovium, vascularity, and bone tissue in human peripheral joints. Initial trials with patients affected by inflammatory arthritis have also suggested that PAI can detect the hemodynamic properties in articular tissues as well as their changes due to active inflammation. This review focuses on the recent progress in technical development of PAI for human musculoskeletal imaging and inflammation detection. PAI can provide non-invasive and non-ionizing serial measurements for monitoring of therapeutic interventions with the potential for higher sensitivity than existing imaging modalities such as ultrasound. However, further investigation is needed to validate the value of PAI in rheumatology clinical settings.", "Photoacoustic temperature imaging based on multi-wavelength excitation ": "Building further upon the high spatial resolution offered by ultrasonic imaging and the high optical contrast yielded by laser excitation of photoacoustic imaging, and exploiting the temperature dependence of photoacoustic signal amplitudes, this paper addresses the question whether the rich information given by multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) allows to obtain 3D temperature images. Numerical simulations and experimental results are reported on agarose phantoms containing gold nanoparticles and the effects of shadowing, reconstruction flaws, etc. on the accuracy are determined.", "Absorption spectra of nanodiamond aqueous dispersions by optical absorption and optoacoustic spectroscopies ": "The multispectral modality and technique for optically dense samples of optoacoustic spectroscopy were applied to measure spectra and high absorbances of concentrated aqueous dispersions of undoped nanodiamonds. The data from optoacoustic and optical transmission measurements and DSC data of the mean particle size by the Gibbs\u2013Kelvin equation are compared to estimate the difference in composition of various nanodiamond trademarks. Optoacoustic spectra confirm the contribution of surface dimer chains into the absorption of nanodiamonds in the long wavelength range. Optoacoustic and conventional absorption spectra of aqueous solutions of nanodiamond fractions after centrifugation (15300g) and ultracentrifugation (130000g) revealed a separation of a highly absorbing non-diamond sp2 phase. The two-step separation by ultracentrifugation followed by extra centrifugation made it possible to isolate a highly absorbing and soluble nanodiamond phase with the particle size of 3.6 nm, showing a change in spectra compared to the starting nanodiamond material.", "New NHC- silver and gold complexes active in A3-coupling (aldehyde-alkyne-amine) reaction ": "Silver and gold complexes bearing unsaturated N-heterocyclic carbene ligands, with unsymmetrical N-substituents and hydrogen or chlorine on backbone, have been synthetized and their efficiency tested in A3-coupling (aldehyde\u2013alkyne\u2013amine) reactions. Gold complexes showed higher activity than corresponding silver ones, even if the significant role of the backbone substituents should not be neglected. Indeed, complexes with chlorine substituted backbone were more efficient than hydrogen analogous. According to DFT calculations, electronic differences among complexes are able rationalize the different catalytic behavior, whereas steric properties play a minor part.", "Transfer-hydrogenation reactions of ketones/aldehydes in water using first generation ruthenium indenylidene olefin metathesis catalyst: One step towards sequential cross-metathesis/transfer hydrogenation reactions ": "The transfer hydrogenation reactions of various ketones/aldehydes and one-pot cross-metathesis/transfer hydrogenation (CM/TH) reactions of 10-undecenal were carried out in water media using first generation ruthenium-indenylidene complex (M1). A stable emulsion with an average particle size of 23.00 (\u00b17.20) nm was formed in water media using non-ionic (Tween 20) and cationic (dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride) surfactants in the presence of acetophenone, M1 (1%) and sodium formate, yielding corresponding alcohol derivatives in quantitative yields.\n                  The performance of M1 (5%) was tested on sequential cross-metathesis/transfer hydrogenation reaction of 10-undecenal using methyl acrylate as the cross-metathesis partner in water. The sequential CM/TH reaction of 10-undecenal was found to proceed even in tap water under air atmosphere using micellar catalyst system, giving the corresponding CM/TH product in 65% yield.", "Resource utilization of waste deNOx catalyst for continuous-flow catalysis by supported metal reactors ": "Resource utilization of waste deNOx catalysts has become a major demand. A new resource path for continuous-flow catalysis using the waste deNOx catalysts (V2O5-WO3/TiO2, CeO2-WO3/TiO2 and MnO2-CeO2/TiO2) as carriers was proposed. The waste deNOx catalysts supported NiO catalysts prepared by an in-situ preparation method were used to investigate continuous-flow nanocatalysis of p-nitrophenol reduction. The result showed that the MnO2-CeO2/TiO2 supported NiO (Ni/TMC) exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic reduction of p-nitrophenol (4-NP). The conversion of 4-NP (2.5\u2009mM) reached nearly 100% at the injection speed of 1.5\u2009mL\u00b7min\u22121. It maintained 100% conversion after 10 recycling time since waste deNOx catalysts could reduce aggregation for NiNPs. Furthermore, high oxygen vacancy, chemisorbed oxygen, and the strong interaction between Ni and waste deNOx catalyst resulted in a highly efficient, recoverable and cost-effective multifunctional reactor. All of these advantages present the opportunity to be implemented in the field of wastewater treatment and environmental toxicology.", "Industrial applications of immobilized enzymes\u2014A review ": "The use of immobilized enzymes is now a routine process for the manufacture of many industrial products in the pharmaceutical, chemical and food industry. Some enzymes, such as lipases, are naturally robust and efficient, can be used for the production of many different molecules and have a wide range of industrial applications thanks to their broad selectivity. As an example, lipase from Candida antarctica (CalB) has been used by BASF to produce chiral compounds, such as the herbicide Dimethenamide-P, which was previously made chemically. The use of the immobilized enzyme has provided significant advantages over a chemical process, such as the possibility to use equimolar concentration of substrates, obtain an enantiomeric excess > 99%, use relatively low temperatures (< 60\u202f\u00b0C) in organic solvent, obtain a single enantiomer instead of the racemate as in the chemical process and use a column configuration that allows dramatic increases in productivity. This process would not have been possible without the use of an immobilized enzyme, since it runs in organic solvent [1].\n                  Some more specific enzymes, like transaminases, have required protein engineering to become suitable for applications in production of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) in conditions which are extreme for a wild type enzyme. The process developed by Merck for sitagliptin manufacture is a good example of challenging enzyme engineering applied to API manufacture. The previous process of sitagliptin involved hydrogenation of enamine at high pressure using a rhodium-based chiral catalyst. By developing an engineered transaminase, the enzymatic process was able to convert 200\u202fg/l of prositagliptin in the final product, with e.e. >99.5% and using an immobilized enzyme in the presence of DMSO as a cosolvent [2].\n                  For all enzymes, the possibility to be immobilized and used in a heterogeneous form brings important industrial and environmental advantages, such as simplified downstream processing or continuous process operations. Here, we present a series of large-scale applications of immobilized enzymes with benefits for the food, chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetics and medical device industries, some of which have been scarcely reported on previously.\n                  In general, all enzymatic reactions can benefit from the immobilization, however, the final choice to use them in immobilized form depends on the economic evaluation of costs associated with their use versus benefits obtained in the process. It can be concluded that the benefits are rather significant, since the use of immobilized enzymes in industry is increasing.", "Cellulose conversion to ethylene glycol by tungsten oxide-based catalysts ": "The conversion of cellulose into ethylene glycol remains a significant challenge in the biobased domain. Here we explored the activity of various bulk and mesoporous (doped) tungsten oxides in combination with carbon-supported ruthenium for obtaining ethylene glycol from cellulose. Tungstite and sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxides are more active and selective than monoclinic WO3. Doping tungstite with early transition metals enhanced the rate of cellulose depolymerization to glucose through a higher Br\u00f8nsted acidity, although this did not improve the overall performance as the higher acidity resulted in a higher rate of humin formation. The increased acidity of mesoporous sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxide compared to tungstite had a similar adverse effect. Doping this material with niobium improved ethylene glycol selectivity at similar conversion. Kinetic studies showed that the majority of ethylene glycol is produced in the first hour for three optimized catalysts, with undoped bulk tungstite being the most efficient catalytic material. Impregnation of these materials with ruthenium instead of using carbon-supported ruthenium as a co-catalyst was most beneficial for tungstite, as it showed improved ethylene glycol selectivity and lower polyol yields after 1\u2009h of reaction time.", "Schiff base Cu(I) catalyst for aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols ": "We report here new copper(I)-Schiff base complexes for the selective oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes under ambient conditions (with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperdine-N-oxyl (TEMPO), N-methylimidazole (NMI), ambient air, acetonitril and RT). Particularly, the copper(I) complex bearing N-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(furan-2-yl)methanimine (L2) showed high activity in the series and gave near- quantitative yields in the oxidations of benzyl alcohol (99% yield in 1\u2009h) and 1-octanol (96% yield in 24\u2009h). Based on the X-ray structure determination, the complex has a square pyramidal coordination accomplished by two L2 ligands and bromide as a counter anion. The oxidation reactions were monitored with UV\u2013vis and in situ ATR-IR spectroscopy to study the changes in the catalytic structure and to elucidate the catalytic properties and the mechanistic details. Accordingly, detachment of one of the L2 ligands from the complexes is related to the oxidation activity."}
