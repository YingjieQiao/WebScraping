{"Microplastics in freshwaters and drinking water: Critical review and assessment of data quality ": "Microplastics have recently been detected in drinking water as well as in drinking water sources. This presence has triggered discussions on possible implications for human health. However, there have been questions regarding the quality of these occurrence studies since there are no standard sampling, extraction and identification methods for microplastics. Accordingly, we assessed the quality of fifty studies researching microplastics in drinking water and in its major freshwater sources. This includes an assessment of microplastic occurrence data from river and lake water, groundwater, tap water and bottled drinking water. Studies of occurrence in wastewater were also reviewed. We review and propose best practices to sample, extract and detect microplastics and provide a quantitative quality assessment of studies reporting microplastic concentrations. Further, we summarize the findings related to microplastic concentrations, polymer types and particle shapes. Microplastics are frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water, and number concentrations spanned ten orders of magnitude (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122 to 108 #/m3) across individual samples and water types. However, only four out of 50 studies received positive scores for all proposed quality criteria, implying there is a significant need to improve quality assurance of microplastic sampling and analysis in water samples. The order in globally detected polymers in these studies is PE\u202f\u2248\u202fPP\u202f>\u202fPS\u202f>\u202fPVC\u202f>\u202fPET, which probably reflects the global plastic demand and a higher tendency for PVC and PET to settle as a result of their higher densities. Fragments, fibres, film, foam and pellets were the most frequently reported shapes. We conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water, to better understand potential exposure and to inform human health risk assessments."}{"Continuous ozonation of urban wastewater: Removal of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and antibiotic resistance genes and phytotoxicity ": "This work evaluated the removal of a mixture of eight antibiotics (i.e. ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLA), ofloxacin (OFL), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and tetracycline (TC)) from urban wastewater, by ozonation operated in continuous mode at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (i.e. 10, 20, 40 and 60\u202fmin) and specific ozone doses (i.e. 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 gO3 gDOC\u2212 1). As expected, the efficiency of ozonation was highly ozone dose- and contact time-dependent. The removal of the parent compounds of the selected antibiotics to levels below their detection limits was achieved with HRT of 40\u202fmin and specific ozone dose of 0.125 gO3 gDOC\u2212 1. The effect of ozonation was also investigated at a microbiological and genomic level, by studying the efficiency of the process with respect to the inactivation of Escherichia coli and antibiotic-resistant E.\u00a0coli, as well as to the reduction of the abundance of selected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The inactivation of total cultivable E.\u00a0coli was achieved under the experimental conditions of HRT 40\u202fmin and 0.25 gO3 gDOC\u22121, at which all antibiotic compounds were already degraded. The regrowth examinations revealed that higher ozone concentrations were required for the permanent inactivation of E.\u00a0coli below the Limit of Quantification (<LOQ\u202f=\u202f0.01\u202fCFU mL\u2212 1). Also, the abundance of the examined ARGs (intl1, aadA1, dfrA1, qacE\u03941 and sul1) was found to decrease with increasing HRT and ozone dose. Despite the fact that the mildest operating parameters were able to eliminate the parent compounds of the tested antibiotics in wastewater effluents, it was clearly demonstrated in this study that higher ozone doses were required in order to confer permanent damage and/or death and prevent potential post-treatment re-growth of both total bacteria and ARB, and to reduce the abundance of ARGs below the LOQ. Interestingly, the mineralization of wastewater, in terms of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) removal, was found to be significantly low even when the higher ozone doses were applied, leading to an increased phytotoxicity towards various plant species. The findings of this study clearly underline the importance of properly optimising the ozonation process (e.g. specific ozone dose and contact time) taking into consideration both the bacterial species and associated ARGs, as well as the wastewater physicochemical properties (e.g. DOC), in order to mitigate the spread of ARB&ARGs, as well as to reduce the potential phytotoxicity."}{"Antibiotic resistance genes in treated wastewater and in the receiving water bodies: A pan-European survey of urban settings ": "There is increasing public concern regarding the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during wastewater treatment, their persistence during the treatment process and their potential impacts on the receiving water bodies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine the abundance of nine ARGs and a class 1 integron associated integrase gene in 16 wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents from ten different European countries. In order to assess the impact on the receiving water bodies, gene abundances in the latter were also analysed.\n                  Six out of the nine ARGs analysed were detected in all effluent and river water samples. Among the quantified genes, intI1 and sul1 were the most abundant. Our results demonstrate that European WWTP contribute to the enrichment of the resistome in the receiving water bodies with the particular impact being dependent on the effluent load and local hydrological conditions. The ARGs concentrations in WWTP effluents were found to be inversely correlated to the number of implemented biological treatment steps, indicating a possible option for WWTP management.\n                  Furthermore, this study has identified bla\n                     OXA-58 as a possible resistance gene for future studies investigating the impact of WWTPs on their receiving water."}{"Nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment processes \u2013 Origin, impact and potential solutions ": "The presence of nano and microplastics in water has increasingly become a major environmental challenge. A key challenge in their detection resides in the relatively inadequate analytical techniques available preventing deep understanding of the fate of nano/microplastics in water. The occurrence of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment plants poses a concern for the quality of the treated water. Due to their broad but small size and diverse chemical natures, nano/microplastics may travel easily along water and wastewater treatment processes infiltrating remediation processes at various levels, representing operational and process stability challenges. This review aims at presenting the current understanding of the fate and impact of nano/microplastics through water and wastewater treatment plants. The formation and fragmentation mechanisms, physical-chemical properties and occurrence of nano/microplastics in water are correlated to the interactions of nano/microplastics with water and wastewater treatment plant processes and potential solutions to limit these interactions are comprehensively reviewed. This critical analysis offers new strategies to limit the number of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater to keep water quality up to the required standards and reduce threats on our ecosystems."}{"Determinants of presence and removal of antibiotic resistance genes during WWTP treatment: A cross-sectional study ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), linking human fecal residues and the environment, are considered as hotspots for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In order to evaluate the role of WWTPs and underlying operational parameters for the removal of AMR, the presence and removal efficiency of a selected set of 6 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and 2 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) was evaluated by means of qPCR in influent and effluent samples from 62 Dutch WWTPs. The role of possible factors impacting the concentrations of ARGs and MGEs in the influent and their removal was identified through statistical analysis. ARGs and the class I integron-integrase gene (intI1) were, on average, removed to a similar extent (1.76 log reduction) or better (+0.30\u20131.90 logs) than the total bacteria (measured as 16S rRNA gene). In contrast, broad-host-range plasmids (IncP-1) had a significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) relative abundance after treatment. The presence of healthcare institutions in the area served did only slightly increase the concentrations of ARGs or MGEs in influent. From the extended panel of operational parameters, rainfall, increasing the hydraulic load of the plant, most significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) affected the treatment efficiency by decreasing it on average\u00a0\u22120.38 logs per time the flow exceeded the average daily flow. Our results suggest that overall, WWTP treatments do not favor the proliferation of the assessed resistance genes but might increase the relative abundance of broad-host-range plasmids of the IncP-1 type."}{"Spatial ecology of a wastewater network defines the antibiotic resistance genes in downstream receiving waters ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an effective barrier in the protection of human and environment health around the world, although WWTPs also are suggested to be selectors and-or reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) before entering the environment. The dogma about WWTPs as \u201cARG selectors\u201d presumes that biotreatment compartments (e.g., activated sludge; AS) are single densely populated ecosystems with elevated horizontal gene transfer. However, recent work has suggested WWTP biotreatment compartments may be different than previously believed relative to antibiotic resistance (AR) fate, and other process factors, such as bacterial separation and specific waste sources, may be key to ARGs released to the environment. Here we combined 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing and high-throughput qPCR to characterise microbial communities and ARGs across a wastewater network in Spain that includes both community (i.e., non-clinical urban) and hospital sources. Contrary to expectations, ARGs found in downstream receiving waters were not dominated by AS biosolids (RAS), but more resembled raw wastewater sources. In fact, ARGs and microbial communities in liquid-phase WWTP effluents and RAS were significantly different (Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index\u202f=\u202f0.66\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.11), with a consequential fraction of influent ARGs and organisms passing directly through the WWTP with limited association with RAS. Instead, ARGs and organisms in the RAS may be more defined by biosolids separation and biophysical traits, such as flocculation, rather than ARG carriage. This explains why RAS has significantly lower ARG richness (47\u202f\u00b1\u202f4 ARGs) than liquid-phase effluents (104\u202f\u00b1\u202f5 ARGs), and downstream water column (135\u202f\u00b1\u202f4 ARGs) and river sediments (120\u202f\u00b1\u202f5 ARGs) (Tukey's test, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). These data suggest RAS and liquid-phase WWTP effluents may reflect two parallel ecosystems with potentially limited ARG exchange. As such, ARG mitigation in WWTPs should more focus on removing bacterial hosts from the liquid phase, AR source reduction, and possibly disinfection to reduce ARG releases to the environment."}{"Lead release to potable water during the Flint, Michigan water crisis as revealed by routine biosolids monitoring data ": "Routine biosolids monitoring data provides an independent and comprehensive means to estimate water lead release pre-, during and post-Flint Water Crisis (FWC). The mass of potable plumbing-related metals (i.e., lead, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc) in sewage biosolids strongly correlated with one another during the FWC (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). A simple parametric regression model based on 90th percentile potable water lead measurements (WLL90) from five city-wide citizen science sampling efforts August 2015\u2013August 2017 was strongly correlated to corresponding monthly lead mass in biosolids [Biosolids-Pb (kg)\u00a0=\u00a00.483 x WLL90 (\u03bcg/L)\u00a0+\u00a01.79; R2\u202f=\u202f0.86, p\u202f<\u202f0.05]. Although total biosolids lead increased just 14% during the 18 months of the FWC versus the comparable time pre-FWC, 76% of that increase occurred in July\u2013September 2014, and the corresponding percentage of Flint children under 6 years with elevated blood lead \u2265 5\u202f\u03bcg/dL (i.e., %EBL5) doubling from 3.45% to 6.61% in those same three months versus 2013 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). %EBL5 was not statistically higher during the remaining months of the FWC compared to pre-FWC or post-FWC. As expected, lead in biosolids during the FWC, when orthophosphate was not added, was moderately correlated with water temperature (R2\u202f=\u202f0.30, p\u202f<\u202f0.05), but not at other times pre- and post-FWC when orthophosphate was present. Tripling the orthophosphate dose post-FWC versus pre-FWC and some lead pipe removal, decreased lead in biosolids (and %EBL5) to historic lows (2016\u20132017 vs. 2012\u20132013; p\u202f<\u202f0.05), supporting the effectiveness of these public health interventions in reducing childhood water lead exposure."}{"Diversity and antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli populations in hospital and community wastewater compared to wastewater at the receiving urban treatment plant ": "Bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns among the indicator organism Escherichia coli were monitored in wastewater samples collected over one year from a hospital (HW), a community (CW) and the receiving urban (UW) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We compared levels of antibiotic resistance in the different types of wastewater, and identified whether resistant strains were endemic in the wastewater system. If so, implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots (e.g. hospital outlets) could be used to decrease the amount of resistant bacteria in the wastewater. E.\u00a0coli from HW (n\u202f=\u202f2644), CW (n\u202f=\u202f2525) and UW (n\u202f=\u202f2693) were analyzed by biochemical phenotyping (PhenePlate System) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics (AREB System). The phenotypic diversities of the total E.\u00a0coli populations were similar for all three sites (Simpson's Diversity index, Di\u202f=\u202f0.973), however for individual samples, HW showed low diversities (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.800) and the E.\u00a0coli flora was often dominated by strains that may have originated from the fecal flora of single individuals. The diversities in CW samples was higher (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.936), and UW samples showed similar diversities as the whole collection of isolates (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.971). Resistance to at least one of the nine antibiotics was observed in 45% of the HW isolates, 44% of CW isolates, and 33% of UW isolates. Resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol was uncommon (3.2 and 5.3%, respectively), whereas resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was most common (24% and 31%, respectively). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E.\u00a0coli (ESBL-EC) were more common in HW (11.5%) and in CW (6.9%) compared to UW (3.7%). A high diversity (Di\u202f=\u202f0.974) was observed among ESBL-EC isolates from UW (n\u202f=\u202f99), indicating absence of any clonal structure among these isolates. Common PhP types of ESBL-EC often dominated in each HW sample, but were not identified across different samples, whereas ESBL-EC in CW showed low diversity (Di\u202f=\u202f0.857) and were dominated by a specific PhP type that was found across almost all CW samples. The antibiotic resistance rates were highest in hospital wastewater, but surprisingly they were also high in the studied community wastewater, compared to the urban wastewater. The relative contribution of HW seemed low in terms of dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria to the WWTP."}{"Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill: A source of microplastics? -Evidence of microplastics in landfill leachate ": "Although landfill is suspected to be releasing microplastics to the environment, there is few empirical researches carried out. To clarify suspicions of landfills as potential sources of microplastics, twelve leachate samples from four active and two closed municipal solid waste landfills were investigated. Microplastics were found in all the landfill leachate samples. In total, seventeen different types of plastics were identified in the leachate samples with calculated concentration ranging from 0.42 to 24.58 items/L. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the predominant polymer types. 99.36% microplastics were derived from the fragmentation of plastic waste buried in landfills. The size of 77.48% microplastics was between 100 and 1000\u202f\u03bcm. The study shows that the generation, accumulation and release of microplastic in landfills is a long-term process. The results of our study provide preliminary evidence and validate that landfill isn't the final sink of plastics, but a potential source of microplastics."}{"Full-scale comparison of UV/H2O2 and UV/Cl2 advanced oxidation: The degradation of micropollutant surrogates and the formation of disinfection byproducts ": "The photolysis of chlorine by UV light leads to the formation of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) as well as reactive chlorine species (RCS) that can be effective as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water treatment. Much of the research to date has been done at laboratory- or bench-scale. This study reports results from a model that demonstrates that the relative effectiveness of the UV/Cl2 AOP compared to the more traditional UV/H2O2 AOP is a function of optical path length. As such, the relative effectiveness of the two treatment options evaluated at small scale may not reflect the relative performance at full-scale, making results previously obtained at small-scale potentially less scalable. This study therefore compares the performance of UV/Cl2 to UV/H2O2 at a full-scale water treatment plant, using sucralose and caffeine as spiked surrogates for contaminants that are reactive solely to OH radicals, and to both OH and RCS, respectively. pH was varied between 6.5 and 8.0. The results demonstrated that when using a medium pressure UV lamp, UV/Cl2 might lead to approximately twice the production of OH radicals as UV/H2O2 at pH 6.5 when using the same molar oxidant concentration, but adding chlorine to the UV reactor at pH 8.0 had a negligible impact on OH radical concentration in comparison to UV alone. The study also confirmed previous small-scale results that RCS can be a major contributor to UV/Cl2 treatment for compounds such as caffeine that are susceptible to RCS, with UV/Cl2 effective at both pH 6.5 and 8.0 for such compounds. Disinfection byproducts were monitored, with adsorbable organohalide (AOX) formation increasing by approximately 10\u202f\u03bcg-Cl/L due to chlorine photolysis, but only at pH 6.5 and not at pH 8.0. This implies that UV/Cl2 might increase AOX mostly due to reaction between OH and organic precursors to make them more reactive with chlorine, and not due to RCS. The formation of specific DBPs of current or emerging regulatory interest was minimal under all conditions, except for chlorate. Chlorate yields were in the order of 6\u201318% of the photolysed chlorine."}{"Persistent contaminants as potential constraints on the recovery of urban river food webs from gross pollution ": "Urban areas contribute substantially to xenobiotic contaminant loads in rivers, but their effects have been investigated more for individual organisms and sensitive taxa, rather than through the emergent properties of communities. Here, we use replicated, catchment-scale sampling of benthic invertebrates and novel multivariate techniques to assess whether urban wastewater contaminants affected the structure and function of river food webs. We postulated that the continued occurrence of selected contaminants in river systems might explain the incomplete recovery of urban rivers from legacy gross pollution. Benthic invertebrate communities were sampled monthly over a year (2016\u20132017) at 18 sites across 3 river systems in South Wales (United Kingdom). Contaminant sources were characterised using remote sensing, water quality data from routine monitoring and measured concentrations of selected persistent xenobiotic pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers). Urban wastewater discharges had relatively limited effects on river water quality, with small increases in nitrate, phosphate, temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solids in urban systems. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in invertebrates, however, were significantly higher under greater urban land cover and wastewater discharge. Food webs at the most highly contaminated urban sites were characterised by: (i) reduced taxonomic and functional diversity; (ii) simplified food web structure with reduced network connectance; and (iii) reductions in the abundance of prey important for apex predators such as the Eurasian dipper (Cinclus cinclus). Although correlative and partially confounded by other effects, these data provide support for the hypothesis that impairment to food webs resulting from urban pollutants might explain population, community and ecosystem-level effects in urban river systems, and hence incomplete recovery from past pollution."}{"Current time-temperature relationships for thermal inactivation of Ascaris eggs at mesophilic temperatures are too conservative and may hamper development of simple, but effective sanitation ": "Ascaris eggs are commonly used as indicators for pathogen inactivation during the treatment of fecal sludge and wastewater due to their highly resistant lipid membrane and ability to survive in the environment for long periods of time. Current guidelines suggest that thermal treatment alone cannot inactivate Ascaris eggs at temperatures below 45\u202f\u00b0C, although some evidence in the literature suggests this to be incorrect. Here, we performed a controlled experiment to test the effect of mesophilic temperatures on Ascaris inactivation. We exposed Ascaris suum eggs to a temperature gradient between 34\u00b0C and 45\u202f\u00b0C under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to observe the required exposure times for a 3-log reduction. Indeed, we found that temperatures lower than 45\u202f\u00b0C did inactivate these eggs, and the required exposure times were up to two orders of magnitude shorter than suggested by current guidelines. Results from the anaerobic exposures were used to develop a time-temperature relationship that is appropriate for Ascaris inactivation at mesophilic temperatures. Data from the literature demonstrated that our relationship is conservative, with faster inactivation occurring under environmental conditions when Ascaris eggs were suspended in fecal sludge or manure. A specific aerobic relationship was not developed, but we demonstrated that aerobic conditions cause faster inactivation than anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the anaerobic relationship provides a conservative guideline for both conditions. We demonstrate that relatively low temperatures can considerably impact Ascaris viability and suggest that mesophilic temperatures can be used in waste treatment processes to inactivate pathogens. The development of safe, low-input, mesophilic treatment processes is particularly valuable for ensuring universal access to safe sanitation and excreta management."}{"Development and validation of a physiologically based kinetic model for starting up and operation of the biological gas desulfurization process under haloalkaline conditions ": "Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic and corrosive gas that must be removed from gaseous hydrocarbon streams prior to combustion. This paper describes a gas biodesulfurization process where sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) facilitate sulfide conversion to both sulfur and sulfate. In order to optimize the formation of sulfur, it is crucial to understand the relations between the SOB microbial composition, kinetics of biological and abiotic sulfide oxidation and the effects on the biodesulfurization process efficiency. Hence, a physiologically based kinetic model was developed for four different inocula. The resulting model can be used as a tool to evaluate biodesulfurization process performance. The model relies on a ratio of two key enzymes involved in the sulfide oxidation process, i.e., flavocytochrome c and sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase (FCC and SQR). The model was calibrated by measuring biological sulfide oxidation rates for different inocula obtained from four full-scale biodesulfurization installations fed with gases from various industries. Experimentally obtained biological sulfide oxidation rates showed dissimilarities between the tested biomasses which could be explained by assuming distinctions in the key-enzyme ratios. Hence, we introduce a new model parameter \u03b1 to whereby \u03b1 describes the ratio between the relative expression levels of FCC and SQR enzymes. Our experiments show that sulfur production is the highest at low \u03b1 values."}{"Towards high resolution monitoring of water flow velocity using flat flexible thin mm-sized resistance-typed sensor film (MRSF) ": "Novel flexible thin mm-sized resistance-typed sensor film (MRSF) fabricated using ink-jet printing technology (IPT) was developed in this study to monitor water flow rate in pipelines in real time in situ mode. The mechanism of MRSF is that the mm-sized interdigitated electrodes made by printing silver nanoparticles on an elastic polyimide film bend under different flow rates, leading to variation of the resistance of the sensor at different degrees of curvature. Continuous flow tests showed that MRSF possessed a high accuracy (0.2\u202fm/s) and excellent sensitivity (0.1447/ms\u22121). A model of sensor resistance and flow velocity was established to unfold the correlation between the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and the mechanic flexibility of sensor materials. An analytical model yielded a high coefficient of determination (R2\u202f>\u202f0.93) for the relationship between the resistance increment of the MRSF and the square of the flow velocity at the velocity range of 0.25\u20132\u202fm/s. Furthermore, a temperature-correction model was developed to quantify the effect of water temperature on the sensor resistance readings. MRSF exhibited a low temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR, 0.001) at the water temperature range of 20\u201360\u202f\u00b0C. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the finite element method were conducted and confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions. High-resolution monitoring of water flow rate using MRSF technology was expected to save at least 50% energy consumption for a given unit, especially under flow fluctuation. MRSF possesses a great potential to perform real-time in situ monitoring at high accuracy with ultralow cost, thus enabling the feedback control at high spatiotemporal resolution to reduce the overall energy consumption in water and wastewater systems."}{"Long-term sustainability of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in question: An economic assessment of water management alternatives ": "A dense dike system has been built in the upstream floodplains of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, allowing large scale rice production based on compartmentalized fields and optimized water management. Intensive cultivation has enabled farmers to greatly increase their rice productivity and augment the national food bowl. However, flood-control structures have undermined the water retention capacity, compromising various benefits of floodwaters for delta ecosystems. Effects are both internal and external to farming. Negative internal effects are the large investment requirements and higher farming costs. Negative externalities include increased flood damage, reduced sediment flows, saltwater intrusion and riverbank erosion. In this study, we assessed the effects of three dike\u2013agricultural system scenarios on delta-level sustainability, considering both internal and external effects. Direct and indirect costs were estimated using various methodologies and the literature. Our findings show that extensive development of high dikes on the floodplains is the least economical and most ecologically risky alternative. In this scenario, accelerated high-dike construction exacted a cost 136% greater than the situation represented by the baseline year of 2011. Externalities in this scenario contributed to rising economic losses in both aquaculture and agriculture. The scenario of transforming high-dike into low-dike systems revealed lower water management costs combined with lesser environmental impacts and greater capacity to exploit floodwater benefits. Our findings provide a useful input for decision-makers considering the unintended economic consequences of existing water management strategies. They support a transition to low-dike farming systems for a more sustainable delta."}{"Model of crop growth, water flow, and solute transport in layered soil ": "Agro-eco-hydrological models are essential for managing scarce water resources and ensuring crop productivity. Here, a one-dimensional agro-eco-hydrological model, LAWSTAC, capable of simulating water and solute transport in layered soil coupled with crop growth, is presented and validated. LAWSTAC considers eight hydraulic conductivity discretization methods to address the nonlinearity of Richards equation for soil water flow. LAWSTAC includes two root water uptake models and a flexible root distribution model for reliable transpiration simulation. Simulation of infiltration in layered soil demonstrated that the methods of arithmetic mean, geometric mean and triadic mean performed well among the eight discretization methods. The model was further verified by comparison with results from two widely used models, HYDRUS-1D and SWAP, based on the measured data in a spring wheat field for 2007 and 2008 in the Northwest China. The models produced similar results for flow in layered soil, although SWAP showed some instability in the salinity dynamics. LAWSTAC models crop growth with a more efficient parameterization than SWAP. The root mean square error for soil moisture, soil salinity concentration and LAI simulated by LAWSTAC was less than 0.06\u2009cm3\u2009cm\u22123, 3.56\u2009g L-1, and 0.43, respectively. In conclusion, LAWSTAC is suitable for simulating soil water and salinity dynamics, crop growth and their interactions."}{"Assessing the environmental sustainability of irrigation with oil and gas produced water in drylands ": "Produced water (PW) is the largest by-product of the oil and gas industry. Its management is both economically and environmentally costly. PW reuse for irrigation offers an alternative to current disposal practices while providing water to irrigators in drylands. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the environmental effects of irrigation with PW. The SALTIRSOIL_M model was used to simulate the irrigation of sugar beet with 15 PWs of a wide range of qualities in four climates of different aridity and on four contrasting soil types. The impacts on soil salinity, sodicity and pH as well as on crop yield and drainage water salinity were estimated. Well-drained soils with low water content at field capacity (Arenosol) are less sensitive to salinisation while a relatively high gypsum content (Gypsisol) makes the soil less vulnerable to both sodification and salinisation. On the contrary, clayey soils with higher water content at field capacity and lower gypsum content must be avoided as the soil structural stability as well as a tolerable soil electrical conductivity for the crop cannot be maintained on the long-term. Soil pH was not found to be sensitive to PW quality. Drainage water quality was found to be closely linked to PW quality although it is also influenced by the soil type. The impact of drainage water on the aquifer must be considered and reuse or disposal implemented accordingly for achieving sustainable irrigation. Finally, increasing aridity intensifies soil and drainage water salinity and sodicity. This investigation highlights the importance of adapting the existing irrigation water quality guidelines through the use of models to include relevant parameters related to soil type and aridity. Indeed, it will support the petroleum industry and irrigators, to estimate the risks due to watering crops with PW and will encourage its sustainable reuse in water-scarce areas."}{"Evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of continuous maize and maize and soybean in rotation in the upper Midwest U.S. ": "This study examined evapotranspiration (ET) from no-till, rainfed maize and soybean during three growing seasons (May-Sep) of normal rainfall years (2009, 2010, 2011) and a drought year (2012) in Michigan, USA, based on daily soil water uptake measured by time-domain reflectometry at multiple depths through the root zone. During normal rainfall years, growing-season ET was similar between continuous maize (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation: 471\u2009\u00b1\u200947\u2009mm) and maize in rotation (469\u2009\u00b1\u200951\u2009mm). During the drought year, ET decreased by only 3% for continuous maize but by 20% for maize in rotation. During the normal rainfall years, ET for soybean (453\u2009\u00b1\u200934\u2009mm) was statistically indistinguishable from ET for maize, and was lower during the drought year (333\u2009mm). Water use efficiency (WUE), calculated from harvest yield (grain\u2009+\u2009corn stover) and ET, was 25.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm-1 for continuous maize and 27.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121 for maize in rotation during the normal rainfall years, whereas WUEs for both continuous maize and maize in rotation were much lower in the 2012 drought year (14.0 and 15.5\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121, respectively), coincident with lower production. Soybean had a much lower WUE than maize during the three normal years (6.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121) and the drought year (4.57\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121), also explained by lower yield. Both maize and soybean tended to use all available water in the soil profile; there was no consistent difference in ET between these crops, while yield varied markedly from year to year."}{"A review of coupled hydrologic and crop growth models ": "Coupling hydrologic and crop models is becoming an increasingly important approach in the development of agro-hydrologic theme. Scientists and decision makers working to address issues in the areas of resource conservation and agricultural productivity are interested in the complementary processing of the two coupled systems. The objective of the present work is to review relevant studies related to hydrologic and crop models coupling, and to analyze the domain applicability, limitations, and other considerations."}{"Understanding clients, providers and the institutional dimensions of irrigation services in developing countries: A study of water markets in Bangladesh ": "Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated nations that nonetheless has largely achieved staple self-sufficiency. This development has been enabled in part by the rapid proliferation of small-scale irrigation pumps that enabled double rice cropping, as well as by a competitive market system in which farmers purchase water at affordable fee-for-service prices from private irrigation pump owners. Excess groundwater abstraction in areas of high shallow tube-well density and increased fuel costs for pumping have however called into question the sustainability of Bangladesh\u2019s groundwater irrigation economy. Cost-saving agronomic methods are called for, alongside aligned policies, markets, and farmers\u2019 incentives. The study assesses different institutions and water-pricing methods for irrigation services that have emerged in Bangladesh, each of which varies in their incentive structure for water conservation, and the level of economic risk involved for farmers and service providers. Using primary data collected from 139 irrigation service providers and 556 client-farmers, we empirically examine the structure of irrigation service types and associated market and institutional dimensions. Our findings demonstrate that competition among pump owners, social capital and personal relationships, and economic and agronomic risk perceptions of both pump owners and farmers significantly influence the structure of irrigation services and water pricing methods. Greater competition among pump owners increases the likelihood of pay-per-hour services and reduces the likelihood of crop harvest sharing arrangements. Based on these findings, we explore policy implications for enhancing irrigation services and irrigation sustainability in Bangladesh."}{"Assessment of meteorological and agricultural droughts using in-situ observations and remote sensing data ": "Most research on drought assessment adopted historical in-situ observations, however, there has been increased data availability from remote sensing during the recent years. This study utilizes the two sources of data in drought assessment. Using the historical in-situ observations, the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological drought were firstly investigated by calculating the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at 1, 3, 6-month time scales in Northeast China. Using remote sensing data, the combined deficit index (CDI) for agricultural drought assessment was computed based on tri-monthly sum of deficit in antecedent rainfall and deficit in monthly NDVI at land cover type and sub-type levels in the same region. In the end, the agricultural drought calculated by the CDI was evaluated against the deficit in crop yield, as well as deficit in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET), in order to verify the applicability of the CDI for agricultural drought assessment in the study region. The results showed that the CDI has better correlations with the SPEI (R2\u202f=\u202f0.48) than the SPI (R2\u202f=\u202f0.05) at 3-month scales with weight factor a\u202f=\u202f0.5 in dry farming areas. The spatial pattern of the CDI showed that the area of agricultural drought increased from July to October. In addition, a significant linear correlation was found between the CDI and anomaly in annual agricultural yield (R2\u202f=\u202f0.55), and anomaly in monthly land surface temperature (R2\u202f=\u202f0.42). The results prove that the CDI calculated by remote sensing data is not only a reliable indicator for agricultural drought assessment in Northeast China, but also provides useful information for agricultural drought disaster prevention and mitigation, and water management improvement."}{"Evapotranspiration over a rainfed maize field in northeast China: How are relationships between the environment and terrestrial evapotranspiration mediated by leaf area? ": "As a central process in the hydrological system and the climate system, terrestrial evapotranspiration is a key factor furthering our understanding of the climate change processes. Knowledge of factors controlling the variability in evapotranspiration is crucial for the prediction of the fate of terrestrial ecosystems under environmental changes. Based on long-term (2005\u20132014) eddy covariance flux data observed at a rainfed maize site in northeast China, the purpose of this study was to clarify the environmental regulation of actual evapotranspiration (ET) and the extent to which the regulatory effects on ET are directly or indirectly mediated by changes in biotic factors, using the structural equation modeling (SEM) method. The results showed that annual total ET was 397\u2009\u00b1\u200935\u2009mm for the rainfed maize site in comparison with 575\u2009\u00b1\u2009169\u2009mm of precipitation (Prec), with an ET/Prec ratio ranging from 0.43 (2012) to 1.14 (2014). It was revealed that net radiation (Rn) was the primary controlling factor of the maize ET, followed by leaf area index (LAI), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature (Ta), and soil water content (SWC). The adjusted SEM models explained 71%, 67%, and 67% of the variation in daily ET of the maize growing season (ETgs) for dry, normal, and moist years, respectively. Rn and VPD dominated ETgs in an increasing order of dry, normal, and moist years. Conversely, the effects of LAI and Ta on ETgs followed the opposite trend. This indicated that drought may increase the sensitivity of maize ET to temperature changes, and decrease the sensitivity of maize ET to radiation changes. In SEM analysis, LAI played an important mediating role in the relationship among climate, soil variables, and ETgs. Rn, VPD, Ta, and SWC all had significant indirect effects on ETgs mediated through LAI. At the annual scale, it was identified that most active days could be a robust predictor of annual ET."}{"A WEAP-MODFLOW surface water-groundwater model for the irrigated Miyandoab plain, Urmia lake basin, Iran: Multi-objective calibration and quantification of historical drought impacts ": "This study develops and applies the first coupled surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) flow model for the irrigated Miyandoab plain located in the Urmia basin, in the northwest of Iran. The model is implemented using a dynamic coupling between MODFLOW and WEAP and consists of spatially distributed monthly water balances for the aquifer, root-zone, rivers, canals, and reservoirs. Multi-objective calibration of the model using river discharge and GW level data yields accurate simulation of historical conditions, and results in better constrained parameters compared to using either data source alone. Model simulations show that crop water demand cannot be met during droughts due to limited GW pumping capacity, and that increased GW pumping has a relatively strong impact on GW levels due to the small specific yield of the aquifer. The SW-GW model provides a unique tool for exploring management options that sustain agricultural production and downstream flow to the shrinking Urmia Lake."}{"Green-blue water accounting in a soil water balance ": "It has become common practice to speak about \u2018green\u2019 versus \u2018blue\u2019 water consumption, in order to distinguish between consumption of rainwater versus groundwater or surface water. The two sources of water differ in terms of possibilities for storage and use. Whereas industrial, municipal and livestock water supply primarily depend on blue water, crop cultivation relies on both green and blue water. Discriminating between green and blue water consumption in a crop field is not straightforward: consumption refers to evapotranspiration (ET) and water contained in the harvested crop, which both appear in undifferentiated form. One cannot see which part of ET or the water in a plant originates from rainwater and which part from irrigation water. In this paper I propose a generic and physically based method to differentiate green and blue evaporation (E) and green and blue transpiration (T) by daily accounting of the fractions green and blue water in each soil and vegetation layer. The green and blue fractions of all water fluxes leaving a soil or vegetation layer in a day depend on the average green and blue water fractions in that soil or vegetation layer during that day. This method allows for an accurate assessment of irrigation efficiency (the ratio of blue water transpiration to the irrigation water applied), and for a precise estimation of green and blue water footprints of crop production (the ratio of either green ET or blue ET to the crop yield)."}{"Spatio-temporal analysis of compound hydro-hazard extremes across the\u00a0UK ": "There exists an increasing need to understand the impact of climate change on the hydrological extremes of flood and drought, collectively referred to as \u2018hydro-hazards\u2019. At present, current methodology are limited in their scope, particularly with respect to inadequate representation of the uncertainty in the hydroclimatological modelling chain.\n                  This paper proposes spatially consistent comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the identification of compound hydro-hazard hotspots \u2013 hotspots of change where concurrent increase in mean annual flood and drought events is projected. We apply a quasi-ergodic analysis of variance (QE-ANOVA) framework, to detail both the magnitude and the sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain for the mean projected mean change signal whilst accounting for non-stationarity. The framework is designed for application across a wide geographical range and is thus readily transferable. We illustrate the ability of the framework through application to 239 UK catchments based on hydroclimatological projections from the EDgE project (5 CMI5-GCMs and 3 HMs, forced under RCP8.5).\n                  The results indicate that half of the projected hotspots are temporally concurrent or temporally successive within the year, exacerbating potential impacts on society. The north-east of Scotland and south-west of the UK were identified as spatio-temporally compound hotspot regions and are of particular concern. This intensification of the hydrologic dynamic (timing and seasonality of hydro-hazards) over a limited time frame represents a major challenge for future water management.\n                  Hydrological models were identified as the largest source of variability, in some instances exceeding 80% of the total variance. Critically, clear spatial variability in the sources of modelling uncertainty was also observed; highlighting the need to apply a spatially consistent methodology, such as that presented. This application raises important questions regarding the spatial variability of hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty. In terms of water management planning, such findings allow for more focussed studies with a view to improving the projections which inform the adaptation process."}{"Flood risk and its reduction in China ": "Despite massive flood protection efforts in China, undertaken since the ancient times, disastrous floods continue to plague the country. In this paper, we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in China. First, we review published results (including our own works) on change detection in observed records of intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We provide information on essential features of extreme floods in last decades \u2013 floods on large rivers, urban floods, and flash floods. Next, we review available projections for the future (including our own results), related to intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We try to interpret the difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications. Since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large, projections have to be interpreted with caution, because of the impact on decisions related to climate change adaptation, flood risk reduction, and water resources management. We review flood risk reduction strategies in China, focusing on the present situation and division of responsibilities. China has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness, by both structural (\u201chard\u201d) defences, such as: dikes, dams and flood control reservoirs, and diversions, as well as non-structural (\u201csoft\u201d) measures: spatial planning and zoning; watershed management (source control), flood forecasting and warning systems; and awareness raising. The strategy of flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding."}{"Pore occupancy, relative permeability and flow intermittency measurements using X-ray micro-tomography in a complex carbonate ": "We imaged the steady-state flow of brine and decane (oil) at different fractional flows during dual injection in a micro-porous limestone, Estaillades, using X-ray micro-tomography. We applied differential imaging to: (a) distinguish micro-porous regions from macro-pores, and (b) determine fluid pore occupancy in both regions, and relative permeability at a capillary number, Ca\u00a0=\u00a07.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126. The sample porosity was approximately 28%, with 7% in macro-pores and 21% in pores that could not be directly resolved (micro-porosity). Fluid occupancy in micro-porosity was classified into three sub-phases: micro-pore space with oil, micro-pore space with brine, and micro-pores partially filled with oil and brine. Our method indicated an initially higher oil recovery from micro-porosity, consistent with waterflooding in a water-wet rock. The fractional flow and relative permeabilities of the two fluids were obtained from measurements of the pressure differential across the sample and the saturation calculated from the images. The brine saturation and relative permeabilities are impacted by the presence of water-wet micro-porosity which provides additional connectivity to the phases. Furthermore, we find that in addition to brine and decane, a fraction of the macroscopic pore space contains an intermittent phase, which is occupied either by brine or decane during the hour-long scan time. Pore and throat occupancy of oil, brine and intermittent phase were obtained from images at different fractional flows using the generalized pore network extracted from the image of macro-pores. The intermittent phase, where the occupancy fluctuated between oil-filled and brine-filled, was predominantly located in the small and intermediate size pores and throats. Overall, we establish a new experimental methodology to: (i) quantify initial and recovered oil in micro-pores, (ii) characterise intermittent flow, and (iii) measure steady-state relative permeability in carbonates, which is shown to be greatly influenced by micro-porosity."}{"Assessing seasonal drought variations and trends over Central Europe ": "The relevance of drought is still often underestimated for temperate climate regions like Central Europe that are characterized by on average ample precipitation. Nonetheless, several drought events in recent years (e.g. 1992, 2003, 2015 and 2018) demonstrated that droughts are a relevant factor for several economic activities (e.g., agriculture, water dependent industries, energy supply, etc.) in Central Europe. This is particularly true for the vegetation period, where increasing evapotranspiration rates due to rising atmospheric temperatures are intensifying existing drought conditions that originally developed from rainfalls deficits. The contribution of this study is an assessment of the long-term variability of drought conditions and seasonal climate trends within 1951\u20132015 based on a collective of 91 climate stations from the national meteorological services of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. Using a set of eight drought and three heavy precipitation indices an aggregated evaluation of seasonal precipitation characteristics is done and the driest seasons are identified for the entire study area as well as for four sub-regions. It is shown that the choice of the study period matters (1951\u20132015 vs. 1961\u20132015) as the pronounced (multi-)decadal variability of drought conditions restricts the temporal stability of computed trends. The drought trends computed for 1951\u20132015 are similar in direction, but generally smaller in magnitude than those of the ten year shorter period 1961\u20132015, as the 1950s have been a very dry decade in Central Europe. Seasonally, drying trends were observed for spring and less pronounced for summer, while autumn and winter show wetting trends. The seasonal trends are sensitive to shifts in the season definition by one month. Vegetation period I (VP-I) shows stronger drying trends, but less increases in heavy precipitation than spring, while the drought trends are less pronounced in vegetation period II (VP-II) as compared to the summer season, but more trends towards heavy precipitation increases occur in VP-II. These differences are explained by the daily trends in the seasonal cycle that show the strongest drying in April, June and the beginning of August and the strongest wetting in March and September. Generally, heavy precipitation increases prevail over decreasing trends in all seasons, whereby stations with strong drought trends generally have smaller positive or even negative heavy precipitation trends. A simultaneous occurrence of drought and heavy precipitation increases is observed in spring at several stations, particularly in sub-region West."}{"(Multi)wavelets increase both accuracy and efficiency of standard Godunov-type hydrodynamic models ": "This paper presents a scaled reformulation of a robust second-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) solver for the Shallow Water Equations (SWE), with guiding principles on how it can be naturally extended to fit into the multiresolution analysis of multiwavelets (MW). Multiresolution analysis applied to the flow and topography data enables the creation of an adaptive MWDG2 solution on a non-uniform grid. The multiresolution analysis also permits control of the adaptive model error by a single user-prescribed parameter. This results in an adaptive MWDG2 solver that can fully exploit the local (de)compression of piecewise-linear modelled data, and from which a first-order finite volume version (FV1) is directly obtainable based on the Haar wavelet (HFV1) for local (de)compression of piecewise-constant modelled data. The behaviour of the adaptive HFV1 and MWDG2 solvers is systematically studied on a number of well-known hydraulic tests that cover all elementary aspects relevant to accurate, efficient and robust modelling. The adaptive solvers are run starting from a baseline mesh with a single element, and their accuracy and efficiency are measured referring to standard FV1 and DG2 simulations on the uniform grid involving the finest resolution accessible by the adaptive solvers. Our findings reveal that the MWDG2 solver can achieve the same accuracy as the DG2 solver but with a greater efficiency than the FV1 solver due to the smoothness of its piecewise-linear basis, which enables more aggressive coarsening than with the piecewise-constant basis in the HFV1 solver. This suggests a great potential for the MWDG2 solver to efficiently handle the depth and breadth in resolution variability, while also being a multiresolution mesh generator. Accompanying model software and simulation data are openly available online."}{"Flow and bed morphology response to the introduction of wood logs for sediment management ": "Submerged vanes alter sediment transport by inducing a secondary circulation without significantly compromising the conveyance capacity of the river. Here, a laboratory study is conducted to investigate whether wood logs or trunks can be used for sediment management. The effectivity of a traditional vane field is compared to set-ups with screens of stacked logs, and large individual trunks. Results indicate that all three set-ups redistribute sediment but that the trunks are least effective in inducing a secondary circulation and cause higher turbulence and drag, leading to a stronger decrease in streamwise velocity. We conclude that a field of trunks acts as a sediment trap because of a strong reduction of the streamwise velocity, without a strong secondary flow such as dominant in the other configurations. Screens of stacked logs can be successfully implemented in rivers, as they are only slightly less effective than traditional vanes. The risk of piping underneath objects and the associated scour are points of concern."}{"Relational analysis of the resource nexus in arid land crop production ": "While a large number of descriptive studies have delineated the interlinkages between water, food and energy resources in the last decade, there is still need for systematic conceptualization of resource nexus interconnections. This paper proposes a theory of relational analysis of the nexus based on the analytical concept of nexus networks. A taxonomy of nexus interconnections, detailing sequential and hierarchical connections, is characterized between and amongst the technosphere and biosphere. We illustrate the use of a novel diagnostic tool with regard to its ability to integrate macro-, meso- and microscale drivers of nexus problems. We apply this framework to problems generated by intensive crop production for exportation in an arid landscape (driven by external markets) and sustainable management of water resources (driven by public policies) in a southern Spanish region. We elucidate interconnected causal mechanisms for groundwater overexploitation and profile different social-ecological patterns on a spatially-explicit basis. The proposed approach is capable of accounting for the water-energy-food resource nexus in an integrated and multi-level fashion, addressing the tensions generated by both multi-functionality and resource entanglement in complex social-ecological systems."}{"An argument-driven classification and comparison of reservoir operation optimization methods ": "Reservoir operation optimization aims to determine release and transfer decisions that maximise water management objectives such as ensuring a reliable water supply, hydropower production, mitigation of downstream floods, etc. An extensive and growing body of scientific literature exists on advancing and applying mathematical optimization methods to reservoir operation problems. In this paper, we review such literature according to a novel classification system of optimization approaches, which focuses on the characteristics of the actual operation problem \u2013 i.e. what needs to be optimized, or in mathematical terms, \u2018the argument\u2019 of the optimization problems - rather than the mathematical properties of the optimization algorithm. This enables us to discuss the advantages, limitations and the scope of application of the different optimisation methods; and to provide practical guidelines for matching the properties of a system and operation problem with a suitable optimization method. Alongside this paper we provide code to implement many of the methods we review for an illustrative reservoir system."}{"Real-time simulation of surface water and groundwater with data assimilation ": "Data assimilation (DA) has proven to be a useful technique in real-time hydrological modeling and forecasting. Jointly assimilating both surface water and groundwater data has promising application value for hydrological simulations in areas where surface water and groundwater are closely linked; however, such studies have not been intensively reported. In addition, the role of the quality of precipitation forecast has not been fully addressed in real-time forecasting using a coupled surface water - groundwater model, where the model evaluation includes both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. In the present study, we use the MIKE SHE hydrological model code in conjunction with the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter DA technique. The study area is a small urbanized catchment in Denmark. The model is run in simulated real-time using historical numerical weather prediction forecasts. The results show that DA can significantly reduce model bias and thereby improve model performance for both surface water and groundwater simulations. Comparing the impact of DA and rainfall forecast quality, it is found that, for streamflow forecasts, the most important factor is the quality of the rainfall data; whereas for groundwater head forecasts, the initial state at time of forecast is more important. We also find that inclusion of rainfall forecast uncertainty may be important for simulating a single event, however, it is not vital if long-term average model performance is of interest."}{"A generalized framework for process-informed nonstationary extreme value analysis ": "Evolving climate conditions and anthropogenic factors, such as CO2 emissions, urbanization and population growth, can cause changes in weather and climate extremes. Most current risk assessment models rely on the assumption of stationarity (i.e., no temporal change in statistics of extremes). Most nonstationary modeling studies focus primarily on changes in extremes over time. Here, we present Process-informed Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis (ProNEVA) as a generalized tool for incorporating different types of physical drivers (i.e., underlying processes), stationary and nonstationary concepts, and extreme value analysis methods (i.e., annual maxima, peak-over-threshold). ProNEVA builds upon a newly-developed hybrid evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for numerical parameters estimation and uncertainty assessment. This offers more robust uncertainty estimates of return periods of climatic extremes under both stationary and nonstationary assumptions. ProNEVA is designed as a generalized tool allowing using different types of data and nonstationarity concepts physically-based or purely statistical) into account. In this paper, we show a wide range of applications describing changes in: annual maxima river discharge in response to urbanization, annual maxima sea levels over time, annual maxima temperatures in response to CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, and precipitation with a peak-over-threshold approach. ProNEVA is freely available to the public and includes a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance its implementation."}{"Sustainable development in cities: Studying the relationship between groundwater level and urbanization using remote sensing data ": "Sustainable urban development has been one of the main concerns for policy-makers and increasing rate of population and urbanization have resulted in several socio-environmental impacts on people. Hence, water resources management in cities, as one of the most vital strategies, has become more complicated and challenging. In this study, the impact of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater level fluctuations was assessed. Using remote sensing data from different satellites and missions, data of water storage mass, precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, land cover etc. was extracted and processed by employing different programming languages and mapping tools. Atlanta metro area in Georgia, USA was selected as the case study location and the potential impacts of urban development in this city on groundwater resources were studied. The results suggest that from 2001 to 2013, limited urban development has happened in Atlanta; while this urbanization rate was more intense during previous decades and is predicted to be increased by 2050. Therefore, although other land cover types may be more correlated, results of correlating groundwater level with urban land cover is inconclusive for Atlanta metro area. Nonetheless, since relationship between urbanization and GW level variations is undeniable, novel methodology of this study can be employed for other fast-growing cities, especially in China and India."}{"Quality and health risk assessment of shallow groundwater aquifers within the Atankwidi basin of Ghana ": "This study has appraised groundwater suitability for drinking and irrigation, and its potential health risk to humans within the Atankwidi basin of Ghana. Twenty-six boreholes were sampled and their physicochemical and heavy metal constituents determined to evaluate the groundwater potability from water quality index computations. Chlorinity, salinity, permeability indices, sodium adsorption ratio, residual bicarbonate and magnesium hardness were also computed to assess the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation. More so, the hazard quotient, hazard index and cancer risk of analyzed heavy metals were estimated to assess their potential carcinogenic risk to human health. The results showed that four and nine samples had concentrations of As, Zn and Pb exceeding respective WHO recommended limits of 0.001\u202fmg/L, 0.006\u202fmg/L and 0.01\u202fmg/L. Fluoride levels in four samples exceeded the maximum WHO limit of 1.5\u202fmg/L whilst two samples were below the minimum limit of 0.5\u202fmg/L. Water quality indices revealed that about 80% of groundwaters were potable. Compared to adults, children were more than twice vulnerable to potential carcinogenic effects over a life-time through dermal and ingestion exposures. The groundwater was generally found to be suitable for irrigation, especially for moderate salt-tolerant crops such as maize, millet, sorghum, pepper, tomatoes, cabbage, etc. To minimize potential exposure to carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks, there should be awareness creation to stop the use of agro-chemicals for farming be avoided."}{"Potential heavy metal pollution of soil and water resources from artisanal mining in Kokoteasua, Ghana ": "Effluents and mine waste from artisanal mining in Kokoteasua, a community in Ghana, are discharged directly to the environment without prior treatment and have the potential of polluting the soil and water resources that the populace rely on for their daily water need. Therefore, this study has assessed the impact of the artisanal mining activities on the soil and water resources in the community. The method employed involved mapping the water supply points in the community and sampling the water supply points and the soil (at 20 cm and 40 cm depths) to determine their heavy metal levels (i.e. Fe, Pb, Zn, As, Mn, Cu, and Hg). The water quality was assessed using the World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline values for drinking water while pollution indices were used to evaluate the levels of soil pollution. The results, generally, indicated that groundwater in the community is potable but unsuitable for drinking in isolated locations due to high levels of As and Zn. The stream, however, recorded high levels of Mn, Fe, and pH above the acceptable WHO drinking water guidelines. Again, the study found the soil to be extremely polluted with all the measured heavy metals (except Hg) from contamination factor, enrichment factor, geo-accumulation index and pollution load index assessments. Thus, the artisanal mining needs to be regulated to protect the water resource and soil from further pollution."}{"Impact of Municipal Solid Waste Landfill leachate on groundwater quality in Varanasi, India. ": "This study assesses the impact of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill leachate on its surrounding groundwater quality of village Ramna, Varanasi, India. Leachate pollution index (LPI) of landfill leachate was evaluated with their physicochemical analysis that represents the overall leachate pollution potential and hazardous nature of MSW leachate. Physicochemical analysis of groundwater quality around the landfill site does not favour to drinking and domestic purposes as per the WHO and BIS standard. A considerable amount of NO3\n                     \u2212, PO4\n                     3\u2212, Fe, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS) were found in the groundwater samples near to the landfill site especially during post-monsoon, indicating that groundwater quality is being significantly affected by leachate percolation. Factor analysis signifies positive loading of most of the toxic pollutant that presenting MSW leachate impact on groundwater quality. WQI results also revealed that most of the groundwater samples were deteriorated from good and excellent water quality in pre-monsoon to fair water quality in post monsoon near the landfill site. Groundwater flow modeling simulation also showing that increase in the hydraulic head during the post-monsoon responsible for the downward flow of leachate pollutants from the landfill site. This Study suggests an urgent need for the sanitary landfill to control and minimize the impact of MSW leachate on groundwater quality around the Raman MSW landfill site."}{"Ion exchanges process for calcium, magnesium and total hardness from ground water with natural zeolite ": "Presence of hardness ions in the municipal drinking water is the major health concern. So to minimize the hardness of drinking water up to the environmental protection authority (EPA) quality standard expensive treatments are available. This directly affects the rural and low community society. The aim of this research work is to remove the calcium, magnesium and total hardness from the municipal drinking water supply with natural zeolite. All the experiments on the research work were carried out in batch method. The experimental result illustrates that at 2M NaCl and 60\u202f\u00b0C activation temperature is suitable to achieved maximum 80.2% calcium, 84.8% magnesium and 81.0% total hardness at optimum condition pH 6.9, dose 50\u202fg/L, particle size 1\u202fmm, treatment time 30\u202fmin and experimental temperature 25\u202f\u00b0C. Regeneration of zeolite at 3M NaCl and 90\u202f\u00b0C is appropriate to achieve 80.0% total hardness, 79.9% Ca ions, 85.6% Mg ion at pH 6.9, size 1\u202fmm and regeneration time 15\u202fmin. The X-ray diffraction, scanning electron micrograph and Fourier infrared transfer analysis confirms that zeolite has participated on hardness removal. Overall zeolite is highly efficient for hardness removal and can be employed in the drinking water treatment plant."}{"Modeling groundwater level fluctuations in Tehran aquifer: Results from a 3D unconfined aquifer model ": "Heavy groundwater withdrawal results in aquifer compaction and increases the risk of land subsidence hazard with significant economic, environmental, and social consequences. Having an accurate model for hydraulic pressure loss and groundwater level changes is one of the crucial factors in proper modeling and evaluation of land subsidence hazard. This paper investigates dynamics of groundwater variations in Tehran aquifer. By analyzing a comprehensive geological and hydrological data such as alluvium depths, hydraulic conductivity, piezometric measurements, and pumping well information, we model the hydraulic heads and evaluate the hydraulic conductivity. For validation of the model, groundwater level changes resulting from the model are compared with piezometric measurements for the period 2006\u20132011. The comparison shows a good consistency between the predicted and observed hydraulic head values with the maximum absolute error of less than 7\u202fm and RMS error of about 5\u202fm, that is about 2% error, considering that the hydraulic head values are between 850 and 1250\u202fm. This shows the capability and accuracy of the proposed model to simulate and predict the aquifer hydraulic head distribution and its changes. The model also indicates high hydraulic conductivity in the northern and central parts of Tehran Plain, which is attributed to the river sedimentation there."}{"Arsenic concentration in groundwater: Archetypal study from South Africa ": "South Africa does not have significant surface water resources, which is often easily affected by unpredictable and rapidly changing climatic variables, due to its location in the arid and semi-arid climatic setting. In large part of the country, groundwater from weathered and fractured crystalline rocks plays pivotal role in sustaining the livelihood, often it contains toxic metals released from the host rocks. The host rocks that are responsible for arsenic release in groundwater are primarily enriched due to metamorphism and igneous processes that resulted in the enrichment of economic minerals. Preliminary assessment indicates that the main arsenic containing minerals are arsenopyrite (FeAsS), arsenical oxide, sulpharsenide, arsenopyritical reefs, leucopyrite, l\u00f6llingite (FeAs2) and scorodite (FeAsO4\u00b72H2O). Owing to the release of arsenic from highly mineralized rocks that constitute the aquifers, arsenic concentration in the groundwater reaches up to 253\u202f\u03bcg/L (Namaqualand), 6150\u202f\u03bcg/L (west of Johannesburg), about 500\u202f\u03bcg/L in the Karoo aquifers, considerably higher than the WHO guideline value of 10\u202f\u03bcg/L. Acid mine drainage from coal and gold mining is also found to be an important source of arsenic and other toxic metals in groundwater."}{"Assessment of groundwater quality for irrigation of green spaces in the Rourkela city of Odisha, India ": "For the health of the city dwellers the development of green spaces is imperative. Sustenance of such green spaces is directly controlled by the water quality. Steel City Rourkela in Odisha State of India, lying between 84.54\u00b0E longitude and 22.12\u00b0N latitude, has green spaces whose existence depends on the groundwater quality. The quality of 25 groundwater samples in the Rourkela city was evaluated for examining their suitability for irrigation purpose in order to sustain green spaces in the city. The assessment was completed using pH, Electrical Conductivity, Total Hardness, Sodium Absorption Ratio, Na %, Residual Soluble Carbonate, Residual Sodium Bicarbonate, Permeability index, Potential Salinity, Magnesium hazard, Magnesium/Calcium ratio, Kelley's ratio and indices of base exchange. Data plot dispositions on Gibb's diagram indicated that the chemistry of groundwater of the area is controlled by rock composition. Most of the samples with negative chloro-alkaline indices values suggested the predominance of chloro-alkaline disequilibrium process in the groundwater system. Data plot disposition on U.S. Salinity hazard diagram indicates that 11 and 14 samples belong to C2S1 and C1S1, illustrating medium salinity/low sodium type and low salinity/low sodium type, respectively. There was difference in the groundwater samples from Urban, Rurban and Rural setup of the region with respect to some parameters/indices. The spatial variability of the physico-chemical parameters suggests that the groundwater of Chhend colony, Civil Township, Sector 21, Uditnagar and Bandamunda are most suitable for irrigation, in contrast to that of Koel Nagar, Shaktinagar, Basanti Colony and northwest part of Jagda-Jhirpani area. With the surface water scarcity in the region the groundwater at some sites of the city can be used for maintenance of green spaces."}{"Comparison among influencing factor, frequency ratio, and analytical hierarchy process techniques for groundwater potential zonation in Vaitarna basin, Maharashtra, India ": "Groundwater is a hidden natural resource which plays a crucial role in all the environmental and biological processes with a greater significance on socio-economic activities. However, the nature of groundwater is dynamic and highly variable from place to place. Therefore, for sustainable development and management, accurate location based groundwater potential mapping is critical in arid and semi-arid regions. This study demonstrates the proficiency of three decision making approaches, viz., influencing factors (IF), frequency ratio (FR), and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques in groundwater potentiality mapping. A total eight parameters such as lithology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density, land-use, lineament density, rainfall, soil texture, and soil depth are assessed through satellite and conventional data sources. Weights are assigned to all these parameters and their sub parameters to perform influencing factor and AHP models, based on existing knowledge. Frequency ratio is performed by calculation of the ratio between the number of wells availability on a category to the total area of each factor. Three resultant maps are prepared by integrating all these parameters and their corresponding weights in GIS environment. The validation results exhibit that the map produced using FR model is more efficient (75% accuracy) compared to the IF (71% accuracy) and AHP techniques (70% accuracy). Based on this study it is concluded that the frequency ratio model is more reliable for the assessment of groundwater potential. However, the groundwater potential maps prepared in this study will be helpful for effective planning and groundwater management in Vaitarna basin."}{"Groundwater as a social-ecological system: A framework for managing groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States ": "Groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States is a critical source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities. Groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations, climate change and climate variability. Many groundwater systems in the region have been inappropriately managed, with increasing occurrences of groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion. This limits the availability of freshwater, increases the likelihood of contracting water borne diseases, and the cost of access to alternative freshwater sources. In this paper, we argue that groundwater systems are social-ecological systems, where anthropogenic activities and groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic, non-linear processes. We also argue that groundwater management failures in the region, are associated with traditional command and control approaches to management, which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and ecological groundwater systems; and assumes that groundwater resources, and the dependant human communities can be managed independently. Recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant social communities is important for the long-term sustainability of groundwater in these regions. Conceptual frameworks are useful tools to order phenomena and material, revealing patterns and processes, and enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single conceptual-empirical structure. We propose a framework to manage groundwater as a social-ecological system. The framework is comprised of three building blocks: complex adaptive systems, resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management. We discuss how the application of the framework in the Republic of Nauru may alter decades of groundwater mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path."}{"A Customized FuzzyAHP - GIS based DRASTIC-L model for intrinsic groundwater vulnerability assessment of urban and peri urban phreatic aquifer clusters ": "The groundwater vulnerability analysis addresses the degree of sensitivity of groundwater system towards changes in both intrinsic/inherent and extrinsic factors. With this aim, an integrated FAHP-GIS-based modified DRASTIC (DRASTIC-L) method was followed in order to address the response of various hydro-geological indicators towards attenuation of pollutant to sub-surface hydrological regime in two differently urbanized clusters of Kozhikode district in Kerala, Southern India. Rating for the DRASTIC-L factors was derived with the aid of Fuzzy based Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP). Spatial and non-spatial information was integrated into a GIS environment. The resultant spatial data thus generated depicted that about 71% of urban and 22% of peri-urban zones of the study area, which are characterised by porous and permeable vadose media with shallow groundwater table, have a high to very high vulnerability index value. Majority of highly vulnerable urban area extends 0\u201310\u202fkm from the coastal line and has a dense population. Of the total study area, 8% urban and 38.5% of peri-urban area with low index value indicated that the groundwater in the zone is protected from contaminant's leaching due to its inherent hydrogeology. Low porous vadose media and the presence of steep slope terrain favors this low vulnerability. Besides the remaining area shows moderate vulnerability to contamination. Single - parameter and map-removal sensitivity analyses highlighted that vadose zone characteristic has the highest influence on vulnerability assessment. The resultant vulnerability index values validated with composite groundwater quality index data depicted the significant correlation among them. Thus, the groundwater vulnerability index map is an efficient tool for water-sensitive urban development."}{"Hydrogeochemical characteristics with respect to fluoride contamination in groundwater of Maheshwarm mandal, RR district, Telangana state, India ": "Groundwater samples were collected in Maheshwaram mandal, Ranga Reddy district, Telangana State, India for two seasons (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon) and analyzed for chemical parameters with respect to fluoride. The fluoride concentration ranges from 0.31 to 3.03\u202fmg/l and 0.28\u20132.58\u202fmg/l during pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) seasons respectively. Results showed that water samples were contaminated with presence of fluoride ion. High fluoride concentration recorded during PRM 62% and POM 38% when compared with World Health Organization tolerance limit of 1.5\u202fmg/l. The higher ratio of Na/Ca indicates dissolution of fluoride minerals at higher pH and the HCO3/Ca ratio indicate the condition favoring to dissolution of fluoride ions. Hydrogeochemical facies distribution indicates water-rock interaction resulted in occurrence of high fluoride concentration in groundwater. Analytical results plotted on Gibb's diagram indicate rock and evaporation dominance. Principal component analysis indicates hydrogeochemical processes like weathering, ion exchange, and anthropogenic activities contribute to groundwater chemistry."}{"Performance assessment of two-dimensional hydraulic models for generation of flood inundation maps in mountain river basins ": "Hydraulic models for the generation of flood inundation maps are not commonly applied in mountain river basins because of the difficulty in modeling the hydraulic behavior and the complex topography. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of four two-dimensional hydraulic models (HEC-RAS 2D, Iber 2D, Flood Modeller 2D, and PCSWMM 2D) with respect to the generation of flood inundation maps. The study area covers a 5-km reach of the Santa B\u00e1rbara River located in the Ecuadorian Andes, at 2330 masl, in Gualaceo. The model's performance was evaluated based on the water surface elevation and flood extent, in terms of the mean absolute difference and measure of fit. The analysis revealed that, for a given case, Iber 2D has the best performance in simulating the water level and inundation for flood events with 20- and 50-year return periods, respectively, followed by Flood Modeller 2D, HEC-RAS 2D, and PCSWMM 2D in terms of their performance. Grid resolution, the way in which hydraulic structures are mimicked, the model code, and the default value of the parameters are considered the main sources of prediction uncertainty."}{"Correlations between silt density index, turbidity and oxidation-reduction potential parameters in seawater reverse osmosis desalination ": "The reverse osmosis method is one of the most widely used methods of seawater desalination at present. Hydrophilic and desalting membranes in reverse osmosis systems are highly susceptible to the input pollutants. Various contaminants, including suspended organic and inorganic matter, result in membrane fouling and membrane degradation. Fundamental parameters such as the turbidity, the amount of chlorine injection, and silt density index (SDI) are the most predominant parameters of fouling control in the membranes. In this study, the operation system included a water intake unit, a pretreatment system, and an RO system. The pretreatment system encompassed a clarifier, a gravity sand filter, pressurized sand filters, and a cartridge filter. The correlation between the amount of chlorine injection in terms of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and the SDI value of the input water was investigated at a specified site next to the Persian Gulf. The results showed that, at certain intervals of inlet turbidity, injection of a certain amount of chlorine into the raw water has a distinct effect on the decrease of SDI."}{"Using multi-satellite microwave remote sensing observations for retrieval of daily surface soil moisture across China ": "The objective of this study was to retrieve daily composite soil moisture by jointly using brightness temperature observations from multiple operating satellites for near real-time application with better coverage and higher accuracy. Our approach was to first apply the single-channel brightness radiometric algorithm to estimate soil moisture from the respective brightness temperature observations of the SMAP, SMOS, AMSR2, FY3B, and FY3C satellites on the same day and then produce a daily composite dataset by averaging the individual satellite-retrieved soil moisture. We further evaluated our product, the official soil moisture products of the five satellites, and the ensemble mean (i.e., arithmetic mean) of the five official satellite soil moisture products against ground observations from two networks in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, China. The results show that our product outperforms the individual released products of the five satellites and their ensemble means in the two validation areas. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of our product were 0.06 and 0.09\u00a0m3/m3 in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. Relative to the ensemble mean of the five satellite products, our product improves the accuracy by 9.1% and 57.7% in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. This demonstrates that jointly using brightness temperature observations from multiple satellites to retrieve soil moisture not only improves the spatial coverage of daily observations but also produces better daily composite products."}{"Evaluation of copper removal efficiency using water treatment sludge ": "Large quantities of sludge are produced during water treatment processes. Recently, sludge has been treated as waste and disposed of in landfills, which increases the environmental burdens and the operational cost. Therefore, sludge reuse has become a significant environmental issue. In this study, adsorption of copper ions (Cu2+) onto calcined sludge was investigated under various operational conditions (with varying temperature, Cu2+ initial concentration, pH, and sludge dosage). The prepared sludge material was characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. The sorption capacity of sludge was directly proportional to the initial Cu2+ concentration and inversely proportional to the sludge dosage. The optimum operational pH and solution temperature were 6.6 and 80\u00b0C, respectively. The experimental results followed a Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-first-order adsorption kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters such as activation energy, change in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy were calculated. Thermodynamic analyses indicated that the sorption of copper ions onto the calcined sludge was driven by a physical adsorption process. The prepared sludge was proven to be an excellent adsorbent material for the removal of Cu2+ from an aqueous solution under optimum conditions."}{"River bank protection from ship-induced waves and river flow ": "A new equation is proposed for the design of armor units on protected river banks under the combined action of ship-induced waves and river flow. Existing observed field and experimental data in the literature have been examined and a valuable database has been developed. Different conditions, including the river water depth, flow velocity, river bank slope, Froude number, wave height, wave period, and wave obliquity have been considered. Results from an empirical equation (Bhowmik, 1978) that only considers the maximum wave height and river bank slope have been compared with the results calculated by the newly developed equation. Calculated results have also been verified against field data. Results show that not only the maximum wave height and river bank slope but also the water depth, flow velocity, wave length, wave obliquity, and wave period are important parameters for predicting the mean diameter of the armor units, highlighting the multivariate behavior of protecting the river bank in the presence of ship-induced waves and river flow velocity."}{"Impacts of rainfall and catchment characteristics on bioretention cell performance ": "Although many studies have evaluated the impacts of bioretention cell (BRC) design elements on hydrologic performance, few have investigated the roles played by site characteristics and rainfall patterns. The objectives of this study were to assess the impacts of rainfall and catchments with different characteristics on the hydrologic performance of BRCs and identify important factors in sizing bioretention when hydrologic performance was oriented for the design using a modeling approach. A 10-year record of rainfall data was used to identify the frequency and magnitude of rainfall events. The results showed that although the small and medium rainfall events were dominant they contributed less to the total rainfall depth than the large rainfall events. The ratio of runoff coefficient to imperviousness can be used as an indicator to explain why BRCs perform differently with the same design strategy under the same rainfall events. Rainfall patterns had significant impacts on the hydrologic performance of BRCs by influencing the overflow and underdrain flow. BRCs performed better for rainfall events with a longer duration and lower rainfall intensity because they generated smoother runoff processes into the BRCs. On the basis of these results, the runoff coefficient is suggested for BRC surface design."}{"Submerged flexible vegetation impact on open channel flow velocity distribution: An analytical modelling study on drag and friction ": "In this paper, an analytical model that represents the streamwise velocity distribution for open channel flow with submerged flexible vegetation is studied. In the present vegetated flow modelling, the whole flow field has been separated into two layers vertically: a vegetated layer and a non-vegetated free-water layer. Within the vegetated layer, an analysis of the mechanisms affecting water flow through flexible vegetation has been conducted. In the non-vegetated layer, a modified log-law equation that represents the velocity profile varying with vegetation height has been investigated.

Gabion structures offer one means of flood mitigation in dam spillways. These types of structures provide an additional challenge to the computational modeller in that flow through the porous gabions must be simulated. We have used a computational model to investigate the flow over gabion stepped spillways. The model was first validated against published experimental results. Then, gabion stepped spillways with four different step geometries were tested under the same conditions in order to facilitate inter-comparisons and to choose the best option in terms of energy dissipation. The results show that normal gabion steps can dissipate more energy than overlap, inclined, and pooled steps. An intensive set of tests with varying slope, stone size, and porosity were undertaken. The location of the inception point and the water depth at this point obtained from this study were compared with those from existing formulae. Two new empirical equations have been derived, on the basis of a regression analysis, to provide improved results for gabion stepped spillways."}{"Numerical simulation of flow separation over a backward-facing step with high Reynolds number ": "Large eddy simulation (LES) explicitly calculates the large-scale vortex field and parameterizes the small-scale vortices. In this study, LES and \u03ba-\u03b5 models were developed for a specific geometrical configuration of backward-facing step (BFS). The simulation results were validated with particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and direct numerical simulation (DNS). This LES simulation was carried out with a Reynolds number of 9000 in a pressurized water tunnel with an expansion ratio of 2.00. The results indicate that the LES model can reveal large-scale vortex motion although with a larger grid-cell size. However, the LES model tends to overestimate the top wall separation and the Reynolds stress components for the BFS flow simulation without a sufficiently fine grid. Overall, LES is a potential tool for simulating separated flow controlled by large-scale vortices."}{"Biosorption of Ni(II) ions from aqueous solution using modified Aloe barbadensis Miller leaf powder ": "This study aimed to investigate the biosorption potential of Na2CO3-modified Aloe barbadensis Miller (Aloe vera) leaf (MABL) powder for removal of Ni(II) ions from a synthetic aqueous solution. Effects of various process parameters (pH, equilibrium time, and temperature) were investigated in order to optimize the biosorptive removal. The maximum biosorption capacity of MABL was observed to be 28.986\u00a0mg/g at a temperature of 303\u00a0K, a biosorbent dose of 0.6\u00a0g, a contact time of 90\u00a0min, and a pH value of 7. Different kinetic models (the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models) were evaluated. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to be the best fitted model in this study, with a coefficient of determination of R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.974. Five different isotherm models (the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) models) were investigated to identify the best-suited isotherm model for the present system. Based on the minimum chi-square value (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a00.027) and the maximum coefficient of determination (R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.996), the Langmuir isotherm model was found to represent the system well, indicating the possibility of monolayer biosorption. The sticking probability (S*) was found to be 0.41, suggesting a physisorption mechanism for biosorption of Ni(II) on MABL. The biosorbent was characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential, and BET surface area, in order to understand its morphological and functional characteristics."}{"On-site stormwater detention for Australian development projects: Does it meet frequent flow management objectives? ": "On-site stormwater detention (OSD) is a conventional component of urban drainage systems, designed with the intention of mitigating the increase to peak discharge of stormwater runoff that inevitably results from urbanization. In Australia, singular temporal patterns for design storms have governed the inputs of hydrograph generation and in turn the design process of OSD for the last three decades. This paper raises the concern that many existing OSD systems designed using the singular temporal pattern for design storms may not be achieving their stated objectives when they are assessed against a variety of alternative temporal patterns. The performance of twenty real OSD systems was investigated using two methods: (1) ensembles of design temporal patterns prescribed in the latest version of Australian Rainfall and Runoff, and (2) real recorded rainfall data taken from pluviograph stations modeled with continuous simulation. It is shown conclusively that the use of singular temporal patterns is ineffective in providing assurance that an OSD will mitigate the increase to peak discharge for all possible storm events. Ensemble analysis is shown to provide improved results. However, it also falls short of providing any guarantee in the face of naturally occurring rainfall."}{"Flume experimental study on evolution of a mouth bar under interaction of floods and waves ": "Based on the characteristics of hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the bar area in the Modaomen Estuary, a flume experiment was performed to study the evolution of the longitudinal profile of the mouth bar. The mouth bar evolution was investigated under the impacts of floods with different return periods as well as flood-wave interaction. The results showed that floods with different return periods had significant influences on the evolution of the river mouth bar. Particularly on the inner slope of the mouth bar, the sediment was substantially active and moveable. The inner slope and the bar crest tended to be remarkably scoured. The erosion was intensified with the increase of the magnitude of floods. Moreover, the bar crest moved seawards, while the elevation of the bar crest barely changed. Under the flood-wave interaction, a remarkable amount of erosion on the inner and outer slopes of the mouth bar was also found. The seaward displacement of the bar crest under the interaction of floods and waves was less than it was under only the impact of floods, while more deposition was found on the crest of the mouth bar in this case."}{"Additive and additive-free treatment technologies for pulp and paper mill effluents: Advances, challenges and opportunities ": "In the present manuscript, novel effluent treatment processes for pulp and paper mill effluents are divided into two categories: a) those involving the use of chemical additives and b) those which are free of such chemicals. It is especially of high importance for pulp and paper industry to adopt the most efficient and cost-effective treatment methods. This paper critically reviews the recent studies on the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents while providing suggestions for further studies on the application of various physic-chemical and biological methods for the treatment of such complex effluents containing a number of recalcitrant pollutants."}{"Review of methods to assess sustainability of industrial water use ": "The projected increase of industrial water demands raises the need to assess the environmental sustainability of industrial water use. Assessment methods need to use Sustainable Systems Indicators (SSIs) which relate resource use to the carrying capacity of the local environment. SSIs for water use evaluate whether water use exceeds the natural water renewal (quantity) and whether emissions remain within the assimilation capacity of ecosystems (quality). We systematically reviewed the scientific literature to show which methods are used to assess industrial water use, and of these, which methods incorporate SSIs. In total, 82 assessment methods were identified in 340 papers. The methods were assigned to five categories: Key Performance Indicators, Composite Indices, Environmental Accounting, Material and Energy Flow Analysis, and Life Cycle Analysis. In 26% of the reviewed papers, the assessment methods used SSIs. The number of papers incorporating SSIs is growing at a slower rate than the overall number of papers in the area of sustainability assessments of industrial water use. Considering the expected growth in industrial water use this poses a risk to sustainable water use. The best performing category in terms of incorporating SSIs is Material and Energy Flow Analysis (42% of papers). Papers assessing several industrial sectors in the same study incorporate SSIs more frequently (68%) than research focused on a single industry or process (20%). We discuss examples from the reviewed papers which successfully incorporate SSIs, in order to: (1) identify the elements needed to create SSIs for industrial water use, (2) aid researchers and practitioners in selecting methods which incorporate SSIs, and (3) provide a starting point for future methodological development incorporating SSIs."}{"Wastewater characterization and treatment at a blueberry and carrot processing plant ": "Carrot and blueberry processing wastewaters were tested to determine total suspended solids (TSS) and organics (COD and BOD5) levels before and after wastewater treatment.

Blueberry wastewater was found to have TSS concentrations of 297\u202f\u00b1\u202f85 mgL\u22121, BOD5 concentrations of 1013\u202f\u00b1\u202f292 mgL\u22121, a maximum respiration rate of 10.3\u202fmg(L\u202fh)\u22121 and COD concentrations of 1947\u202f\u00b1\u202f388 mgL\u22121 before discharge. The final effluent of carrot processing wastewater had TSS concentrations of 3030\u202f\u00b1\u202f2975 mgL\u22121, BOD5 concentrations of 2780\u202f\u00b1\u202f1848 mgL\u22121, a maximum respiration rate of 65\u202fmg(L\u202fh)\u22121 and COD concentrations of 6363\u202f\u00b1\u202f2760 mgL\u22121. After acclimatization, extended respiration tests indicated a dramatic reduction in oxygen demand was possible in post-reel wastewater, with a 75% reduction in respiration rate over 150\u202fh for blueberry wastewater and an 85% reduction in respiration rate over only 20\u202fh for the more organically-rich carrot wastewater.\n                  Bench-scale treatments of preliminary settling, alum coagulation and sedimentation, and aeration were performed on the carrot processing wastewater. Preliminary settling and coagulation-sedimentation were highly effective for TSS removal, achieving 99% reduction in TSS as compared to raw wastewater, but were not effective for organics removal, however, aeration for eight hours with activated sludge achieved 73% removal of COD and 42% removal of BOD5, indicating that biological treatment was the most promising avenue for organics removal from carrot processing wastewater."}{"The water footprint of electricity in Ecuador: Technology and fuel variation indicate pathways towards water-efficient electricity mixes ": "Hydropower, biomass and thermal power plants (HPPs, BPPs and TPPs) consume water. The WF tool quantifies freshwater consumption. We calculated direct and indirect WFs of 255 Ecuadorian power plants using different technologies and fuels classified into eleven subclasses. Median WFs are largest for BPPs, followed by HPPs, while WFs of TPPs were smallest, but variation in subclasses is enormous. For HPPs, dammed HPPs have relatively large blue WFs, run-of-the-river HPPs have relatively small WFs, although they are significant to their electricity output. The cooling system is paramount for TPPs subclasses. Water-efficient cooling systems (once-through and dry-cooling) have 20% smaller WFs than wet-tower systems. Moreover, the fuel used affects the direct WF of TPPs significantly. Fuel and residue oil require water-intensive preheating; some diesel-fired TPPs use water as GHG control. BPPs are water-intensive because biomass has a large WF. Technology and fuel variation indicate pathways towards more water-efficient electricity mixes."}{"Analyzing the economic value of thermal power plant cooling water consumption ": "The consumption of water by thermal power plants for cooling purposes has presented several policy and resource allocation challenges in the recent past. There is need for improved economic understanding of thermal power plant water consumption to better address these challenges. In this paper, we examine the economic efficiency of water consumption substitutes for existing thermal power plants. In the long run, a power plant could reduce water consumption by investing in efficiency improvements. In the short run, a power plant could reduce water consumption by curtailing power output. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that these substitutes are not economically efficient; water prices in excess of $1.00/m3 would be required for power plants to make efficiency investments or curtail output. Thermal power plants are therefore not attractive targets for water consumption reduction initiatives based on pricing alone. Furthermore, in the long run, efficiency improvements only show significant water reduction potential for the most inefficient plants. However, the findings of the short run analysis indicate that since thermal power plants are willing to pay water prices in excess of $1.00/m3 before curtailing output, these power plants do not require free reallocation of water from senior water rights holders during periods of scarcity, as has been the practice in several regions. Instead, a more efficient water policy focus would be creation of enabling environments for water market transactions. Such water market transactions could help balance competing water demands during periods of scarcity, while maintaining reliable electricity supply."}{"A micro-scale cost-benefit analysis of building-level flood risk adaptation measures in Los Angeles ": "Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of flood risk adaptation strategies offers policymakers insight into economically optimal strategies for adapting to sea level rise. However, building-level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or building elevation are often evaluated at aggregated spatial scales, which may result in sub-optimal investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a flood risk model and combine it with a micro-scale CBA at the building level to obtain an optimal mix of adaptation measures per area. We apply this approach to Venice Beach in Los Angeles and Naples in Long Beach. We subsequently compare our results with the conventional, spatially aggregated area-based CBA approach. Our findings show that a mix of 35%\u201345% dry-floodproofing measures and 55%\u201365% building elevation measures is optimal. Elevation works best in areas with high inundation depths, while dry-floodproofing is preferable in areas with shallow inundation depths. The optimal mix of measures derived from our micro-scale approach results in an economic efficiency up to 85% higher than that yielded by the commonly applied spatially aggregated approach. We therefore recommend that economic evaluations of building-level adaptation measures are conducted at the smallest possible scale, or that CBAs are performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth."}{"WTP for water filters and water quality testing services in Guatemala ": "We conduct a contingent valuation study to estimate the willingness to pay for a point-of-use water quality technology and water quality testing services in the highlands of Guatemala. This study is unique in two ways: we measure drinking water quality at the household level through water samples collected at the household and we elicit the willingness to pay for water quality testing services. We find a significant divergence in subjects\u2019 perceptions of water quality and the measured bacteria counts in their household water. This divergence is economically important as perceptions may play a significant role in willingness to pay for water quality improvements."}{"Irrigation reservoirs as blue clubs: Governance and policy intervention ": ""}{"Economic evaluation of green water in cereal crop production: A production function approach ": "A great majority of agricultural water is provided by precipitation that is stored in soil moisture, defined as green water. This water evaporates or transpires through plants, and plays a determinative role in crop growth particularly for rainfed agriculture. This study aims to assess the economic value of green water production factor that has often been ignored in the literature, as the focus was mainly given on blue water resources. We employed the production function valuation method and specify a Cobb-Douglas production function, using cereal production in the Czech Republic as a case-study. Green water use was quantified through CROPWAT model, using year-to-year precipitation and evapotranspiration data at a national level for the period 1993-2014. The green water use values were incorporated into the production function, and the marginal value of green water was elicited by computing its marginal contribution with annual average crop market prices. Estimations were based on empirical time-series data at the national level. The marginal value of green water ranged from 17 to 25 USD/1000\u202fm3. To our best of knowledge this is the first study that reveals the value of green water and its contribution in the production value of cereals compared to other production factors. Our findings complement previous studies regarding the crop productivity of green water. We conclude with policy implications of the study findings, highlighting the use of green water value estimations in the compilation of water accounts, as emerged in the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Water."}{"Economic and food security effects of small-scale irrigation technologies in northern Ghana ": "Small-scale irrigation (SSI) technologies can be useful not only to increase crop productivity and income but also as a viable adaptation practice to climate variability. A farm simulation model (FARMSIM) and data from selected SSI technologies piloted in northern Ghana under the \u2018Feed the Future-Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation\u2019 (ILSSI) project were used to assess the economic feasibility of the SSI technologies and their potential to improve income and nutrition of smallholder farm households. Three dry season irrigated crops (onion, corchorus, amaranthus) grown under three agricultural water management regimes were analysed. Results show that adoption of the SSI technologies could increase the net farm profit by 154%\u2013608% against the baseline depending on the \u2018crop type - SSI technology\u2019 combination. Nutrition levels also improved significantly as a result of the improvements in crop yields due to irrigation and use of complementary inputs. However, the results further reveal that the options that utilize capital-intensive SSI technologies such as solar-powered water pumps to grow high value cash crops are constrained by the high investment cost. Currently, farmers tend to choose low-cost SSI technologies such as a traditional watering-cans, which generate low economic returns. Improving access to credit or alternative financing schemes could mitigate the capital constraints and enable smallholders to gain more benefits from participating in market-oriented high-value irrigated production."}{"Collective Local Payments for ecosystem services: New local PES between groups, sanctions, and prior watershed trust in Mexico ": "Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs are now high in number, if not always in impact. When groups of users pay groups of service providers, establishing PES involves collective action. We study the creation of collective PES institutions, and their continuation, as group coordination. We use framed lab-in-field experiments with hydroservices users and providers within watersheds participating in Mexico's Matching Funds program in Veracruz, Yucatan and Quintana Roo states. We explore the coordination of contributions between downstream users and upstream providers, plus effects of different types of sanctions that can affect expectations for both users and providers. Both information alone and sanctions raise contributions overall, although outcomes varied by site in line with our rankings of \u2018watershed trust\u2019. For instance, monetary sanctions raise contributions in the watershed we ranked high in trust, yet initially lowered them for the lowest-trust watershed. This suggests that upstream-downstream social capital will be central to new collective local PES, while our overall trends suggest social capital can be raised by successful coordination over time."}{"Pursuing water security in socio-hydrological systems ": ""}{"Water reallocation, benefit sharing, and compensation in northeastern Mexico: A retrospective assessment of El Cuchillo Dam ": "In 1994, former President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari inaugurated El Cuchillo reservoir to transfer up to 10\u202fm3/s from the Lower San Juan River to the city of Monterrey, a major Mexican metropolis. Since 1989, three agreements have been developed to finance, construct and operate the El Cuchillo project to benefit Monterrey and compensate the farmers in the downstream irrigation district. This study reviews the agreements and lessons from implementation experience after 25\u202fyears since the project\u2019s inauguration. The El Cuchillo demonstrates that water reallocation needs to be designed and assessed within a regional perspective to identify, measure and share the costs and benefits of reallocation between rural and urban regions. This case study shows the need to compensate the region not the individual."}{"Planning for sustained water-electricity resilience over the U.S.: Persistence of current water-electricity operations and long-term transformative plans ": "The electricity system relies upon the availability and predictability of water to support hydropower operations and cooling of thermoelectric plants, implying that water plays a fundamental role in power operations and that water-related stresses may have a critical effect on the electricity system. Designing for electricity system resilience to changing societal demands and environmental conditions is a complex and urgent endeavor, one that requires robust diagnosis and an articulation of interdependencies among key system components. Here we consider the argument that water may help to navigate that complexity, revealing thresholds for system change and the transformations that may be required for enduring resilience of the electricity sector. To assess this thesis, we apply a framework for understanding resilient systems following Folke et al. (2010), that is extended in this special issue (Boltz et al., 2019), by which resilience comprises three capabilities: system persistence, adaptability, and transformability. We apply this resilience diagnosis approach to the bulk electricity system of the contiguous United States, with particular attention to water-driven stressors. We provide a qualitative narrative that discusses the spectrum of resilience capabilities (persistence, adaptability, and transformability) of the water-electricity system in the United States over three scales of inter-dependencies: individual power plant, urban and grid scales."}{"An overview of biodiesel production using recyclable biomass and non-biomass derived magnetic catalysts ": "Biodiesel has emerged as a promising alternative to energy sources due to its eco-friendly and renewable nature. However, the issue associated with traditional biodiesel production is the expensive production cost on the industrial scale, mainly contributed by the raw materials. Therefore, catalyst plays an important role with the purpose to speed up the overall biodiesel production rate and minimizing the production cost. Over the course, numerous researches have been done on various types of catalyst in biodiesel production. Henceforth, this review comprises of a comprehensive overview of biodiesel production by discussing the latest trends, that utilizes biomass waste-derived biochar catalyst. Apart from that, the focus of this review will be on magnetic catalyst (derived from both biomass and non-biomass) used in biodiesel synthesis whereby the magnetic catalyst synthesis method and characterisation, as well as compilation of experimental data of different literatures on using magnetic catalyst will be included in the framework of this paper. Moreover, the magnetic catalyst reusability studies are also highlighted in this review. Application of biomass-based magnetic catalyst in biodiesel production may be one of the solutions to overcome the catalyst separation issue and to further the development of economically feasible biodiesel industry and ultimately, transforming the current energy options into a greener and more sustainable sources of energy."}{"Photocatalytic activity improvement and application of UV-TiO2 photocatalysis in textile wastewater treatment: A review ": "Treatment of textile wastewater using titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis has been started from the last decade and reached attention to the researchers because of its versatile application. The variety of applications of TiO2 as a photocatalyst has been taken place because of low operating temperature, biologically inert nature, low energy consumption, water insolubility, ease availability and photoactivity, less toxicity, high chemical stability, suitable flat band potential, narrow band gap and environmentally benign. The successful and efficient application of photocatalysis depends on quality of photocatalyst, nature of pollutants, and source of light, which should be in close contact with each other. The TiO2 photocatalyst is used for the effluent treatment of textile wastewater in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Heterogeneous UV-TiO2 photocatalysis is capable to remove organic pollutants from textile wastewater, which has been widely studied and the technology also being commercialized in many developing countries in the world. This review focuses on the mechanism of UV-TiO2 photocatalysis, modification of TiO2 photocatalyst, and application of doping and co-doping in order to improve the photocatalytic activity in wastewater treatment. In addition, the review conveys comprehensive and fundamental assessments of the photocatalytic activity for the removal of organic dyes and phenolic compounds from textile wastewater."}{"Photoelectrocatalytic fuel cells and photoelectrode microbial fuel cells for wastewater treatment and power generation ": "The use of solar energy for wastewater treatment combined with energy production by means of photoelectrocatalytic and photoelectrode microbial fuel cells has been reviewed, presenting the basic principles, the design and strengths and weaknesses of the devices. The most important parameters to evaluate the performance of this type of fuel cells are the pollutant degradation efficiency and the maximum power density generated. The effect of external and internal fuel cell parameters on the pollutant degradation efficiency and the maximum power density has been extensively discussed."}{"Potential and challenges of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in dye wastewater treatment: A review ": "Enzymes are known to catalyze reactions at high efficiency, operate at milder conditions and are biodegradable. Due to enzyme limitations such as sensitivity to environmental conditions, enzyme immobilization is often used. The commonly employed immobilization methods include adsorption, entrapment, covalent attachment and cross-linking. Many research works have now focused on the immobilization of enzymes on nanoscale support due to the higher surface area to volume ratio, effective enzyme loading, significantly enhanced mass transfer efficiency and minimization of diffusional problems. The application of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in the treatment of dye wastewater is thus, of high interest. Therefore, this paper has critically reviewed (1) the current technologies available for dye wastewater treatment; (2) different methods utilized for enzyme immobilization; and (3) the application and performance of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology for dye wastewater treatment. We identified that there is high potential for enzyme incorporated nanotechnology to be implemented in dye wastewater treatment due to the high decolorization performance (e.g. laccase immobilized on Fe3O4/SiO2 nanoparticles achieved 99% decolorization of Procion Red MX-5B in 20\u202fmin). We have also identified the key challenges faced by enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in dye wastewater treatment that includes: (i) realization of lab scale experiments to industrial applications; (ii) lack of understanding of enzymes incorporated nanotechnology; (iii) recovery of immobilized enzyme; (iv) synthesis of hybrid nanoflowers; and (v) sustainability of the nanomaterials used."}{"Degradation of amoxicillin by Fenton and Fenton-integrated hybrid oxidation processes ": "The present study aims to investigate the degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) using the Fenton process and hybrid Fenton-like processes such as photo-Fenton, solar photo-Fenton, sono-Fenton, and sono-photo-Fenton. The effect of ferrous ions (Fe2+), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and pH was evaluated. Complete degradation was achieved within 12\u2009min of reaction time under the optimized conditions of Fe2+- 30\u2009mg/l, H2O2 \u2013 375\u2009mg/l, and pH\u2009\u2013\u20093.0 during Fenton\u2019s process. Efficiency towards degradation of AMX was enhanced when the Fenton\u2019s process was coupled with UV- light illumination, solar light illumination, and UV light-Ultrasound treatment. Complete degradation was observed within 3.5\u2009min and 9\u2009min during the photo-Fenton and solar photo-Fenton process, respectively. The sono-Fenton process takes a longer time to degrade AMX than other processes while sono-photo-Fenton process degrades AMX within 6\u2009min. The reason for a reduced rate of degradation of AMX in the sono-Fenton process may be attributed to the competition of ultrasound and Fenton for H2O2, which ultimately decreases Fenton reagent in the process. The study concluded that the Fenton process coupled with other UV/solar light is more efficient than the stand-alone Fenton process towards degradation of AMX."}{"\n               Shorea robusta derived activated carbon decorated with manganese dioxide hybrid composite for improved capacitive behaviors ": "Shorea robusta derived activated carbon decorated with MnO2 was successfully prepared. Thus prepared activated carbon was characterized by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)/Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Results revealed that prepared material was found to be amorphous having oxygenated surface functional groups with the specific surface area 1270\u202fm2\u202fg\u22121 (\u00b10.57%). Electrochemical characterization was also performed by three-electrode system where carbon electrode was used as working electrode, platinum plate was used as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode was used as a reference electrode. The experiments were performed in 6\u202fM aqueous KOH using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge\u2013Discharge (GCD) and Impendance Spectroscopy (EIS). The specific capacitance acquired from GCD at 1\u202fAg\u22121 was found to be 136.3\u202fFg\u22121 (\u00b10.15%) with 0.44\u202f\u03a9 (\u00b10.02%) ESR. The 97% capacitance retention was observed after 1000 cycles. The energy density of carbon electrode was found to be 3.0 (\u00b10.25%)\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg\u22121 at 100.5 (\u00b10.20%)\u202fW\u202fkg\u22121 power density. The working carbon electrode was replaced by \u201chybrid composite electrode\u201d which showed the ideal capacitive behaviors having 480.4 (\u00b10.20%)\u202fF\u202fg\u22121 capacitance, 24 (\u00b10.26%)\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg\u22121 specific energy density and low ESR value of 0.41 (\u00b10.02%)\u202f\u03a9. The results showed that the desirable electrochemical capacitive performances enable the hybrid composite to act as a new bio material for high-performance supercapacitors and energy storage devices."}{"Electrochemical degradation of triclosan in aqueous solution. A study of the performance of an electro-Fenton reactor ": "The electro-Fenton degradation of Triclosan in aqueous solution was studied using a cylindrical reactor in which polarized carbon cloth electrodes and a cation exchange resin were employed. Using a factorial design of experiments approach, the effect of four variables (considering two levels for each one), was measured on four response parameters that reflect the electrooxidation efficiency of the electrochemical reactor. The results revealed that in all cases triclosan degradation was very efficient (above 95%) and that while there is a reasonable effect of all variables and their interactions, the one with the strongest influence on the process is the nature and magnitude of the ionic strength of the electrolytic solution. In this way, while the presence of a buffer species in this solution can keep the pH in a value that affects the generation of \u2022OH radicals from the Fenton mixture, a high ionic strength solution can promote the elimination of Fe ionic species from the reactor by decreasing resin Fe retention due to competition effects of other ions for the binding sites of the substrate. HPLC experiments of the effluent solutions, also revealed that the degradation by-products of triclosan were dependent on the nature and ionic strength of the electrolytic solution in the electro-Fenton process under study. Finally, comparison of the different operation modes, also suggested that electro-adsorption of Fe cationic species in the negatively polarized cathode surface, is the main factor that controls Fe ion retention within the reactor."}{"Flocculation: An effective way to harvest microalgae for biodiesel production ": "Microalgae are considered the most suitable feedstock for biodiesel production due to their higher areal productivity and lipid content. The economical production of biofuels from microalgae is important. This paper is a review of different techniques used for flocculating microalgae such as use of inorganic salts, organic salts, bioflocculants, autoflocculation and electrolytic flocculation for harvesting microalgae for biodiesel production. It was found that the usage of natural flocculants for harvesting microalgae eliminates the toxicity of biomass harvested but the cost of flocculant makes it uneconomical for large scale applications. The economic method of harvesting large quantity of microalgae still requires further research and development."}{"Assimilation of remote sensing into crop growth models: Current status and perspectives ": "Timely monitoring of crop lands is important in order to make agricultural activities more sustainable, as well as ensuring food security. The use of Earth Observation (EO) data allows crop monitoring at a range of spatial scales, but can be hampered by limitations in the data. Crop growth modelling, on the other hand, can be used to simulate the physiological processes that result in crop development. Data assimilation (DA) provides a way of blending the monitoring properties of EO data with the predictive and explanatory abilities of crop growth models. In this paper, we first provide a critique of both the advantages and disadvantages of both EO data and crop growth models. We use this to introduce a solid and robust framework for DA, where different DA methods are shown to be derived from taking different assumptions in solving for the a posteriori probability density function (pdf) using Bayes\u2019 rule. This treatment allows us to provide some recommendation on the choice of DA method for particular applications. We comment on current computational challenges in scaling DA applications to large spatial scales. Future areas of research are sketched, with an emphasis on DA as an enabler for blending different observations, as well as facilitating different approaches to crop growth models. We have illustrated this review with a large number of examples from the literature."}{"Integrating satellite and climate data to predict wheat yield in Australia using machine learning approaches ": "Wheat is the most important staple crop grown in Australia, and Australia is one of the top wheat exporting countries globally. Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine-learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD) level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark) and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network) to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R2 \u02dc 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction."}{"Light interception in experimental forests affected by tree diversity and structural complexity of dominant canopy ": "Biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning in forests by, for example, enhancing growth and altering the forest structure towards greater complexity with cascading effects on other processes and trophic levels. Complexity in forest canopy could enhance light interception and form a link between diversity and productivity in polyculture forests, but the effect of canopy structure on light interception is rarely directly measured.\n                  We modelled the canopy surface structure of a tree diversity experiment by photographing it using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and combining the photos into a digital elevation model with photogrammetry tools. We analysed the effects of tree diversity and functional diversity on canopy structural complexity and light interception with a structural equation model.\n                  Our results show that: a) increased structural complexity of the canopy reduces light interception, whereas b) tree diversity increases the structural complexity of the canopy, and has a dual impact on light interception. Tree diversity decreased light interception through the structural complexity of the canopy but increased it probably through canopy packing and crown complementarity. However, the effects of both tree diversity and structural complexity of canopy were smaller than the effect of the functional identities of the tree species, especially the differences between deciduous and evergreen trees.\n                  We conclude that more complexity in canopy structure can be gained through increased tree diversity, but complex canopy structure does not increase light interception in young forests."}{"Three dimensional mapping of forest canopy equivalent water thickness using dual-wavelength terrestrial laser scanning ": "Globally, forests are being subjected to numerous threats, including climate change, wildfires, and insect and disease outbreaks, among others. Satellite optical remote sensing data have been widely utilized in early detection of tree and forest stress by estimating water status metrics such as the leaf Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). This estimate, however, is affected by soil characteristics and understory vegetation and often ignores the effects of the fine-scale heterogeneity of canopy structure and leaf water content. Such effects can be better understood by studying the EWT distribution in three dimensions. In this study, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) intensity data from the commercially-available Leica P20 and P40 instruments (808\u202fnm and 1550\u202fnm respectively) were combined in a Normalized Difference Index (NDI). NDI was used to map EWT of 12 trees in three dimensions from floor to canopy in a mixed broadleaf forest plot (Wytham Woods, UK). The average error in EWT estimates across three species was less than 8%. The three dimensional point clouds revealed that, in this snapshot, EWT changes vertically, usually increasing towards canopy top. The proposed method has the potential to provide predawn EWT measurements, is independent of solar illumination, and can lead to a better understanding of the factors affecting satellite estimation of EWT."}{"Flux Puppy \u2013 An open-source software application and portable system design for low-cost manual measurements of CO2 and H2O fluxes ": "Manual chamber-based measurements of CO2 (and H2O) fluxes are important for understanding ecosystem carbon metabolism. Small opaque chambers can be used to measure leaf, stem and soil respiration. Larger transparent chambers can be used to measure net ecosystem exchange of CO2, and small jars often serve this purpose for laboratory incubations of soil and plant material. We developed an Android application (app), called Flux Puppy, to facilitate chamber-based flux measurements in the field and laboratory. The app is designed to run on an inexpensive handheld Android device, such as a tablet or phone, and it has a graphical user interface that communicates with a LI-COR LI-820 and LI-830 (CO2) or LI-840 and LI-850 (CO2/H2O) infrared gas analyzer. The app logs concentrations of CO2 and H2O, cell temperature and pressure at 1\u2009Hz, displays the output graphically, and calculates the linear regression slope, R-squared, and standard error of the CO2 time series. A metadata screen allows users to enter operator, site, and plot information, as well as take a photograph using the Android device\u2019s built-in camera, and log measurement location using the device GPS. Additionally, there is a notes field, which can be revised after the measurements are taken. Data files (the 1\u2009s raw data, photograph, and metadata including statistics calculated from the raw data) are then transmitted off the device through file sharing options (Gmail, Outlook, Google Drive, Dropbox etc.). Because Flux Puppy code is open-source (available on GitHub) and the flux measurement system we describe is relatively inexpensive and straightforward to assemble, it should be of broad interest to the carbon cycling community."}{"A new spatial modeling and interpolation approach for high-resolution temperature maps combining reanalysis data and ground measurements ": "Despite of their increasing importance as inputs to models for a wide range of scientific fields, high-resolution meteorological variables are not recorded very often on spatially regular grids. This problem is usually overcome by using data from reanalysis models, although they are less accurate. This paper discusses the development of a new spatial downscaling methodology to provide high-resolution maps of daily maximum and minimum air temperature. The application of this approach provides thorough observations in sparsely sampled areas by combining the accuracy of measurements from ground-based stations with the high availability and uniformity of model-based data. The dataset includes more than a decade (2003\u20132013) of data collected at 113 stations, about 30% of which constituted an independent set for the validation procedure. The efficacy of this approach is evaluated using statistical scores that are regularly employed in model evaluation studies and the improvements over the classical approach are remarkable. The results show that overall the our \"hybrid\" method provides fair estimates of temperature values. Particularly, MBE is less than 0.29\u202f\u00b0C and 0.60\u202f\u00b0C for the daily maximum and minimum air temperature respectively; RMSE is less than 1.24\u202f\u00b0C for the maximum temperature and 1.86\u202f\u00b0C for the minimum temperature, the analysis on MAE assures that there is not contribution of the errors in the spatial variability (MAE \u2248 RMSE). The correlation coefficient, close to 1 (\u03c1 \u2248 0.97), indicates a strong positive linear relationship."}{"Mapping daily evapotranspiration over a large irrigation district from MODIS data using a novel hybrid dual-source coupling model ": "Accurate knowledge of spatially distributed evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for better understanding the availability and utilization of water resources. Over the past several decades, remote sensing (RS) technique has been widely applied to acquire indispensable input data for the estimation of ET at different spatial and temporal scales. Several dual-source ET models that can partition evaporation and transpiration have been developed by utilizing remote sensing data and ancillary meteorological observations. However, due to the significant spatial variability of air temperature over heterogeneous land surface, these models typically cannot be applied in heterogeneous regions with scarce meteorological observations. In the present study, a new model, referred to as the HTEM-ABL model, is developed by coupling the Hybrid dual-source scheme and Trapezoid framework-based ET Model (HTEM) with a simple atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model for ET estimation without ancillary air temperature observations. This model uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as the main input and is evaluated with field observations over a large irrigation district in North China. Results show that the HTEM-ABL model can be well applied to the study area, and the accuracy of HTEM-ABL model is slightly superior to the original HTEM model. The root mean square errors between the calculated and measured ET are 0.63 mm/day and 29.6 mm/year at the field scale and the regional scale, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated air temperature has been proved to be accurate qualitatively and quantitatively, and provides another aspect to evaluate the HTEM-ABL model. The spatial and temporal distributions of ET produced by the HTEM-ABL model are in good agreement with both the distribution of land use types and the variations of crop growth stages. In addition, the HTEM-ABL model shows less sensitivity to land surface temperature compared with the original HTEM model."}{"Energy partitioning and evapotranspiration over a rotated paddy field in Southern China ": "There have been recent significant changes in crop rotation and irrigation methods in paddy fields in southern China. Examining the dynamics of energy exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) in rotated paddy fields is important for better understanding of land surface processes affected by human activities. In the present study, energy fluxes, including net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H) and soil heat flux (G) were investigated using two years (2016\u20132017) eddy covariance measurements from a rotated paddy field in southern China. The results showed that LE was the main consumer of Rn. Seasonal LE/Rn varied from 0.77 to 0.86 for the rice seasons, and from 0.48 to 0.51 for the milk vetch and fallow seasons. H showed an opposite seasonal trend with LE. G was higher during the milk vetch and fallow seasons because of the greater coverage of exposed soil. The high Priestley-Taylor coefficient (\u03b1, 1.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16) and decoupling factor (\u03a9, 0.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15) corroborated the energy-limited conditions for the rotated paddy field, indicating that Rn was the main meteorological factor governing ET. Canopy conductance (Gc) was closely related to \u03b1, suggesting that daily ET was significantly affected by Gc. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and leaf area index (LAI) played secondary roles in daily ET through their effects on Gc. ET was also affected by the wet and dry conditions of the paddy field. ET was slightly enhanced under dry conditions when LAI was low, while it decreased when LAI was large."}{"Simulation of maize evapotranspiration: An inter-comparison among 29 maize models ": "Crop yield can be affected by crop water use and vice versa, so when trying to simulate one or the other, it can be important that both are simulated well. In a prior inter-comparison among maize growth models, evapotranspiration (ET) predictions varied widely, but no observations of actual ET were available for comparison. Therefore, this follow-up study was initiated under the umbrella of AgMIP (Agricultural Model Inter-Comparison and Improvement Project). Observations of daily ET using the eddy covariance technique from an 8-year-long (2006\u20132013) experiment conducted at Ames, IA were used as the standard for comparison among models. Simulation results from 29 models are reported herein. In the first \u201cblind\u201d phase for which only weather, soils, phenology, and management information were provided to the modelers, estimates of seasonal ET varied from about 200 to about 700\u2009mm. Subsequent three phases provided (1) leaf area indices for all years, (2) all daily ET and agronomic data for a typical year (2011), and (3) all data for all years, thus allowing the modelers to progressively calibrate their models as more information was provided, but the range among ET estimates still varied by a factor of two or more. Much of the variability among the models was due to differing estimates of potential evapotranspiration, which suggests an avenue for substantial model improvement. Nevertheless, the ensemble median values were generally close to the observations, and the medians were best (had the lowest mean squared deviations from observations, MSD) for several ET categories for inter-comparison, but not all. Further, the medians were best when considering both ET and agronomic parameters together. The best six models with the lowest MSDs were identified for several ET and agronomic categories, and they proved to vary widely in complexity in spite of having similar prediction accuracies. At the same time, other models with apparently similar approaches were not as accurate. The models that are widely used tended to perform better, leading us speculate that a larger number of users testing these models over a wider range of conditions likely has led to improvement. User experience and skill at calibration and dealing with missing input data likely were also a factor in determining the accuracy of model predictions. In several cases different versions of a model within the same family of models were run, and these within-family inter-comparisons identified particular approaches that were better while other factors were held constant. Thus, improvement is needed in many of the models with regard to their ability to simulate ET over a wide range of conditions, and several aspects for progress have been identified, especially in their simulation of potential ET."}{"Decontamination of caesium and strontium from stainless steel surfaces using hydrogels ": "Current methods for the decontamination of radioactively contaminated surfaces in nuclear facilities typically rely on the use of liquid agents to remove radionuclides. This generates large volumes of highly hazardous liquid waste which must then be treated in costly processes which often require purpose built plant. For the first time we report a nitric acid loaded polymer hydrogel based approach which gives a high decontamination factor for the removal of 137Cs and 90Sr on 304\u202fL grade stainless steel surfaces. The generation of minimal liquid waste and no lateral spread or increased penetration of radionuclides helps mitigate many of the intrinsic hazards of liquid based decontamination methods. Once dried these gels are able to retain the contaminants for treatment as solid waste resulting in a concentrated, less mobile waste form presenting significantly reduced hazards and treatment constraints."}{"Design and development of self-healing coating based on thiol\u2013epoxy reactions ": "Cracks caused by the effects of mechanical or chemicals forces on coatings may cause their performance to deteriorate and may shorten their lifetime. The microcapsules used for self-healing coatings provide automatic recovery and extend the life of the coatings. In this study, polyurea-formaldehyde epoxy resin (PUF-epoxy) microcapsules were synthesized by in-situ polymerization; because, they allow the size control of the microcapsules, the thickness of the shell can be controlled, its production is easy, it is cheap and combinable with industry. Synthesized microcapsules were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), optical microscope, UV spectrum, zeta analyzer and contact angle measurements. As a result of the thermal analysis, the core (epoxy) content of the microcapsules was 57% by weight and 60% by the extraction method based on the principle of selective dissolution, and these two values were compatible with each other. The average microcapsule diameter was found as 185\u202fnm. For the first time in the literature, an epoxy-containing microcapsule was added to the thiol-containing coating material and a self-healing coating was prepared. The epoxy-containing microcapsules were artificially cracked and the epoxy resin released from it reacted with the thiol received in the coating. For this reason, it was observed that the artificial scratches formed on the coatings showed good self-healing properties."}{"Effect of backbone structure on the thermoelectric performance of indacenodithiophene-based conjugated polymers ": "Two indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based conjugated polymers, PIDT-EDOT and PIDTT-EDOT, were designed and synthesized as organic thermoelectric materials. Compared to PIDT-EDOT, the IDT unit of PIDTT-EDOT was extended by incorporating two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units into the polymer main chain. The polymer PIDTT-EDOT showed better thermal stability and more planar conjugated structure than PIDT-EDOT. Meanwhile, different thermoelectric properties were observed when the two polymer films were doped with FeCl3. PIDTT-EDOT showed better thermoelectric properties than PIDT-EDOT, and the highest power factor observed for PIDTT-EDOT was 0.867\u202f\u03bcW\u202fm\u22121\u202fK\u22122 at 453\u202fK, which is approximately 25 times higher than that of PIDT-EDOT. These results indicate that a slight change in the polymer main chain will have a great impact on the thermoelectric properties of IDT-based conjugated polymers. The data presented herein can be used as a reference for the design of new high-performance thermoelectric materials."}{"Dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose cross-linked chitosan for the recovery of palladium and platinum from aqueous solution ": "Platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) have widespread applications, such as in catalysts, jewelry, fuel cells, and electronics because of their favorable physical and chemical properties. Recovery of Pt and Pd from secondary sources is of great concern due to the increased market demand and limitation of the natural reserves of these precious metals. The aim of this research is to achieve recovery of Pt and Pd ions from dilute aqueous solution using dialdehyde of carboxymethyl cellulose (DCMC) crosslinked chitosan (Ch-DCMC). The DCMC was prepared by periodate oxidation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Both the DCMC and Ch-DCMC were characterized before and after Pt or Pd adsorption using Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of cross-linking ratios of chitosan and DCMC (1:1, 1:0.8, 1:0.5, 1:0.25 and 1:0.1) on the Pt and Pd recovery was studied. The optimal cross-linking ratio was found to be 1:0.25 (chitosan: DCMC) with maximum adsorption capacity of 80.8\u202fmg/g Pt and 89.4\u202fmg/g Pd. High selectivity for Pt and Pd compared to base metals and common anions was achieved."}{"Low cost fabrication of polypropylene fiber composite membrane with excellent mechanical, superhydrophilic, antifouling and antibacterical properties for effective oil-in-water emulsion separation ": "In this work, a low cost and flexible composite membrane containing the meltblown and spunbond polypropylene (PP) microfibers was designed and fabricated by means of the hot pressing followed by dip-coating of chitosan solution. We systematically studied the morphological structure, wettability, mechanical property, anti-oil fouling and anti-bacterial performance. The chitosan-modified PP (CS-PP) composite membrane exhibited the superhydrophilicity, underwater superoleophobicity and ultralow oil-adhesion property. Meanwhile, it was found that, solely under the driving of gravity, the water permeation flux of the CS-PP composite membrane was 325, 315, 276 and 265\u202fL\u00b7m\u00b7\u22122\u00b7h\u22121 for the toluene-in-water, n-hexane-in-water, diesel-in-water and vegetable oil-in-water emulsions, respectively, and the separation efficiency was up to 99%. The antibacterial activity could be observed for the CS-PP composite membrane by the inhibition zone testing. In addition, the combination of meltblown and spunbond PP microfiber endowed the composite membrane with excellent tensile strength (up to 6.78\u202fMPa). All these results suggest the CS-PP composite membrane as a promising potential and energy-efficient separation membrane for the treatment of surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsion."}{"Crosslinked chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol)-based polyelectrolytes for proton exchange membranes ": "The preparation of polyelectrolytes based on crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and chitosan (CS) was considered as a feasible alternative to develop highly functionalised, cost-effective and eco-friendly membranes for proton exchange fuel cell technologies. CS/PVA-based membranes were combined with sulfosuccinic acid (SSA) as crosslinking and sulfonating agent, and glycerol (GL) to promote flexibility and favour their manageability. The chemical structure, the thermo-oxidative behaviour, the ethanol uptake, the electric, the proton conductivity, and the performance in direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) were assessed. In general, all the CS/PVA-based polyelectrolytes showed a synergetic increase of thermo-oxidative stability, appropriate absorption and diffusion of ethanol and good proton conductivity, suitable for the typical service conditions of fuel cells. The GL in the membranes reacted with SSA, reduced the ethanol absorption, the diffusion coefficient and the proton conductivity, but acted as a plasticiser that increased the ductile manageability of the polyelectrolytes to be mounted on the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA). Higher presence of CS and higher proportion of GL in the polyelectrolyte, improved the material performance in the DEFC. In particular, the crosslinked polyelectrolyte 40CS/PVA/SSA/20GLwith a 40%wt. of CS referred to PVA, and a 20%wt. of GL referred to CS, showed a suitable behaviour in the DEFC test, with a maximum value of power density of 746\u202fmW\u00b7cm\u22122."}{"Using grafted poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) for the compatibilization of thermoplastic starch-polylactic acid blends ": "Thermoplastic starch (S) and polylactic acid (PLA) blend films were obtained by melt blending and compression moulding using grafted polycaprolactone with maleic anhydride and/or glycidyl methacrylate (PCLMG or PCLG) as compatibilizers. The effect of both the PLA ratio in the blend (20 and 40% with respect to starch) and the amount of both compatibilizers (2.5 and 5%) on the film properties was analysed. Compatibilized blends presented a better dispersion of the PLA in the continuous starch phase, but the use of PCLG provoked a phase inversion in the matrix when 40% of the starch was substituted by PLA. The compatibilized blend films exhibited higher values of elastic modulus than pure starch films, but were less extensible. The use of compatibilizers did not affect the film's water vapour permeability, which was reduced by up to 33 or 50% for 20 and 40% PLA, respectively, although inverted films with 40% PLA and 5% PCLG, exhibited marked reduction (67%). Compatibilizers decreased the oxygen permeability of the films by about 50%, regardless of the ratio of PLA and the kind and amount of compatibilizer. Therefore, substituting 20% of the starch by PLA and incorporating 5% of PCLG would be a good strategy to obtain films useful for food packaging."}{"Blends of tri-block copolymers and addition curing resins: Influence of block copolymer-resin compatibility on toughness and matrix properties on toughenability ": "In any sort of rubber toughening of thermosets, there are two principal influences on toughness: Morphology of the elastomer particulate phase and toughenability of the matrix resin. These two factors are difficult to separate experimentally. A new approach is presented which is based on large numbers of data. By analysing property-property-relationships an attempt is made to identify generalizable rules. A tri-block copolymer (PCL-PDMSi-PCL) is analysed in detail: By varying the molecular weights of the compatible and incompatible blocks in two different epoxy resins the influence of morphology on toughness is studied. Linear (Tg and rubbery plateau modulus) and non-linear (yield stress and post-yield behaviour) matrix properties are examined for a larger number of resin/curing agent combinations toughened with three different toughening agents in order to elucidate which matrix property controls toughenability. The same resin/curing agent array was used to study the influence of matrix polarity on morphology and properties for one PCL-PDMSi-PCL tri-block-copolymer."}{"Accelerating the rates of catalytic reaction through dynamic surface resonance manipulation ": ""}{"PGM fuel cell catalyst activities improved through computationally-assisted design ": ""}{"Tamm Review: Re-imagining forestry and wood business: pathways to rural development, poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation in the tropics ": "Millions of people are dependent on tropical forests for livelihood. However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships.\n                  Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments.\n                  To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to re-imagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation."}{"Finding the sweet spot: Shifting optimal climate for maple syrup production in North America ": "Climate change is affecting the benefits society derives from forests. One such forest ecosystem service is maple syrup, which is primarily derived from Acer saccharum (sugar maple), currently an abundant and widespread tree species in eastern North America. Two climate sensitive components of sap affect syrup production: sugar content and sap flow. The sugar in maple sap derives from carbohydrate stores influenced by prior year growing season conditions. Sap flow is tied to freeze/thaw cycles during early spring. Predicting climate effects on syrup production thus requires integrating observations across scales and biological processes. We observed sap at 6 sugar maple stands spanning sugar maple\u2019s latitudinal range over 2\u20136\u202fyears to predict the role of climate variation on sugar content and sap flow. We found that the timing of sap collection advanced by 4.3\u202fdays for every 1\u202f\u00b0C increase in March mean temperature, sap volume peaked at a January-May mean temperature of 1\u202f\u00b0C, and sap sugar content declined by 0.1 \u00b0Brix for every 1\u202f\u00b0C increase in previous May-October mean temperature. Using these empirical relationships, we projected that the sap collection season midpoint will be 1\u202fmonth earlier and sap sugar content will decline by 0.7 \u00b0Brix across sugar maple\u2019s range by the year 2100 in an RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. The region of maximum sap flow is expected to shift northward by 400\u202fkm, from near the 43rd parallel to the 48th parallel by 2100. Our findings suggest climate change will have profound effects on syrup yield across most of sugar maple\u2019s range; drastic shifts in the timing of the tapping season accompanied by flat to moderate increases in syrup yield per tap in Canada contrast with declines in syrup yield and higher frequencies of poor syrup production years across most of the U.S. range."}{"Linking forest growth with stand structure: Tree size inequality, tree growth or resource partitioning and the asymmetry of competition ": "Stand structure can strongly influence forest growth and other processes, such as the water balance, carbon partitioning, nutrient cycling and light dynamics. However, individual structural variables can be positively or negatively correlated with growth. This is the case for variables such as size inequality and those that describe resource partitioning, such as the degree of symmetric/asymmetric competition and growth dominance. Several contrasting growth-structure correlations are reviewed and linked to forest processes by considering the different types of tree interactions they are associated with. Contrasting growth-structure correlations appear to converge when they are examined using a simple framework where stand growth is a function of three variables as opposed to any one of the variables alone; stand density, size distributions and tree size-growth relationships. The size distributions quantify how the stand density is distributed between the different sizes while the size-growth relationships quantify how growth is partitioned between different sizes. Size inequality may not often be a useful explanatory variable and instead it appears to sometimes correlate with growth because it can be correlated with other variables that influence growth. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the effects of structure on growth have received little attention and a long-term growth and yield data set from central Europe was used to examine how the effects of structure can change along climatic gradients. The simple framework of three variables could be used to separate the effects of structure and functioning when comparing mixed and monospecific forests, as well as to design silvicultural interventions or to determine whether past management interventions have achieved their goals. The implications for selecting which structural variables to use and when scaling up to the stand level, are also discussed."}{"Reduced-impact logging for climate change mitigation (RIL-C) can halve selective logging emissions from tropical forests ": "Selective logging causes at least half of the emissions from tropical forest degradation. Reduced-impact logging for climate (RIL-C) is proposed as a way to maintain timber production while minimizing forest damage. Here we synthesize data from 61 coordinated field-based surveys of logging impacts in seven countries across the tropics. We estimate that tropical selective logging emitted 834 Tg CO2 in 2015, 6% of total tropical greenhouse gas emissions. Felling, hauling, and skidding caused 59%, 31%, and 10% of these emissions, respectively. We suggest that RIL-C incentive programs consider a feasible target carbon impact factor of 2.3\u202fMg emitted per Mg of timber extracted. Operational modifications are needed to achieve this target, such as reduced wood waste, narrower haul roads, and lower impact skidding equipment. Full implementation would reduce logging emissions by 44% (366 Tg CO2 year\u22121) and deliver 4% of the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Climate Agreement from tropical countries, while maintaining timber supplies."}{"Effects of understory fire management treatments on California Hazelnut, an ecocultural resource of the Karuk and Yurok Indians in the Pacific Northwest ": "Before widespread fire exclusion policies, American Indians used broadcast understory fires or cultural burns to enhance resources integral for their livelihood and cultural practices. To restore ecocultural resources depleted from decades of fire exclusion and to reduce wildfire risks, the Karuk and the Yurok Tribes of Northwest California are leading regional collaborative efforts to expand broadcast fires and fuel reduction treatments on public, private, and Tribal lands in their ancestral territories. Through collaboration with Karuk and Yurok Tribal members and basketweavers, we evaluated the effects of broadcast fires and three fire proxy treatments on California hazelnut shrubs (Corylus cornuta var. californica) that produce highly valued ecocultural resources for basketry materials. Across a 10\u202fha Douglas-fir and mixed hardwood forest (500\u202fm a.s.l.) in the Klamath mountains, we established 27 stratified blocks (16\u202fm2) and within each block applied three fire proxy treatments designed and used by Tribal members with an untreated control. These treatments involved manual hazelnut stem cutting, directly blistering hazelnut stems via propane torch, and igniting surface fuels piled within hazelnut shrubs to top-kill stems. Broadcast fire was applied to 12 separate blocks. After a full growing season (12\u201318\u202fmonths post-treatment/burn), shrubs were re-measured. We then harvested these stems (n\u202f=\u202f604; 50 shrubs) across treatments and compared results with stems gathered independently by two experienced Karuk/Yurok basketweavers (n\u202f=\u202f396 and n\u202f=\u202f73) from an adjacent broadcast burned site. Compared to the untreated shrubs, pile burning, propane torching, and broadcast burning increased basketry stem production by 7\u201310 fold (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), while the cutting treatment increased production by 4-fold (p\u202f=\u202f0.006). Shrubs with relatively greater access to sunlight (southern aspect, \u226551% and <70% canopy cover) produced fewer quality stems when compared to shrubs with an eastern aspect (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and \u226570% canopy cover (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Harvested stems across all treatments displayed similar stem length distributions to those gathered by one of the two basketweavers (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Our results demonstrate that these fire-proxy methods are an effective means to increase the production and quality of basketry materials. Expanding the area and frequency of targeted understory fire-based forest treatments on private, public and Tribal lands in California and the Pacific Northwest would substantially increase the availability of these fire-enhanced ecocultural resources that are currently limited in supply and in high demand."}{"Utilizing a topographic moisture index to characterize understory vegetation patterns in the boreal forest ": "For the purpose of informing biodiversity conservation efforts in managed landscapes, we explored whether and how understory plant communities (abundance, diversity, composition) were related to a topographic moisture index, called depth-to-water, in the boreal mixedwood forests of northwestern Alberta. Depth-to-water is an index of relative site moisture derived from the Wet Areas Mapping tool using a fine-scale digital elevation model based upon remotely-sensed lidar (light detection and ranging) data. Sample plots were placed along the depth-to-water moisture gradient in three forest types: conifer-dominated, mixedwood, and broadleaf -(deciduous) dominated. Understory vascular plant diversity, abundance, and composition were measured for each plot. We found understory attributes were related to the depth-to-water index with the relationships varying among forest types. In coniferous stands, diversity and abundance (cover) were higher on drier sites. In broadleaf and mixedwood stands, understory abundance was higher on drier sites, but diversity was not related to the depth-to-water index. Lastly, composition was significantly, but weakly, related to the depth-to-water index in all three forest types. Our study shows that this moisture index, based on remotely-sensed data, can be used to characterize patterns in understory vascular plant communities; hence it can be useful for identifying areas of particular interest for conservation or management."}{"Tamm Review: Direct seeding to restore oak (Quercus spp.) forests and woodlands ": "The scale of opportunity to implement forest restoration exceeds billions of ha worldwide, and a part of this area in northern temperate regions includes formerly oak (Quercus spp.)-dominated ecosystems. The cost of achieving restoration is often high, and tends to increase with severity of ecosystem degradation. Therefore, it is important to develop cost-efficient regeneration practices to support forest restoration. Direct seeding of acorns, one of the earliest artificial forest regeneration techniques developed, offers several benefits including costs that can be about a third of planting oak seedlings. However, direct seeding is presently a more uncertain practice for establishing oak forests and woodlands than is planting seedlings. Much of this uncertainty can be a result of acorn depredation by rodents even though other factors may also limit oak establishment. This review provides a synthesis of foundational knowledge, particularly from Europe and North America, pertaining to the biology and ecology of acorn production, acorn germination, early seedling growth, and acorn depredation by granivorous rodents. We build on this knowledge to review research on operational direct seeding practices and four basic strategies for acorn depredation control (chemical, ecological, physical and silvicultural). We suggest that environmentally sound approaches to minimize acorn depredation and increase seedling establishment currently exists. For example, seeding operations probably hold higher chances for success if scheduled during years of high masting, if applied on open sites (areas with little shrub and tree cover), and if acorn lots are sized and sown at an appropriate depth. Several gaps in our knowledge limit the development of improved operational practices for broader success. We lack information on basic acorn biology and proper handling and storage practices for many of the oaks around the world. And, we need research to support development of new techniques or combinations of strategies and techniques that minimize acorn depredation under a wide range of site conditions. Nevertheless, our synthesis suggests that direct seeding will remain a cost-effective and environmentally sound practice for oak forest and woodland establishment, and it will likely gain expanded use as future research informs innovation that increases seed availability, decreases acorn depredation, and raises predictability of oak seedling establishment."}{"Structure and dynamics of forests dominated by Sequoiadendron giganteum\n             ": "The largest tree species, Sequoiadendron giganteum has a small native range restricted to California\u2019s Sierra Nevada. Awe-inspiring stature contributed to its protection from logging, but anthropogenic climate change\u2014particularly hotter drought\u2014and over a century of fire suppression are possible threats. We measured 60 trees in seven forests to improve allometric equations for the species and installed five 1-ha plots to quantify biomass of Sequoiadendron and associated vegetation. Plots were re-measured after 5\u202fyr to compute biomass increments and examine effects of management history as well as impacts of recent drought. Forests held up to 2683\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121 aboveground biomass (1373\u202fMg\u202fC\u202fha\u22121) and had leaf area index (LAI) up to 14.5 with Sequoiadendron accounting for the bulk of biomass but not LAI. Live trees of other species contributed up to 10.6 LAI and had biomass increments up to 6.1\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121\u202fyr\u22121, but drought contributed to tree mortality in three plots, where live biomass declined by 6.2\u201310.3\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121\u202fyr\u22121. Two plots had very little tree mortality and gained 5.5\u20137.9\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121\u202fyr\u22121. Sequoiadendron productivity was strongly correlated with tree-level photosynthetic capacity, but at the height of the drought, relative growth\u2014expressed as the ratio of biomass produced during the driest and wettest recent years\u2014correlated positively with site productivity and negatively with both vertical distance to water and presumed competition from neighboring trees. Prescribed fire in one plot caused a growth release in trees whose lower trunks were burnt and small neighboring Abies lowiana were killed. Effects of 21st century drought on Sequoiadendron productivity were greater in northern than southern locations but of lesser magnitude than many past events. No Sequoiadendron recruitment was observed.

Our analysis compares the environmental range of C. lukuohia and its spread over time through the known climatic range and distribution of \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a. Analyses show this fungal pathogen generally encompassed the core, but not the extremes of the climatic range of \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a. We further modeled the potential distribution of C. lukuohia across the Hawaiian Archipelago to estimate the risk of ROD to other islands. Given the potential for C. lukuohia to alter the structure of \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a dominated forests, we used our projected potential distribution of C. lukuohia to assess the risk of ROD to threatened and endangered plant species across Hawai\u2018i. Many native plants are likely vulnerable to these types of large \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a mortality events: of 234 endangered native plant species considered, 147 (62.8%) have more than half of their range within current and expanding C. lukuohia suitable areas. We also found evidence that protecting habitat by fencing out introduced feral ungulates reduces the prevalence of the disease likely by reducing physical damage caused by these animals to \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a trees, a precondition for Ceratocystis infection. Given the ongoing spread of C. lukuohia, we developed a dynamic web portal to host our results online, where models and analyses are updated with new lab-confirmed detections to provide managers with a useful tool to help monitor and assess the risk of C. lukuohia as it continues to spread."}{"On promoting the use of lidar systems in forest ecosystem research ": "Forest structure is an important driver of ecosystem dynamics, including the exchange of carbon, water and energy between canopies and the atmosphere. Structural descriptors are also used in numerous studies of ecological processes and ecosystem services. Over the last 20+ years, lidar technology has fundamentally changed the way we observe and describe forest structure, and it will continue to impact the ways in which we investigate and monitor the relations between forest structure and functions. Here we present the currently available lidar system types (ground, air, and space-based), we highlight opportunities and challenges associated with each system, as well as challenges associated with a wider use of lidar technology and wider availability of lidar derived products. We also suggest pathways for lidar to further contribute to addressing questions in forest ecosystem science and increase benefits to a wider community of researchers."}{"Modeling the height-diameter relationship of planted Pinus kesiya in Zambia ": "Plantations of non-native tree species cover over 50,000\u202fha in Zambia of which Pinus kesiya accounts for 36% of the main tree species. In order to quantify the growing stock of P. kesiya, updated and reliable height-diameter (h-d) models are required. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop appropriate h-d models for P. kesiya that are consistent with current forest management practices in the country. Using 7691 measured pairs of diameter and height of P. kesiya from four different forest sites, the following questions were investigated; (i) do frequently used h-d models accurately estimate height of P. kesiya in Zambia?; and (ii) what h-d models account for site and rotation in the country? Predicted h from the frequently used h-d models (N\u00e4slund, Modified Logistic and Hossfeld) was significantly lower than the measured h (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001). This suggests that frequently used h-d models for pine significantly underestimates tree height of P. kesiya in Zambia. The deviations associated with these models varied but generally increased with tree diameter. In this regard, country level h-d model developed using the Weibull function, and tested in this study proved to be more accurate than the frequently used models in predicting tree height of P. kesiya in Zambia. Furthermore, site and rotation were found to influence the overall accuracy and reliability of the country level model (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) suggesting the need to refine this model in order to account for site and/or rotation effect. Therefore, the h-d models that are specific to site and in some instances to rotation were derived and increased the accuracy and precision in estimating tree height of P. kesiya in the country. These locally developed h-d models are recommended for future forest plantation inventories, management planning and as a basis for modeling h-d relationships for other Pinus species in the country."}{"Overstory trees in excess: A threat to restoration success in Brazilian Atlantic forest ": "Tree planting is the most widely used technique for tropical forest restoration because it accelerates the recovery of forest structure and ecosystem functioning. Despite the importance of tree size distribution to the ecological function and habitat quality of restored forests, it has received little attention. Here we ask if the structure of reference forests has been recovered by planting tree seedlings and discuss the implications of skewed tree-size distributions for sustainability of restored forests. We sampled 11 tropical forest sites that had undergone restoration for between 16 and 53\u202fyears after planting tree seedlings and nine reference ecosystems (old-growth, secondary and degraded forests) in Brazilian Atlantic forest, and compared them by the abundance of individuals in five diameter classes. Restored forests presented 83% greater abundance of large trees (>20\u202fcm DBH), 41% lower abundance of saplings (1\u202f\u2264\u202fDBH\u202f<\u202f5\u202fcm) and 43% lower abundance of small trees (5\u202f\u2264\u202fDBH\u202f<\u202f10\u202fcm). The abundance of smaller individuals (DBH\u202f<\u202f1\u202fcm), however, did not differ between restored and reference forests, indicating successful colonization of the understorey. Low mortality in the large class (DBH\u202f\u2265\u202f20\u202fcm) results in excess of big trees, which constrains recruitment of small plants to the intermediate size classes, likely due to asymmetric competition for light. The excess of large trees demonstrates that gap dynamics can take longer to naturally re-establish in these even-aged forests, likely due to the high density of long-lived trees planted at the same time. Thinning may be a possible adaptive-management strategy to reduce the density of big trees and stimulate recruitment of intermediate size classes."}{"Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 in the like-minded megadiverse countries ": "The group of like-minded megadiverse countries (LMMCs), which harbours a wealth of biological and cultural diversity, adopted a Carta in 2016 to accelerate progress towards achieving Aichi Biodiversity Target 11. This paper presents the progress made over the last two years and an analysis of the LMMCs\u2019 national priority actions; approved Global Environment Facility, GEF-5 and GEF-6 protected area-related biodiversity projects; and relevant targets, goals, and actions from National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). Through their recent actions, these countries have contributed to progress in Target 11, especially with respect to marine protected area expansion, where they contributed one-sixth of the area added in national waters over the past two years. Results indicate that if implemented as planned, actions proposed by the LMMCs will increase terrestrial and marine protected area coverage by 1,106,148\u202fkm2 and 192,214\u202fkm2 respectively. Of these commitments, 227,230\u202fkm2 in terrestrial and 144,475\u202fkm2 in marine protected areas have the highest chance of being implemented. In total, 741 commitments were identified from the above sources, with implications on the qualitative elements of Target 11 (coverage of areas important for biodiversity, areas important for ecosystem services, ecological representation, connectivity, effective management, equitable management, and integration into the wider landscapes and seascapes). Of these 741 commitments, 25% showed a strong likelihood of being implemented. The country-level analysis of all commitments indicates that equitable management and integration will show the most progress, measured against identified gaps, if commitments are implemented as proposed. This progress on the qualitative elements of Target 11 in the LMMCs will also provide benefits and co-benefits for other Aichi Targets and for the requirements of other multi-lateral environmental agreements, as well as at the global level."}{"Incorporating landscape heterogeneity into multi-objective spatial planning improves biodiversity conservation of semi-natural grasslands ": "Recent actions to mitigate biodiversity loss in agricultural environments appear insufficient despite the considerable efforts channeled via the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy. One likely reason for this failure is the limited attention paid to the regional and landscape level ecological characteristics in farmland conservation planning. We demonstrate how to obtain conservation prioritization solutions that would address simultaneously three goals, including two landscape level targets: minimizing local habitat quality loss, maximizing habitat connectivity, and incorporating landscape heterogeneity. As these goals may be contradictory, we investigate the potential trade-offs between them. We used the Zonation prioritization tool to examine how our three goals could be implemented in the agricultural landscapes of southwest Finland. We used measures of (i) biodiversity value of grasslands, (ii) connectivity between grasslands, and (iii) landscape heterogeneity which comprised of (land cover type based) compositional heterogeneity and (field margin based) configurational heterogeneity. Integration of landscape heterogeneity measures and habitat connectivity resulted in some trade-offs with local habitat quality, the most prominent observation being that landscape heterogeneity co-varied with grassland connectivity. Among the two landscape heterogeneity parameters, inclusion of compositional heterogeneity resulted in more clustered prioritization solutions than configurational heterogeneity, which had a spatially more balanced impact. Concordance among landscape scale factors implies high potential for reconstruction of a functioning network of semi-natural grasslands in areas under intensive agricultural use. Broader scale multi-objective planning approaches can thus importantly support targeting biodiversity conservation planning and mediating the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy objectives."}{"Nature conservation on decommissioned military training areas \u2013 German approaches and experiences ": "Military training areas (MTAs) host high numbers of endangered habitats and species due to their large area, generally low fertilizer and biocide exposure, and a high dynamic of disturbances caused by military training activities. Since the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, thousands of former military properties have been closed due to international disarmament agreements. Based on a literature review, we present the importance of decommissioned MTAs in Germany for nature conservation, their number, area, and status, as well as the German approaches and experiences managing these sites. More than 119,000\u2009ha of former military areas of high conservation value were transferred by the Federal Government to German Federal States, the German Federal Environmental Foundation, and other nature conservation organizations as part of the so-called National Nature Heritage (NNH), and an additional 60,000\u2009ha were saved in other ways. It is a big challenge in nature conservation to establish appropriate management systems to maintain the endangered habitats and species on these sites, most of which are contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO). Several projects have been implemented in Germany to develop strategies to deal with UXO contamination. We discuss management options, from prescribed burning on UXO contaminated sites to the establishment of wilderness, in the light of the requirements of the European Union\u2019s Natura 2000 network of protected areas."}{"Does traditional and advanced guarding reduce crop losses due to wildlife? A comparative analysis from Africa and Asia ": "Crop damage caused by herbivorous wildlife species on farms located within conservation landscapes, is a driver of human-wildlife conflict (HWC). Guarding of farms, whereby farmers spend the night out in the fields, in areas adjacent to protected areas is, therefore, very common in many African and Asian countries. Furthermore, guarding is often combined with other crop protection measures, but little is known about the efficacy of these measures.\n                  We examined the effect that different traditional and advanced crop protection measures (active and passive guarding strategies, barriers and combinations of measures) had on the magnitude of damaged crops. For this, we examined the cost of crop damage caused by a total of 20 wildlife species in two African and two Asian study areas, where different protection types were applied. Data was compared with the cost of crop damage on unprotected fields. We continuously used a standardised HWC assessment scheme over six years (2009\u20132014), based on site observations and measurements in addition to interviews with victims.\n                  The analysis of crop damage costs revealed substantial losses, especially from that caused by elephants (Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus) and other large herbivores, such as zebra (Equus quagga) and common eland (Taurotragus oryx). Once wildlife had entered the farms, it was found that crop protection measures by farmers were only able to reduce damage costs when applied as a communal, strategic guarding system. Surprisingly, all other traditional crop protection strategies have proven ineffective in reducing crop damage costs. Electrical fences actually increased the risk of crop damage when combined with guarding and the chasing of wildlife strategies. Therefore, we recommend reviewing the practice of traditional guarding strategies and the effectiveness of fences. Furthermore, we emphasise the need for objective evaluation of HWC mitigation strategies in the long-term."}{"Understanding social demand for sustainable nature conservation. The case of a protected natural space in South-Eastern Spain ": "The implementation of sustainable management plans for protected areas is one of the main challenges for public institutions. These plans involve public participation and the assessment of social benefits provided by these open spaces. This work proposes the use of choice experiments methodology for the evaluation of management alternatives for a protected area. The case study within this work is El Valle and Carrascoy Natural Park, which is included in the Natura 2000 Network. This Protected Natural Area (PNA) is located in a peri-urban area; thus, it combines high natural values and high anthropic pressure. A Choice Experiment (CE) was designed through consultation with the Park managers and technicians, and it was applied to a representative sample of the population within the Region of Murcia (South-Eastern Spain). CE allowed an estimation of the value of different management alternatives, classified according to the three main sustainability areas: social; economic; and, environmental. The results show population's demand for environmental management alternatives, such as protection of flora and fauna and promotion of ecotourism, as well as a rejection of quarrying in the PNA. The economic values estimated allow the proposal of a distribution of the annual budget of the PNA according to the social demand."}{"Seventy-year chronology of Salinas in southern France: Coastal surfaces managed for salt production and conservation issues for abandoned sites ": "After World War II, twenty-nine coastal Salinas (122\u2009km2), located in the vicinity of coastal lagoons and in deltas, were exploited along the Mediterranean coastlines in South France. Today, only five of these are still actively producing salt, currently representing 175\u2009km2. Concomitant with the abandonment of many of the smaller Salinas, the larger Salinas in the Rh\u00f4ne delta (Camargue) strongly increased their surfaces at the expense of natural ecosystems, of which a part has also been abandoned after 2009. This paper documents these changes in landscape use by chronological GIS mapping and describes the fate of the 91\u2009km2 of abandoned Salina surfaces. The majority of this area (88\u2009km2) is included in the Natura 2000 network, among which most (74\u2009km2) has been acquired by the French coastal protection agency (Conservatoire du Littoral) to be designated as Protected Areas. Only a very minor part (<1%) has been lost for industry and harbour development. Managing abandoned Salinas as Protected Areas is a challenge, because of the different landscape, biodiversity conservation, natural and cultural heritages issues at stake. In two cases, abandoned Salinas have been brought back again into exploitation by private initiative thus allowing for the protection of original hypersaline biodiversity. In other cases, the shaping of the landscape by natural processes has been privileged. This has facilitated the spontaneous recreation of temporal Mediterranean wetlands with unique aquatic vegetation, and offered opportunities for managed coastal re-alignment and the restoration of hydrobiological exchanges between land and sea. In other areas, former salt ponds continue to be filled artificially by pumping favouring opportunities for waterfowl. This has often been combined with the creation of artificial islets to provide nesting ground for bird colonies protected from terrestrial predators."}{"Identifying high value areas for conservation: Accounting for connections among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats in a tropical island system ": "Functional ecosystems depend on biotic and abiotic connections among different environmental realms, including terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats. Accounting for such connections is increasingly recognized as critical for conservation of ecosystems, especially given growing understanding of the way in which anthropogenic landscape disturbances can degrade both freshwater and marine habitats. This need may be paramount in conservation planning for tropical island ecosystems, as habitats across realms are often in close proximity, and because endemic organisms utilize multiple habitats to complete life histories. In this study, we used Marxan analysis to develop conservation planning scenarios across the five largest islands of Hawaii, in one instance accounting for and in another excluding habitat connectivity between inland and coastal habitats. Native vegetation, perennial streams, and areas of biological significance along the coast were used as conservation targets in analysis. Cost, or the amount of effort required for conservation, was estimated using an index that integrated degree and intensity of anthropogenic landscape disturbances. Our results showed that when connectivity is accounted for among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats, areas identified as having high conservation value are substantially different compared to results when connectivity across realms is not considered. We also showed that the trade-off of planning conservation across realms was minimal and that cross-realm planning had the unexpected benefit of selecting areas with less habitat degradation, suggesting less effort for conservation. Our cross-realm planning approach considers biophysical interactions and complexity within and across ecosystems, as well as anthropogenic factors that may influence habitats outside of their physical boundaries, and we recommend implementing similar approaches to achieve integrated conservation efforts."}{"Structured and unstructured citizen science: Seven decades of expanding bird populations in central Ontario, Canada ": "Citizens\u2019 observations of wildlife offer a wealth of information. Such data, however, may be prone to biases or inaccuracies \u2014 in particular, the over-reporting of novel species and under-reporting of common or mundane species. Few studies have assessed the relationship between unstructured and structured observations using long-term data. We compared 69 years of voluntary bird sightings, recorded in the regular publication of Peterborough Field Naturalists (PFN), 1948\u20132016, to systematic Christmas Bird Counts (CBC; during winter) and Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS; during spring) in central Ontario, Canada. We focused on seven species that had expanded their ranges into the area: Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), Purple Finch (Haemorhous purpureus), Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius). For each species, we compared the first record, the annual number of sightings, and the annual relative abundance from the PFN to the first record and annual relative abundance in the CBC and BBS. We anticipated that naturalists\u2019 accounts would be more sensitive to the arrival of novel species but would underestimate abundance as the species became common.\n                  In general, our results agreed with these predictions. In 11 of 12 cases, the naturalists detected a species well in advance of the CBC and BBS \u2014 on average by 1\u00bd decades (range: 5\u201333 years). The correlations in bird abundance between unstructured (PFN) and structured (CBC and BBS) data were variable; most were weak and negative. We found significant negative correlations for the two most common species, Northern Cardinal (winter) and House Finch (spring), as well as for Wild Turkey (winter), and a positive correlation for the rarest species, the Red-bellied Woodpecker (spring). We surmise that novelty underlies these results \u2014 that rarity increases the likelihood of reporting by non-professionals. We conclude that unstructured observations are valuable in detecting novel species, but they may be inconsistent, even inverse, indicators of the abundance of expanding species, once established."}{"Law enforcement and deforestation: Lessons for Indonesia from Brazil ": "The Government of Indonesia has committed to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. However, the country suffers from one of the most significant illegal logging and illegal land clearing conditions in the world. Brazil was in a similar condition to Indonesia when it implemented an aggressive and strategic forest law enforcement policy which enable it to significantly reduce deforestation. Indonesia does not have such a strategic approach to forest law enforcement. It should consider the features of Brazil\u2019s strategy in order to improve its forest law enforcement activities in order to be able to deliver on the reduction of forest emissions that it has pledged in Nationally Determined Contributions statement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Indonesia\u2019s efforts, and those of other countries, would be enhanced by research on the reasons at the root of the unsuccessful forest law enforcement policies and activities over the two decades since the spotlight was put on illegal logging at the first Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade conference held in Bali in 2001."}{"Indonesia's land reform: Implications for local livelihoods and climate change ": "One of the main components of Indonesia's Just Economy policy is extensive and rapid land reform, which targets about 12% of the country's land area for redistribution to farmers and communities by 2019. Much of the reform is occurring on forest land. At the same time, the country has pledged a significant reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, two thirds of which is to be achieved from forests. Hence agrarian reform potentially conflicts with emission reduction commitments. This research analyses how the redistribution of forests, with emphasis on the social forestry program, might affect people's livelihoods and Indonesia's capacity to deliver on its climate change commitments. With reference to Central Kalimantan province, we find that the land reform policy has increased the area distributed to local people through the streamlining of processes. However, ambitious targets and hurried distribution of land have posed significant challenges for processes and implementation. They result in partial understanding of the schemes, rights and responsibilities, inappropriate site allocation and types of forestland being distributed, and inadequate consideration for community capacity and local governance. Importantly, the resources allocated to grant these rights have not been accompanied by equal attention to foster subsequent actual land-based livelihood activities and forest protection. Hence the reform's potential to improve local livelihoods and contribute to climate change mitigation in Central Kalimantan is unlikely to be fully realized in the near future. We suggest that careful consideration be given to the processes of distribution, the type of forests being assigned, attention and support to foster implementation, and monitoring and enforcement of regulations."}{"Forest and wildlife resource-conservation efforts based on indigenous knowledge: The case of Nharira community in Chikomba district, Zimbabwe ": "Forest and wildlife resources are indispensable for the provision of ecosystem goods and services; as well as spiritual and cultural values in rural areas. In most unprotected areas, these resources are increasingly under threat prompting indigenous communities to apply their local knowledge in an effort to conserve them. Therefore, this study documents how the Nharira community of Chikomba district, Zimbabwe is using indigenous knowledge to conserve forest and wildlife resources. Qualitative methods involving interviews and focus group discussions with villagers were used to gather data. The participants were purposively selected by the traditional leaders on the basis of their rich indigenous knowledge and participation in cultural ceremonies and rituals. The study found wide use of (a) customary rules and regulations, (b) customs and rituals, (c) taboos and totems, and (d) metaphors and proverbs applied in forest and wildlife resource conservation. These forms of indigenous knowledge constitute the social and religious values of the Nharira community that are used in conserving the human-environment system."}{"The role of science in forest policy\u2013Experiences by EFI ": "There has been increasing requests for evidence-based policy, especially in complex issues such as climate change, biodiversity and bioenergy questions. Scientists have also been active in this front, e.g., such as European Academies Science Advisory Council (2017, 2019) and by writing Open Letters (e.g., Beddington et al., 2017; De Wever et al., 2017; Berndes et al., 2018). However, at the same time, science expertise is contested. Populist \u201cpost-truth\u201d politicians and social media warriors have questioned the legitimacy of science-based information. The issue is made also more complex due to the fact that there has been occasionally striking disparity between what the scientists' messages are. Moreover, there is an increasing amount of science information available. According to UNESCO (2015), almost 1.3 million scientific articles were published in 2014 alone. Clearly, the decision-maker needs scientists and science-based intermediary organizations that can synthesize the best science information in a format that is easily accessible, as IPCC is doing. But science-policy support work has its own challenges, e.g., it can be impacted by pressures that mix science-evidence with vested interests. In this article, we address the following questions: What should the role of science be in informing forest policy-making? Why do scientists seem to disagree on forest issues? What are the lessons learnt from the European Forest Institute's (EFI) science-policy work since 2015?"}{"Developing community-based forest ecosystem service management to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ": "At the site level, communities who manage and conserve forests are parties influencing as well as affected by deforestation and forest degradation. Hence, understanding their roles in supporting or avoiding deforestation and forest degradation is important to support national effort in reducing carbon emissions from forest. This study is aimed at: (1) examining communities' needs for forest products and services; (2) analysing communities' interests towards REDD+ activities in reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation activities; and (3) analysing options to be developed into management plans for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. It examines 9 communities in the provinces of Papua, Central Kalimantan, and Riau. It employs a qualitative approach through stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions and field observations. The study found that communities face some constraints in managing forest ecosystem services that impede their role in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation that can be expected from the utilisation of non-timber forest products and ecosystem services. Communities' interests in joining programs to reduce emission from deforestation and forest degradation are diverse, but their capacity in planning and in systematic forest use, in including carbon conservation programs are relatively low. Hence, strengthening community-level organisational structures and developing robust plans for sustainable management of forest ecosystem services are needed to support communities' participation in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation."}{"Certification of tropical forests: A private instrument of public interest? A focus on the Congo Basin ": "Forest management certification seems to be stagnating or even receding in the Congo basin. This is attributable to the financial difficulties of some European companies, but might also be a consequence of unexpected interactions with the FLEGT process, which is lagging behind in the Congo Basin. Although this process and private certifications are expected to be complementary, the reluctance of EU authorities to give certified timber a \u201cgreen lane\u201d for entering the European market may discourage concessionaires from seeking a stringent certificate, while the demand for timber is increasingly shifting towards markets in China and other emerging countries that are not ready to pay a \u201cprice premium\u201d. An underlying issue is the difficulty in qualifying the added value of certified timber over legal timber, although some research has shown how certification has closed loopholes in public regulations. Recognition of the public interest of certification could be achieved through fully trusting private certificates for due diligence procedures and, eventually, for obtaining FLEGT licences. Public verification and traceability efforts would be re-centred on non-certified timber and the informal sector, which intersects with forest tenure issues. While some countries wish to make certification compulsory, this article prefers to propose the use of financial incentives through differentiated forest taxes, in order to preserve the credibility of standards, and it details potential mechanisms that could reinforce the independence of auditors."}{"Policies affecting the implementation of REDD+ in Indonesia (cases in Papua, Riau and Central Kalimantan) ": "Indonesia was expected to enter the implementing phase of REDD+ in 2015. Some technical and regulatory documents have been prepared within the framework of national REDD+ elemen. However, the development of REDD+ was constrained leading to the delay of the full implementation of REDD+. This study investigates the factors that may support or impede the effectiveness of REDD+ policies. It analyses policy structures and the behaviour of actors within and outside the forestry sector affecting the preparation of REDD+ implementation. The study was conducted in the three provinces of Papua, Central Kalimantan and Riau. The results show that most of the existing policy structures support REDD+ implementation. However, there are some regulations negatively impacting the implementation. Government actors at the central level have fragmented power, need for an actor that can manage coordination among the relevant actors. In addition, REDD+ documents and regulations are considered less legitimate and cannot fully support the implementation of REDD+ in Indonesia. Indonesia is not fully ready to implement national REDD+ since some current policies need to be improved to enhance the effectiveness of REDD+ policies."}{"Human values as catalysts and consequences of social innovations ": "We studied the role of human values in social innovations (SIs) in four forest-dependent communities (FDCs) in Europe. We draw on 71 semi-structured interviews with FDC members in Finland, Slovenia, the UK and Ukraine, and a survey of householders (n\u202f=\u202f150) and focus group interviews with related stakeholders in Ukraine. The material collected was analyzed with mixed methods with respect to relational values as catalysts and consequences of SI. Relational values, which are derivative of the relationships between human and non-human world, and responsibilities towards these relationships, were divided into three categories: Doing, Belonging and Respecting. Doing encompasses the individual's perspective of the opportunities offered by nature to individuals. Belonging encompasses a communal dimension of values manifested as the experience of \u201cbeing at home\u201d in social collectives and landscapes. Respecting addresses environmental and social justice. Common cause for SI was the need of FDCs to sustain or enhance relational values linked to forests while, once emerged, SIs also have potential to become global game-changers. SI encompasses the reconfiguration of: i) forest management and use, ii) decision-making structures and processes, and iii) stakeholder's perceptions of sustainability. Examples include the co-management arrangement between a State forestry enterprise and the local community, buying woodland from the State by the FDCs to enable community forestry, reinvention of traditional forest management, and the active involvement of FDC members in halting illegal logging. As a conclusion, we developed a general value hierarchy accounting for value plurality in which relational, instrumental and intrinsic values can be interpreted from any perspective."}{"Effects of carnivore presence on hunting lease pricing in South Sweden ": "Carnivore conservation is considered essential because the species offer significant benefits to biodiversity. However, their predation on ungulates reduces ungulate populations with subsequent effects on hunters' harvests and welfare. In this paper, we use the hedonic price method to estimate the effects of large carnivores on hunting lease prices. We disentangle the impact of carnivores through their effect on game harvest from their effect on hunters' preferences. Results reveal that lynx impose a significant economic cost to owners of hunting rights due to the predation of game. On average, the implicit cost of an additional lynx family is SEK 1.51 million (EUR 0.162 million) per year, and with 95% certainty, the cost per lynx family is at least SEK 340 thousand (EUR 36.6 thousand) per year."}{"Reducing emissions from land use change in Indonesia: An overview ": "The goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change cannot be achieved without a significant reduction in emissions from forests. Reductions of emissions from land use, particularly forests, account for a quarter of the reductions pledged in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by Parties to the UNFCCC. The papers included in this Special Issue of Forest Policy and Economics provide a contribution to the analysis of the design and implementation of the NDCs and REDD+ by considering aspects of reducing emissions from forests in Indonesia. Indonesia is the second largest emitter of greenhouses gases from forest after Brazil, but it becomes the largest emitter from forests in years when it experiences significant forest and peat fires."}{"REDD+ engagement types preferred by Japanese private firms: The challenges and opportunities in relation to private sector participation ": "This article examines the REDD+ engagement types preferred by Japanese private firms at the project level including their motivation and rationale for the engagement and explores the challenges and opportunities in relation to their participation. We analyzed 148 responses to a survey questionnaire mailed to participants across Japan and the responses from in-depth face-to-face interviews with representatives from 11 selected firms. 42 firms (28%) stated that they are interested in engaging in REDD+-related activities in the future. Of these, 33 firms aim to enhance their corporate values, while the other nine aim to increase profits. The most popular engagement types were providing support, as a form of corporate social responsibility (CSR), to third parties such as NGOs that are engaged in REDD+ projects (21 firms) and purchasing REDD+ carbon credits derived from REDD+ projects to offset the greenhouse gases emitted by the firm (or carbon-neutral CSR) (18 firms). The firms would be willing to participate in REDD+ in some form in the future if some of the current challenges are addressed. These challenges included: few opportunities for firms seeking attractive \u201cstories\u201d in forest conservation to pair with local partners that can help to realize the firms' \u201cstories\u201d or desires; difficulties in gaining understanding and trust from host countries' governments/communities; and the lack of a consortium to implement REDD+-related activities by bundling firms that find it difficult to work alone. It was also confirmed that some firms seeking profits from REDD+ carbon credit development and trading activities continue to face barriers commonly identified in earlier studies such as market uncertainty, unclear regulatory frameworks, and the costs of measuring, reporting, and verifying the carbon credits. However, the present study did not support the findings of earlier studies that the cost of CSR activities is considered to be relatively high because CSR budgeting is often based on time horizons of less than 5\u202fyears. We propose some policy initiatives designed to increase private sector participation in REDD+ that will contribute to achieving the host countries' mitigation targets in relation to both REDD+ and nationally determined contributions."}{"Village transfers for the environment: Lessons from community-based development programs and the village fund ": ""}{"Assessment and optimization of sustainable forest wood supply chains \u2013 A systematic literature review ": "When it was first introduced, the concept of sustainability in the forestry sector had a narrow focus on sustainable wood production. Since then, this concept has evolved and it now considers now the three sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental and social) of the whole forest wood supply chain. The main objective of this study is then to review assessment and optimization studies that consider the forest wood supply chain and at least one of the sustainability dimensions. To accomplish this goal, a total number of 188 papers, published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals from 1995 to 2017, were reviewed. These papers have been classified according to the sustainability dimensions explored, the stakeholder\u2019s involvement, the modeling approaches applied, the supply chain decision levels treated, the uncertainty inclusion, and case study analyzed. Most of the studies reviewed (84.6%) considered only two sustainability dimensions: economic (31.9%), environmental (13.8%), or a combination of both (38.8%). The first study including the three sustainability dimensions was published in 2005. Most of the studies reviewed (64.9%) focus on the bioenergy industry in Europe and North America, due to the growing interest in using biomass to substitute fossil fuels in energy production. The final part of the paper presents the identified specific features of sustainable forest wood supply chains and discusses a future research agenda in the area."}{"Protected areas, household environmental incomes and well-being in the Greater Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem ": "Protected areas are an important cornerstone in the attempt to halt habitat and species losses. While it is widely recognized that local communities impact on conservation outcomes, there is a limited understanding of the economic importance of environmental resources in protected areas to local household incomes and well-being. This inhibits the development and implementation of efficient conservation policies. This paper, using the iconic case of the Greater Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem and its surrounding local communities in Tanzania and Kenya, quantifies the household-level economic importance of this protected area. Data was collected using well-being and environmentally augmented structured household surveys administered to 985 randomly selected households in 25 communities. Results documented high reliance on environmental income of the poorest, a negative relationship between environmental reliance and well-being, with households closer to the protected area having higher environmental reliance and lower well-being. Hence, degradation of protected area habitats will negatively and disproportionately affect the income and may further reduce the well-being of the poorest households. Sustainable protected area management must address human well-being as well as conservation objectives. Increasing access to education and building skills to promote alternative non-environmental based livelihood activities will promote both conservation and development objectives."}{"Teaching master thesis writing to engineers: Insights from corpus and genre analysis of introductions ": "A large proportion of all graduates study engineering disciplines, and the number of master theses completed far outstrips that of doctoral-level works. However, engineering disciplines in general and their master theses in particular have received comparatively little attention from applied linguistics, leaving writing instructors with sparse guidance when preparing courses for MSc students in engineering. Here, we present the results of a corpus analysis of introduction sections in 57 master theses in mechanical engineering and a genre analysis of 16 of their introductions. A concordance analysis of the most frequent keywords revealed the typical discourse functions employed by students when writing about their research in this section. The genre analysis confirmed the presence of most of the elements of Swales's CARS schema in MSc theses. These findings contribute to knowledge of this understudied field in applied linguistics and can be used to design materials and courses for MSc engineering students focussing on vocabulary, rhetorical structures, and academic socialisation."}{"Assessing the accuracy and teachers' impressions of Google Translate: A study of primary L2 writers in Hong Kong ": ""}{"Learning English Through Workplace Communication: Linguistic devices for interpersonal meaning in textbooks in Hong Kong ": "Using language to establish and maintain interpersonal relationships contributes to effective workplace communication. Importantly, language plays a significant role in constructing professional role and identity, building solidarity and rapport, presenting comments and views, and facilitating collaboration and problem-solving in the workplace. Yet, the teaching of workplace interpersonal language is under-researched, and the extent to which such teaching materials, in particular textbooks, can assist ESP teachers in the classroom is unknown. In this article, we report on a study which evaluates textbooks designed for a module on learning workplace English in the senior secondary curriculum in Hong Kong. Specifically, it examines the textbooks, both qualitatively and quantitatively, regarding the presentation and teaching of linguistic devices of four broad areas of interpersonal meaning in different written and spoken workplace text-types and student activities. While linguistic devices in all the four broad areas of interpersonal meaning are identified, some areas, and most of the linguistic devices, are not given sufficient attention. The article therefore recommends that the textbooks should address the deficiencies identified and present interpersonal language in the workplace much more explicitly. It also highlights the need for ESP teachers to not exclusively rely on textbooks for teaching interpersonal language."}{"Quantifying the impact of language on the performance of international accounting students: A cognitive load theory perspective ": "This study offers timely empirical evidence of the magnitude of the language effect on the performance of different language user groups, namely English as a Foreign Language (EFL), English as a Second Language (ESL), and English as a Native Language (ENL) in an accounting program instructed in English, an area that has been under researched. Informed by Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), this study develops an innovative research methodology (crossover repeated measures design), drawing on a large data analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a02912) of students' academic results in six accounting specialisation subjects between 2007 and 2014 in an Australian university's undergraduate accounting program. Results show that while all language user groups perform worse in more conceptually (MC) oriented subjects compared to less conceptually (LC) oriented subjects, the relative performance between MC and LC is strongly related to English language user groups. For the first time the magnitude of the impact is derived. The study has implications for the instructional design of accounting programs in English-speaking universities and their offshore programs in non-English speaking countries."}{"The benefits of explicit teaching of language for curriculum learning in the physical education classroom ": "Among the many subjects taught at primary, secondary and tertiary institutions physical education (PE) has had limited discussion with respect to the language of PE. As an examination subject in secondary school, physical performance is one key factor leading to success in PE; however, PE disciplinary knowledge is often assessed through written or spoken texts, resulting in students needing to have both the ability to physically perform and the disciplinary literacy required to demonstrate knowledge of the subject. The present paper extends the discussion of content and language integrated learning (CLIL), by providing a theory of language and a pedagogy informed by systemic functional linguistics; and investigating the benefits of the explicit teaching of curriculum language related to PE in order to prepare students to succeed in PE exams. Data including observations and videos of classroom interaction, texts written by students and interviews with teachers and students were collected at Hamstead Hall Academy, Birmingham, UK, where over 50% of students have English as an additional language. The data were analysed to investigate if the explicit teaching of the language of PE had a positive impact on both teachers and students. In focussing specifically on the language of PE, the teachers became more aware of the role of language as meaning making resource, students' written assignments improved and overall the PE exam results increased dramatically. These findings illustrate the benefit of explicitly teaching discipline specific language for curriculum learning, and highlight the language of PE, which tends to be a marginalised subject in the discussion of ESP."}{"An innovative approach in the detection of Toxocara canis excretory/secretory antigens using specific nanobodies ": "Human toxocariasis is a zoonosis resulting from the migration of larval stages of the dog parasite Toxocara canis into the human paratenic host. Despite its well-known limitations, serology remains the most important tool to diagnose the disease. Our objective was to employ camelid single domain antibody fragments also known as nanobodies (Nbs) for a specific and sensitive detection of Toxocara canis excretory/secretory (TES) antigens. From an alpaca immune Nb library, we retrieved different Nbs with specificity for TES antigens. Based on ELISA experiments, these Nbs did not show any cross-reactivity with Ascaris lumbricoides, Ascaris suum, Pseudoterranova decipiens, Anisakis simplex and Angiostrongylus cantonensis larval antigens. Western blot and immunocapturing revealed that Nbs 1TCE39, 1TCE52 and 2TCE49 recognise shared epitopes on different components of TES antigen. The presence of disulphide bonds in the target antigen seems to be essential for recognition of the epitopes by these three Nbs. Three separate sandwich ELISA formats, using monovalent and bivalent Nbs, were assessed to maximise the detection of TES antigens in solution. The combination of biotinylated, bivalent Nb 2TCE49 on a streptavidin pre-coated plate to capture TES antigens, and Nb 1TCE39 chemically coupled to horseradish peroxidase for detection of the captured TES antigens, yielded the most sensitive ELISA with a limit of detection of 0.650\u202fng/ml of TES antigen, spiked in serum. Moreover, the assay was able to detect TES antigens in sera from mice, taken 3\u202fdays after the animals were experimentally infected with T. canis. The specific characteristics of Nbs make this ELISA not only a promising tool for the detection of TES antigens in clinical samples, but also for a detailed structural and functional study of TES antigens."}{"Generation and functional characterisation of Plasmodium yoelii csp deletion mutants using a microhomology-based CRISPR/Cas9 method ": "CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful genome editing method that has greatly facilitated functional studies in many eukaryotic organisms including malaria parasites. Due to the lack of genes encoding enzymes necessary for the non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway, genetic manipulation of malaria parasite genomes is generally accomplished through homologous recombination requiring the presence of DNA templates. Recently, an alternative double-strand break repair pathway, microhomology-mediated end joining, was found in the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. Taking advantage of the MMEJ pathway, we developed a MMEJ-based CRISPR/Cas9 (mCRISPR) strategy to efficiently generate multiple mutant parasites simultaneously in genes with repetitive sequences. As a proof of principle, we successfully produced various size mutants in the central repeat region of the Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite surface protein without the use of template DNA. Monitoring mixed parasite populations and individual parasites with different sizes of CSP-CRR showed that the CSP-CRR plays a role in the development of mosquito stages, with severe developmental defects in parasites with large deletions in the repeat region. However, the majority of the csp mutant parasite clones grew similarly to the wild type P. yoelii 17XL parasite in mice. This study develops a useful technique to efficiently generate mutant parasites with deletions or insertions, and shows that the CSP-CRR plays a role in parasite development in mosquito."}{"Trypanosomatid parasites infecting managed honeybees and wild solitary bees ": "The parasite Crithidia mellificae (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae) infects honeybees, Apis mellifera. No pathogenic effects have been found in individual hosts, despite positive correlations between infections and colony mortalities. The solitary bee Osmia cornuta might constitute a host, but controlled infections are lacking to date. Here, we challenged male and female O. cornuta and honeybee workers in laboratory cages with C. mellificae. No parasite cells were found in any control. Parasite numbers increased 6.6 fold in honeybees between days 6 and 19 p.i. and significantly reduced survival. In O. cornuta, C. mellificae numbers increased 2\u20133.6 fold within cages and significantly reduced survival of males, but not females. The proportion of infected hosts increased in O. cornuta cages with faeces, but not in honeybee cages without faeces, suggesting faecal \u2013 oral transmission. The data show that O. cornuta is a host of C. mellificae and suggest that males are more susceptible. The higher mortality of infected honeybees proposes a mechanism for correlations between C. mellificae infections and colony mortalities."}{"Evolutionary sex allocation theory explains sex ratios in natural Plasmodium falciparum infections ": "Malaria transmission is achieved by sexual stages, called gametocytes, and the proportion of gametocytes that are male versus female (sex ratio) influences transmission success. In malaria model systems, variation in gametocyte sex ratios can be explained by the predictions of evolutionary sex allocation theory. We test these predictions using natural Plasmodium falciparum infections. The predicted negative correlation between sex ratio and gametocyte density holds: the sex ratio increases when gametocyte densities decrease, and this is most apparent in single genotype infections and in the dry season. We do not observe higher gametocyte sex ratios in mixed compared with single genotype infections."}{"Rhoptry neck protein 11 has crucial roles during malaria parasite sporozoite invasion of salivary glands and hepatocytes ": "The malaria parasite sporozoite sequentially invades mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes; and is the Plasmodium lifecycle infective form mediating parasite transmission by the mosquito vector. The identification of several sporozoite-specific secretory proteins involved in invasion has revealed that sporozoite motility and specific recognition of target cells are crucial for transmission. It has also been demonstrated that some components of the invasion machinery are conserved between erythrocytic asexual and transmission stage parasites. The application of a sporozoite stage-specific gene knockdown system in the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, enables us to investigate the roles of such proteins previously intractable to study due to their essentiality for asexual intraerythrocytic stage development, the stage at which transgenic parasites are derived. Here, we focused on the rhoptry neck protein 11 (RON11) that contains multiple transmembrane domains and putative calcium-binding EF-hand domains. PbRON11 is localised to rhoptry organelles in both merozoites and sporozoites. To repress PbRON11 expression exclusively in sporozoites, we produced transgenic parasites using a promoter-swapping strategy. PbRON11-repressed sporozoites showed significant reduction in attachment and motility in vitro, and consequently failed to efficiently invade salivary glands. PbRON11 was also determined to be essential for sporozoite infection of the liver, the first step during transmission to the vertebrate host. RON11 is demonstrated to be crucial for sporozoite invasion of both target host cells \u2013 mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes \u2013 via involvement in sporozoite motility."}{"\n               Schistosoma mansoni venom allergen-like proteins: phylogenetic relationships, stage-specific transcription and tissue localization as predictors of immunological cross-reactivity ": "Schistosoma mansoni venom allergen-like proteins (SmVALs) are part of a diverse protein superfamily partitioned into two groups (group 1 and group 2). Phylogenetic analyses of group 1 SmVALs revealed that members could be segregated into subclades (A\u2013D); these subclades share similar gene expression patterns across the parasite lifecycle and immunological cross-reactivity. Furthermore, whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that the phylogenetically, transcriptionally and immunologically-related SmVAL4, 10, 18 and 19 (subclade C) were all localized to the pre-acetabular glands of immature cercariae. Our results suggest that SmVAL group 1 phylogenetic relationships, stage-specific transcriptional profiles and tissue localization are predictive of immunological cross-reactivity."}{"Metagenomics for broad and improved parasite detection: a proof-of-concept study using swine faecal samples ": "Efficient and reliable identification of emerging pathogens is crucial for the design and implementation of timely and proportionate control strategies. This is difficult if the pathogen is so far unknown or only distantly related with known pathogens. Diagnostic metagenomics \u2013 an undirected, broad and sensitive method for the efficient identification of pathogens \u2013 was frequently used for virus and bacteria detection, but seldom applied to parasite identification. Here, metagenomics datasets prepared from swine faeces using an unbiased sample processing approach with RNA serving as starting material were re-analysed with respect to parasite detection. The taxonomic identification tool RIEMS, used for initial detection, provided basic hints on potential pathogens contained in the datasets. The suspected parasites/intestinal protists (Blastocystis, Entamoeba, Iodamoeba, Neobalantidium, Tetratrichomonas) were verified using subsequently applied reference mapping analyses on the base of rRNA sequences. Nearly full-length gene sequences could be extracted from the RNA-derived datasets. In the case of Blastocystis, subtyping was possible with subtype (ST)15 discovered for the first known time in swine faeces. Using RIEMS, some of the suspected candidates turned out to be false-positives caused by the poor status of sequences in publicly available databases. Altogether, 11 different species/STs of parasites/intestinal protists were detected in 34 out of 41 datasets extracted from metagenomics data. The approach operates without any primer bias that typically hampers the analysis of amplicon-based approaches, and allows the detection and taxonomic classification including subtyping of protist and metazoan endobionts (parasites, commensals or mutualists) based on an abundant biomarker, the 18S rRNA. The generic nature of the approach also allows evaluation of interdependencies that induce mutualistic or pathogenic effects that are often not clear for many intestinal protists and perhaps other parasites. Thus, metagenomics has the potential for generic pathogen identification beyond the characterisation of viruses and bacteria when starting from RNA instead of DNA."}{"Removal of adult cyathostomins alters faecal microbiota and promotes an inflammatory phenotype in horses ": "The interactions between parasitic helminths and gut microbiota are considered to be an important, although as yet incompletely understood, factor in the regulation of immunity, inflammation and a range of diseases. Infection with intestinal helminths is ubiquitous in grazing horses, with cyathostomins (about 50 species of which are recorded) predominating. Consequences of infection include both chronic effects, and an acute inflammatory syndrome, acute larval cyathostominosis, which sometimes follows removal of adult helminths by administration of anthelmintic drugs. The presence of cyathostomins as a resident helminth population of the equine gut (the \u201chelminthome\u201d) provides an opportunity to investigate the effect helminth infection, and its perturbation, has on both the immune system and bacterial microbiome of the gut, as well as to determine the specific mechanisms of pathophysiology involved in equine acute larval cyathostominosis. We studied changes in the faecal microbiota of two groups of horses following treatment with anthelmintics (fenbendazole or moxidectin). We found decreases in both alpha diversity and beta diversity of the faecal microbiota at Day 7 post-treatment, which were reversed by Day 14. These changes were accompanied by increases in inflammatory biomarkers. The general pattern of faecal microbiota detected was similar to that seen in the relatively few equine gut microbiome studies reported to date. We conclude that interplay between resident cyathostomin populations and the bacterial microbiota of the equine large intestine is important in maintaining homeostasis and that disturbance of this ecology can lead to gut dysbiosis and play a role in the aetiology of inflammatory conditions in the horse, including acute larval cyathostominosis."}{"Out-of-Africa, human-mediated dispersal of the common cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis: The hitchhiker\u2019s guide to world domination ": "The cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) is the most common parasite of domestic cats and dogs worldwide. Due to the morphological ambiguity of C. felis and a lack of \u2014 particularly largescale \u2014 phylogenetic data, we do not know whether global C. felis populations are morphologically and genetically conserved, or whether human-mediated migration of domestic cats and dogs has resulted in homogenous global populations. To determine the ancestral origin of the species and to understand the level of global pervasion of the cat flea and related taxa, our study aimed to document the distribution and phylogenetic relationships of Ctenocephalides fleas found on cats and dogs worldwide. We investigated the potential drivers behind the establishment of regional cat flea populations using a global collection of fleas from cats and dogs across six continents. We morphologically and molecularly evaluated six out of the 14 known taxa comprising genus Ctenocephalides, including the four original C. felis subspecies (Ctenocephalides felis felis, Ctenocephalides felis strongylus, Ctenocephalides felis orientis and Ctenocephalides felis damarensis), the cosmopolitan species Ctenocephalides canis and the African species Ctenocephalides connatus. We confirm the ubiquity of the cat flea, representing 85% of all fleas collected (4357/5123). Using a multigene approach combining two mitochondrial (cox1 and cox2) and two nuclear (Histone H3 and EF-1\u03b1) gene markers, as well as a cox1 survey of 516 fleas across 56 countries, we demonstrate out-of-Africa origins for the genus Ctenocephalides and high levels of genetic diversity within C. felis. We define four bioclimatically limited C. felis clusters (Temperate, Tropical I, Tropical II and African) using maximum entropy modelling. This study defines the global distribution, African origin and phylogenetic relationships of global Ctenocephalides fleas, whilst resolving the taxonomy of the C. felis subspecies and related taxa. We show that humans have inadvertently precipitated the expansion of C. felis throughout the world, promoting diverse population structure and bioclimatic plasticity. By demonstrating the link between the global cat flea communities and their affinity for specific bioclimatic niches, we reveal the drivers behind the establishment and success of the cat flea as a global parasite."}{"Transcriptome and histone epigenome of Plasmodium vivax salivary-gland sporozoites point to tight regulatory control and mechanisms for liver-stage differentiation in relapsing malaria ": "Plasmodium vivax is the key obstacle to malaria elimination in Asia and Latin America, largely attributed to its ability to form resilient hypnozoites (sleeper cells) in the host liver that escape treatment and cause relapsing infections. The decision to form hypnozoites is made early in the liver infection and may already be set in sporozoites prior to invasion. To better understand these early stages of infection, we undertook a comprehensive transcriptomic and histone epigenetic characterization of P. vivax sporozoites. Through comparisons with recently published proteomic data for the P. vivax sporozoite, our study found that although highly transcribed, transcripts associated with functions needed for early infection of the vertebrate host are not detectable as proteins and may be regulated through translational repression. We identified differential transcription between the sporozoite and published transcriptomes of asexual blood stages and mixed versus hypnozoite-enriched liver stages. These comparisons point to multiple layers of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational control that appear active in sporozoites and to a lesser extent hypnozoites, but are largely absent in replicating liver schizonts or mixed blood stages. We also characterised histone epigenetic modifications in the P. vivax sporozoite and explored their role in regulating transcription. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the sporozoite is a tightly programmed stage to infect the human host and identify mechanisms for hypnozoite formation that may be further explored in liver stage models."}{"Reprint of: Motivational active learning: An integrated approach to teaching and learning process control ": "Process Control is a course that needs a thorough understanding of how the different unit operations work and what are the implications of changing operation variables in a process. This paper presents how education innovation can help students to improve their learning and understanding of the different concepts and thus to get better results in the subject and to achieve the desired outcomes. The Process Control Course is taught in the Bachelor Degree in Chemical Engineering at the Technical University of Madrid. Different methodologies have been integrated and used in the course as: flipped classroom, peer instruction or gamification. In order to implement the mentioned methods, the following material has been developed: screencasts, concept tests, trivia contest and simulations besides the traditional lecturing material (slides and text). First year results show high student motivation, higher participation in class and better results (marks) in the subject."}{"Assessing the performance of UK universities in the field of chemical engineering using data envelopment analysis ": "University rankings have become an important tool to compare academic institutions within and across countries. Yet, they rely on aggregated scores based on subjective weights which render them sensitive to experts\u2019 preferences and not fully transparent to final users. To overcome this limitation, we apply Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate UK universities in the field of chemical engineering as a case study, using data retrieved from two national rankings. DEA is a non-parametric approach developed for the multi-criteria assessment of entities that avoids the use of subjective weightings and aggregated scores; this is accomplished by calculating an efficiency index, on the basis of which universities can be classified as either \u2018efficient\u2019 or \u2018inefficient\u2019. Our analysis shows that the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) occupying the highest positions in the chemical engineering rankings might not be the most efficient ones, and vice versa, which highlights the need to complement the use of rankings with other analytical tools. Overall, DEA provides further insight into the assessment of HEIs, allowing institutions to better understand their weaknesses and strengths, while pinpointing sources of inefficiencies where improvement efforts must be directed."}{"Applying PBL methodologies to the chemical engineering courses: Unit operations and modeling and simulation, using a joint course project ": "Unit Operations and Modelling and Simulation have been for long time a staple of the academic formation of any chemical engineer. Both are integral to the analysis of any chemical process, discretizing it into smaller specific processes that can then be characterized and modelled through the solution of balance, thermodynamics and transport equations. However, students usually perceive these subjects as separate fields of knowledge, and they do not develop the ability to correlate and integrate them to solve real-world problems in their future profession. On account of this, a Project-Based Learning (PBL) methodology was proposed in the redesign of the abovementioned undergraduate courses, focusing initially in Unit Operations. This PBL method was implemented alongside a joint course project, consisting on the design, assembly and characterization of a centrifugal pump, to be analyzed experimentally and computationally. To assess the success of this methodology, a survey was conducted on the students after they finished their courses. The results were mostly positive (85%), as the students appreciated the design component of the project, considering that it benefits their learning process, as well as the challenge it presented. This difficulty forced them to resort to different sources of information and areas of knowledge, alien to those provided in the courses. The limitations of the chosen project revolved around its limited scope and lack of connection with other topics of the courses (i.e. distillation columns). These limitations will be addressed with the design of transversal projects, which can cover more of the subjects seen in both classes."}{"Developing a framework for assessing teaching effectiveness in higher education ": "Evaluating the effectiveness of teaching and learning core knowledge outcomes and professional skills is a highly challenging task that has not yet been satisfactorily addressed at higher education level. The iTeach European project consortium developed a framework for assessing the effectiveness of various pedagogical methodologies in chemical engineering education, including those aiming to promote important core competencies related to employability, in a range of geographical and educational contexts.\n                  The framework was firstly implemented in a core chemical engineering area (reaction engineering) to check its usability and robustness, and subsequently was also tested on a range of subject areas from various branches of engineering and other disciplines, one of which is analysed in more detail in this contribution. The results of this broader assessment encompassed a much more diverse student body with varying educational experiences and a wider range of different teaching methodologies. The outcomes of this assessment are highlighted and the benefits of such an objective approach for evaluating teaching effectiveness is discussed."}{"Reprint of: Education of chemical engineering in Spain: A global picture ": "The general framework of the Chemical Engineering studies in Spain includes the Bachelor's Degree (4 years), Master's Degree (the most common duration is 1.5 years) and Doctorate (3-4 years). In 2008, the Conference of Directors and Deans of Chemical Engineering (CODDIQ) was constituted with the main objective of promoting and improving the quality of Chemical Engineering studies in Spain. Currently, Faculties and Schools of 29 Spanish universities are members of CODDIQ. An analysis of the most characteristic indicators provides a representative radiography of the Chemical Engineering Studies in Spain, whose most outstanding data are: (i) 7,396 undergraduate students, 1,014 Master students and 556 PhD students, (ii) according to the gender profile of undergraduates and graduates, the percentage of women is similar to that of men, while for faculty staff, the percentage of women is 43% and 46% for Associate and Assistant Professor (respectively) and 23% for the category of Full Professor category; (iii) after completing the Bachelor studies, most of them continue their training in the MSc in Chemical Engineering, (iv) the employability after obtaining the Master's degree is very high (>75%), which in the case of PhDs is close to 100%. The studies of Chemical Engineering in Spain have a very direct relationship with society, especially in the chemical, environmental, biotechnological and energy fields. The companies that collaborate in the training of future professionals are distributed throughout the national territory, which allows a strong connection with the socioeconomic environment."}{"New chemical engineering provision: Quality in diversity ": "Recent growth in chemical engineering student numbers has driven an increase in the number of UK universities offering the subject. The implications of this growth are described, along with the different challenges facing new providers in the UK compared with established departments. The approaches taken by the various new entrants are reviewed, with reference to recruitment strategies, infrastructure, the use of external facilities, and the particular flavours of chemical engineering being offered by the new providers. Information about the differentiating features of the large number of chemical engineering degree courses now available is somewhat indistinct: this should be rectified in the interests both of prospective students and of employers. Dilemmas facing new providers include the need to address the fundamentals of the subject as well as moving into more novel research-led areas; enabling students to develop the competencies to sustain them for a whole career as well as meeting immediate employer needs; and providing sufficient industry understanding when academics may lack substantial industrial experience. The central importance of practical provision and of the design project, and the approaches taken by new providers to deliver these components, are reviewed, together with the role of software tools in chemical engineering education, and measures to facilitate industry input into courses. As long as it is not used prescriptively or to inhibit innovation, the accreditation process provides constructive guidance and leverage for universities developing new chemical engineering programmes."}{"A framework for hands-on learning in chemical engineering education\u2014Training students with the end goal in mind ": "Chemical engineering education aims to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and hands-on capability to solve practical problems. At Imperial College London, this is practiced via three laboratory-based courses, which span over the first three years of the undergraduate curriculum. The Foundation, Knowledge and Discovery Laboratories were designed based on Kolb\u2019s experiential learning theory as well as Vygotsky\u2019s zone of proximal development. Although these courses intend to challenge students, appropriate scaffolding is in place to ensure a satisfactory learning experience across the spectrum of abilities. Assessment and survey results show that all students were capable of meeting the learning goals (>96% achieving satisfactory to excellent results in academic years 2014\u20132016), while a large majority is satisfied with the courses (>80% in academic years 2014\u20132016). The design and implementation of these courses are discussed to promote the exchange of good practices within the higher education community."}{"Learning distillation by a combined experimental and simulation approach in a three steps laboratory: Vapor pressure, vapor-liquid equilibria and distillation column ": "Distillation is one of the most important separation process in industrial chemistry. This operation is based on a deep knowledge of the fluid phase equilibria involved in the mixture to be separated. In particular, the most important aspects are the determination of the vapor pressures of the single compounds and the correct representation of the eventual not ideality of the mixture. Simulation science is a fundamental tool for managing these complex topics and chemical engineers students have to learn and to use it on real case-studies. To give to the students a complete overview of these complex aspects, a laboratory experience is proposed. Three different work stations were set up: i) determination of vapor pressure of two pure compounds; ii) the study of vapor-liquid equilibria of a binary mixture; iii) the use of a continuous multistage distillation column in dynamic and steady-state conditions. The simulation of all these activities by a commercial software, PRO II by AVEVA, allows to propose and verify the thermodynamic characteristics of the mixture and to correctly interpret the distillation column data. Moreover, the experimental plants and the data elaboration by classical equations are presented. The students are request to prepare a final report in which the description of the experimental plants and experimental procedure, the interpretation of the results and the simulation study are critically discussed in order to encourage them to reason and to acquire the concepts of the course.\n                  Two different questionnaires each with 7 questions, for the course and for the laboratory, are proposed and analyzed. The final evaluation of the students was strongly positive both for the course as a whole and for the proposed laboratory activities."}{"Forecasting Indonesia's electricity load through 2030 and peak demand reductions from appliance and lighting efficiency ": "Indonesia's electricity demand is growing rapidly, driven by robust economic growth combined with unprecedented urbanization and industrialization. Energy-efficiency improvements could reduce the country's electricity demand, thus providing monetary savings, greenhouse gas and other pollutant reductions, and improved energy security. Perhaps most importantly, using energy efficiency to lower peak electricity demand could reduce the risk of economically damaging power shortages while freeing up funds that would otherwise be used for power plant construction. We use a novel bottom-up modeling approach to analyze the potential of energy efficiency to reduce Indonesia's electricity demand: the LOAD curve Model (LOADM) combines total national electricity demand for each end use\u2014as modeled by the Bottom-Up Energy Analysis System (BUENAS)\u2014with hourly end-use demand profiles. We find that Indonesia's peak demand may triple between 2010 and 2030 in a business-as-usual case, to 77.3\u202fGW, primarily driven by air conditioning and with important contributions from lighting and refrigerators. However, we also show that appliance and lighting efficiency improvements could hold the peak demand increase to a factor of two, which would avoid 26.5\u202fGW of peak demand in 2030. These results suggest that well-understood programs, such as minimum efficiency performance standards, could save Indonesia tens of billions of dollars in capital costs over the next decade and a half."}{"Mushroom cultivation and biogas production: A sustainable reuse of organic resources ": "The industry of mushroom cultivation uses a wide variety of lignocellulosic waste and is considered a very efficient way to recycle agro-residues and to produce food. This activity generates tons of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) every year, causing a significant disposal challenge. The SMS is a useful resource for the generation of biogas, since raw material is digested by the metabolism of fungi, performing as a pre-treatment, thus facilitating the subsequent anaerobic digestion and increasing the yield of methane production. Forty-one species of fungi have been used as pre-treatment in different types of residues; among them, 13 were cultivated mushrooms. The potential production of methane using SMS pre-treated with cultivated mushrooms should be added to the list of other common residues used, such as food/vegetable waste and pig manure. Biogas can be used as fuel, and the residues from biogas can be used as fertilizers for food crops. These productive activities can be integrated in a virtuous circle of reuse of organic resources; in which the waste of one activity is used as a substrate for another activity. Given the huge amount of SMS produced, we propose to integrate it into a virtuous circle of resource reutilization for energy generation, particularly as a viable substrate for biogas generation."}{"Between the tides: Modelling the elevation of Australia's exposed intertidal zone at continental scale ": "The intertidal zone represents a critical transition between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, supporting a complex mosaic of highly productive and biologically diverse habitats. However, our understanding of these important coastal environments is limited by a lack of spatially consistent topographic data, which can be extremely challenging and costly to obtain at continental-scale. Satellite remote sensing represents an important resource for monitoring extensive coastal zones. Previous approaches to modelling the elevation of the intertidal zone using earth observation (EO) data have been restricted to small study regions or have relied on manual image interpretation, thus limiting their ability to be applied consistently over large geographic extents. In this study, we present an automated open-source approach to generate satellite-derived elevation data for over 15,387\u202fkm2 of intertidal terrain across the entire Australian coastline. Our approach combines global tidal modelling with a 30-year time series archive of spatially and spectrally calibrated Landsat satellite data managed within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform. The resulting National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model (NIDEM) dataset provides an unprecedented three-dimensional representation of Australia's vast exposed intertidal zone at 25\u202fm spatial resolution. We validate our model against LiDAR, RTK GPS and multibeam bathymetry datasets, finding that modelled elevations are highly accurate across sandy beach (\u00b10.41\u202fm RMSE) and tidal flat environments (\u00b10.39\u202fm RMSE). Model performance was least accurate (\u00b12.98\u202fm RMSE) within rocky shores and reefs and other complex coastal environments with extreme and variable tidal regimes. We discuss key challenges associated with modelling intertidal elevation including tidal model performance and biased observations from sun-synchronous satellites, and suggest future directions to improve the accuracy and utility of continental-scale intertidal elevation modelling. Our model can be applied to tidally-influenced coastal environments globally, addressing a key gap between the availability of sub-tidal bathymetry and terrestrial elevation data."}{"Microplastic pollution in commercial salt for human consumption: A review ": "Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles with less than 5\u202fmm in size that are considered global environmental pollutants. The MPs present in the environment result from the successive breakdown of larger plastic pieces or from the direct input of micro- and nano-sized particles used in various industries and products available to consumers. Such MPs have been found in several wild species and other natural resources, including some consumed as food by humans, with possible adverse effects on ecosystem and human health. The central aim of this work was to review the published literature regarding the contamination of sea commercial salts (sea and terrestrial origins) and its possible impacts on human health. Moreover, to lead to a comprehensive understanding of the paradigm, a short introduction and revision of the environmental contamination by MPs and its effects are included. MPs have been found in commercial salts from 128 brands, from 38 different countries spanning over five continents. The concentration of MPs found in the samples analysed is lower than the concentrations of MPs reported in other resources, such as blue mussels. However, as commercial salts are used every day and by all humans, they constitute a long-term exposure route for the general population in addition to others (e.g., animals consumed as food by humans, water, air). Therefore, commercial salts contaminated with MPs may contribute to the potential long-term adverse effects resulting from human exposure to these particles."}{"Behavioral adaptations of sandy beach macrofauna in face of climate change impacts: A conceptual framework ": "Sandy beaches are severely under-represented in the literature on climate-change ecology, yet different lines of evidence suggest that the macrofauna inhabiting these narrow and dynamic environments located at the land-sea interface is being reorganized under the influence of this large scale and long-lasting stressor. This is reflected in macrofaunal sensitivity to increasing sea surface temperature, sea-level rise, extreme events and erosion of the narrow physical habitat. However, evidence of behavioral responses by sandy beach macrofauna that are consistent with expectations under climate change is scarce and fragmentary. In this paper, specific hypotheses are formulated for how behavioral adaptations in sandy beach macrofauna are predicted to respond to climate change impacts. Firstly, a conceptual framework and an overview of macrofauna behavioral adaptation features are provided. Secondly, the effects of main climate change drivers on sandy beaches are summarized. Thirdly, a conceptual framework is developed giving behavioral adaptations of sandy beach macrofauna under climate change pressure. The degree to which observations on behavioral adaptations of beach animals conform to expectations under specific climate change drivers (sea level rise, sea surface temperature, winds and storminess, rainfall, acidification and eutrophication) is explored. Taking into account the empirical evidence and the theoretical framework detailed in the paper, emergent hypotheses/predictions are proposed. Climate change drivers are expected to impact habitat features and consequently the behavioral expression of macrofauna as active responses to habitat changes. Behavioral adaptations are expected to be impaired, more variable or disrupted, thus decreasing fitness, causing local population extirpations and potentially triggering a range of cascading effects of ecological change in the beach ecosystem. Biodiversity loss will be the outcome of the negative pressures driven by climate change. The specificity of sandy beaches as narrow ecotones between sea and land may be lost under climate change pressure, adversely affecting fine-tuned macrofaunal adaptations and therefore ecosystem functioning. Strictly adapted endemic sandy beach fauna will be especially subjected to local extirpations, while species with a large reaction norm (i.e. phenotypic and behavioral plasticity) may face changes by dispersal and exploitation of new niches. Under climate change impacts, biodiversity loss is predicted, which would hamper beach ecosystem resilience. The limits to which sandy beach macrofauna responds and can behaviorally adapt to environmental change are worthy of exploration, in view of the increasing influence of the long-lasting climate driven stressors threatening these ecosystems at risk."}{"Recommended priorities for research on ecological impacts of ocean and coastal acidification in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic ": "The estuaries and continental shelf system of the United States Mid-Atlantic are subject to ocean acidification driven by atmospheric CO2, and coastal acidification caused by nearshore and land-sea interactions that include biological, chemical, and physical processes. These processes include freshwater and nutrient input from rivers and groundwater; tidally-driven outwelling of nutrients, inorganic carbon, alkalinity; high productivity and respiration; and hypoxia. Hence, these complex dynamic systems exhibit substantial daily, seasonal, and interannual variability that is not well captured by current acidification research on Mid-Atlantic organisms and ecosystems. We present recommendations for research priorities that target better understanding of the ecological impacts of acidification in the U. S. Mid-Atlantic region. Suggested priorities are: 1) Determining the impact of multiple stressors on our resource species as well as the magnitude of acidification; 2) Filling information gaps on major taxa and regionally important species in different life stages to improve understanding of their response to variable temporal scales and sources of acidification; 3) Improving experimental approaches to incorporate realistic environmental variability and gradients, include interactions with other environmental stressors, increase transferability to other systems or organisms, and evaluate community and ecosystem response; 4) Determining the capacity of important species to acclimate or adapt to changing ocean conditions; 5) Considering multi-disciplinary, ecosystem-level research that examines acidification impacts on biodiversity and biotic interactions; and 6) Connecting potential acidification-induced ecological impacts to ecosystem services and the economy. These recommendations, while developed for the Mid-Atlantic, can be applicable to other regions will help align research towards knowledge of potential larger-scale ecological and economic impacts."}{"Environmental drivers of benthic community structure in a deep sub-arctic fjord system ": "Fjords are unique geomorphological features that are found globally along (previously) glaciated coasts. They are characteristic for the entire Norwegian coast, where growing human populations and economic development increasingly impact the associated fjord ecosystems, and accordingly basic knowledge about ecosystem structure and functioning is needed. Knowledge about benthic systems within deep basins (over 400\u202fm) of sub-Arctic fjords is currently missing and it remains questionable whether our understanding of similarly deep temperate fjords or shallower sub-arctic fjords is directly transferable to such systems. This study aims to investigate the patterns of soft-bottom benthic communities within a northern Norwegian deep multibasin fjord system and relate them to the prevailing environmental conditions, following a sampling strategy of many-sites with one-sample each. Here we show that oxygen content of the water and organic matter gradients in the sediment, structure the benthic communities of the fjord reflecting the main basins. We found that the community of the deepest basin (>700\u202fm) of this sub-Arctic fjord is similar to the community just outside of Tysfjord at the same depth but differ from other communities within the fjord. Furthermore, the deep basin community reflects deep communities of temperate fjords and the deep Skagerrak. The community within the innermost basin is well adapted to periodic hypoxia with low quality or degraded food supply. Our results demonstrated that fjord specific multibasin topography and the corresponding environmental factors are important drivers of ecological processes, which resulted in distinct benthic communities in each of the three basins. The management of such heterogeneous fjord ecosystems should take an adaptive approach and apply measures that take the differences of these benthic communities into account."}{"Drivers and impacts of water level fluctuations in the Mississippi River delta: Implications for delta restoration ": "This review synthesizes the knowledge regarding the environmental forces affecting water level variability in the coastal waters of the Mississippi River delta and relates these fluctuations to planned river diversions. Water level fluctuations vary significantly across temporal and spatial scales, and are subject to influences from river flow, tides, vegetation, atmospheric forcing, climate change, and anthropogenic activities. Human impacts have strongly affected water level variability in the Mississippi River delta and other deltas worldwide. Collectively, the research reviewed in this article is important for enhancing environmental, economic, and social resilience and sustainability by assessing, mitigating, and adapting to geophysical changes that will cascade to societal systems in the coming decades in the economically and environmentally important Mississippi River delta. Specifically, this information provides a context within which to evaluate the impacts of diversions on the hydrology of the Mississippi delta and creates a benchmark for the evaluation of the impact of water level fluctuations on coastal restoration projects worldwide."}{"Scientific considerations for acidification monitoring in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Region ": "Coastal and ocean acidification has the potential to cause significant environmental and societal impacts. Monitoring carbonate chemistry parameters over spatial and temporal scales is challenging, especially with limited resources. A lack of monitoring data can lead to a limited understanding of real-world conditions. Without such data, robust experimental and model design is challenging, and the identification and understanding of episodic acidification events is nearly impossible. We present considerations for resource managers, academia, and industry professionals who are currently developing acidification monitoring programs in the Mid-Atlantic region. We highlight the following considerations for deliberation: 1) leverage existing infrastructure to include multiple carbonate chemistry parameters as well as other water quality measurements, 2) direct monitoring efforts in subsurface waters rather than limiting monitoring to surface waters, 3) identify the best available sensor technology for long-term, in-situ monitoring, 4) monitor across a salinity gradient to account for the complexity of estuarine, coastal, and ocean environments, and identify potential areas of enhanced vulnerability, 5) increase sampling frequency to capture variability, 6) consider other drivers (e.g., freshwater discharge, nutrients, physiochemical parameters) that may affect acidification, and 7) conduct or continue monitoring in specific ecological and general regions that may have enhanced vulnerability. Through the incorporation of these considerations, individual monitoring programs can more efficiently and effectively leverage resources and build partnerships for a more comprehensive data collection in the region. While these considerations focus on the Mid-Atlantic region), similar strategies can be used to leverage resources in other locations."}{"A systematic survey of bar-built estuaries along the California coast ": "Of California's 577 coastal confluences, 278 of these are characterized as bar-built estuaries or coastal river mouth lagoons. Development during the 20th century has led to varying and often extreme levels of alteration to these estuarine systems. Changes to the natural timing and magnitude of riverine flows and modification of the mouth have affected the frequency and depth of marsh plain flooding, as well as the timing of breaching events. This project used standard assessment techniques to document and quantify the current environmental condition of 32\u202fbar-built estuaries of various sizes, distributed throughout California. Estuary lagoon filling/flushing patterns (documented using pressure/temperature loggers) were found to fluctuate most in spring (due to bar closure with continued fluvial discharge) and late fall (due to high wave overtopping events). These spring and fall water level increases led to marsh plain flooding. Marshes were flooded for periods ranging from 9 to 65 days. Sites that supported long summer ponding periods increased hydraulic connectivity with side channels and back water environments and were characterized as having optimal habitat condition using the California Rapid Assessment Method. Bar-built estuaries with lower condition were found to have higher abundance of agriculture and impervious surface within their watersheds. The lowest condition sites had more than 65% impervious surface within the 2\u202fkm radius around the bar-built estuary. Also, bar-built estuary systems where bar management occurred (periodic or permanent) were found to have a lower habitat condition and support fewer native plant species. Summer salinity exceeded 25 within portions of thirteen of the 32 estuaries and all but three systems had water within portions of the main channel with salinity below 5. Our findings suggest that water elevations, dissolved oxygen concentrations, salinity and temperature vary widely within bar-built estuaries and thus, management decisions should account for this variability to ensure support for a diversity of endemic species."}{"Lagrangian observations of estuarine residence times, dispersion, and trapping in the Salish Sea ": "Estuaries are important mediators in the transport of freshwater, sediment, and dissolved material into the ocean, and many studies have investigated mean estuarine circulation. However, it is not clear how descriptions of the mean circulation are linked to the motion of individual water parcels, or of discrete items floating within the system, nor how they related to the variability in this dispersal. An obvious approach to characterizing this variability is to actually measure dispersal by tracking Lagrangian drifters. Recent technological advances have dramatically decreased the cost of satellite-tracked and monitored drifters, making longer deployments of large numbers of expendable drifters much more feasible. Here we take advantage of this opportunity to directly characterize the seaward flow and dispersion of surface water in a relatively well-studied estuarine system (the Salish Sea on the NE Pacific coast), combining 2200 drifter-days of data from more than 400 tracked drifters with the deployment of nearly 6000 traditional driftcards. Residence times in different parts of the system estimated from the drifter observations are similar but systematically lower than those derived from other methods, and we speculate that this may be because surface drifts are faster than layer-mean drifts in a fjord-type estuarine system. We also find that drifters tend to ground on shore, and that time to-grounding from different source locations has an approximately exponential distribution with a mean of only a few days, much less than the transport time to the ocean. The estuary is therefore a highly efficient trap for floating objects. Finally, we quantify a dispersion coefficient, finding that dispersion is a critical component of transport in parts of the Salish Sea, often much more important than mean advection. The mean is visible only after averaging for weeks or months."}{"Tidal wave propagation along The Mekong deltaic coast ": "A two-dimensional, barotropic numerical model was employed to investigate the dynamics of tidal wave propagation in the South China Sea with a particular interest for its characteristics along the Mekong deltaic coast. The study indicates that tidal waves propagate from the Pacific Ocean into the South China Sea mainly through the Luzon Strait (LS), where the K1 diurnal tide dominates due to a quarter wavelength resonance in this semi-enclosed basin, and that the incoming tidal waves from the Celebes open boundary play a more important role than those from the Andaman and Flores open boundaries. Previous studies have not explained why both adjacent seas including the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand are dominated by a diurnal tide, while a semidiurnal tide dominates along the eastern Mekong deltaic coast. By means of Green's law, continental shelf tidal resonance theory and standing wave theory, this study clarifies that the large amplified M2 semidiurnal amplitude leading to a prevailing mixed semidiurnal tide is caused not only by the shoaling effect and the continental shelf oscillation resonance phenomenon but also by the position on the standing wave anti-node line. Moreover, the finding of radial tidal currents occurring along the southern Mekong estuarine coast has not been revealed in earlier studies. Based on a number of numerical, geometrically schematised experiments, we suggest that the interaction between the large amplified amplitude near the shoreline associated with the adjacent low amplitude band system, causing convex hydraulic gradients of tidal amplitude due to basin geometry as well as sloping topography, is the mechanism for developing these radial tidal current systems. The results reveal that wind monsoon climate could cause either damped or amplified tidal amplitudes around the Mekong deltaic coast of which approximately 2\u20133\u202fcm is due to the changing atmospheric pressure, the tangential stress of wind over the water surface and wind enhanced bottom friction. Also, this study suggests that the tidal generating forces should be considered to achieve accurate model results depending on the geographical region of interest. Findings achieved from this study contribute to a deeper insight of tidal wave propagation from a deep ocean to a shallow flat basin similar to the South China Sea and its Mekong deltaic coast."}{"Retrieval of nearshore bathymetry from Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites in South Florida coastal waters ": "This study examines the relatively high-resolution MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2A and 2B for generating bathymetric maps through a ratio transform model in South Florida (United States). Atmospheric correction of imagery is implemented though ACOLITE software, providing accurate performance and consistency over different Sentinel-2A/B scenes and three different study sites. Vertical calibration uses 5\u201310 points collected from digital charts, independent of lidar surveys, which are used for validation and error analysis. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has Median Absolute Error (MedAE) of 0.5\u202fm in West Palm Beach (at depths ranging between 0 and 18\u202fm, limit of lidar survey for validation), 0.4\u202fm in Key West (0\u20135\u202fm), and 0.22\u202fm in Dry Tortugas (0\u20136\u202fm), in conditions with low turbidity. Accurate bathymetry mapping can be accomplished with both sensors over environments with varying water transparency conditions, with the advantage of a fast, flexible, and economical solution. The 10-m MSI can capture small-scale features, such as tidal channels, straits relevant to navigation or steep slopes. While the least error is achieved by calibrating each image separately, a generic calibration produces only a moderately greater error with MedAE still \u223c1m, indicating the robustness of the approach. The research highlights the great potential of the 5-day revisit, suggesting that the twin Sentinel-2 mission of the Copernicus programme may enhance SDB to leverage its use for several operational purposes, particularly in remote and inaccessible regions of the world."}{"A review of sediment diversion in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain ": "One of the proposed methods for restoring the disappearing Mississippi Delta is sediment diversion which uses channels and structures to divert water and sediment from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers into adjacent basins. This study presents a comprehensive review of geological and physical aspects of sediment dynamics in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain (MRDP), with special reference to diversion studies over the past two decades. We synthesize these studies, present the current understanding of sediment diversions in the context of sediment dynamics, identify multiple key knowledge gaps, and make recommendations for future studies.\n                  To maximize net land building in the MRDP, management strategies should be focused on (a) enhancing river sediment delivery (both mud and sand), (b) increasing sediment retention in receiving basins and (c) minimizing erosion in bays and estuaries. Compared with extensive studies of land building, there have been relatively fewer studies of erosional processes. A heterogeneous coastal geological framework, cohesive sediment erodibility and subsidence together play complicated yet critical roles in future sediment dynamics in bays and estuaries of the MRDP. Sediment retention rates are highly sensitive to spatial and temporal scales, types of sediments and delivery season. Sediment diversions to seaward receiving basins provide more surge protection but tend to have lower sediment retention due to active coastal processes. Structures and devices that improve sediment retention, trap sediments, dissipate waves, and build living shorelines should be explored and cost-to-benefit analysis is needed. Long-term planning should consider more landward diversions, strategic community relocation, and nonlinear response of the complex sedimentary system of the MRDP."}{"International Commission on Trichinellosis: Recommendations for quality assurance in digestion testing programs for Trichinella\n             ": "Effective performance of digestion testing methods for Trichinella, and their use for the detection of infected animals and the prevention of human trichinellosis require system-wide incorporation of appropriate quality assurance (QA) practices. The recommendations of the International Commission on Trichinellosis (ICT) aim to facilitate reliable test results when laboratories operate within a quality management system (QMS) which includes: 1) a quality manual (or similar documentation of the QMS); 2) a validated test method with identified critical control points; 3) a training program; 4) procedures utilizing proficiency testing and other methods to confirm technical capability of analysts; 5) equipment calibration and maintenance; 6) standard operating procedures, related documentation and reporting; 7) procedures to enable continuous monitoring and improvements; and 8) regular internal and third party audits. The quality manual or similar documentation describes the QMS within a testing laboratory, and lists the QA policies and good laboratory practices. Quality assurance goals contained in such documentation are the foundation of an effective QA program and must be explicit, measurable, and expressed in terms of performance criteria for the test method based on purpose for testing. The digestion method is capable of consistently detecting Trichinella larvae in meat at a level of sensitivity that is recognized to be effective for use in controlling animal infection and preventing human disease. However, consistent performance of the assay is assured only when parameters of the test method have been defined, scientifically validated as fit for purpose, and used within an effective QMS. The essential components of a digestion assay, specifically the critical control points and minimum standards for test performance are described. Reliable proficiency samples and their appropriate use in a quality system are key factors for certifying and maintaining an effective testing laboratory, including qualifying, re-qualifying and disqualifying of analysts as appropriate. Thus recommendations are included for the preparation and use of proficiency samples in a Trichinella digestion testing laboratory. The minimum training requirements for analysts performing a quality assured digestion assay, as well as suggested requirements for the content of a training manual, are also outlined. Finally, these ICT recommendations include essential components and minimum standards for maintaining and achieving certification and maintenance of a laboratory performing digestion testing for Trichinella. The certification program for the laboratory, including qualifying analysts, may be administered by a National Reference Laboratory or an authorized third party certifying body, under the auspices of the appropriate competent authority."}{"Environmental transmission of Toxoplasma gondii: Oocysts in water, soil and food ": "Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite that can cause morbidity and mortality in humans, domestic animals, and terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. The environmentally robust oocyst stage of T. gondii is fundamentally critical to the parasite's success, both in terms of its worldwide distribution as well as the extensive range of infected intermediate hosts. Despite the limited definitive host species (domestic and wild felids), infections have been reported on every continent, and in terrestrial as well as aquatic environments. The remarkable resistance of the oocyst wall enables dissemination of T. gondii through watersheds and ecosystems, and long-term persistence in diverse foods such as shellfish and fresh produce. Here, we review the key attributes of oocyst biophysical properties that confer their ability to disseminate and survive in the environment, as well as the epidemiological dynamics of oocyst sources including domestic and wild felids. This manuscript further provides a comprehensive review of the pathways by which T. gondii oocysts can infect animals and people through the environment, including in contaminated foods, water or soil. We conclude by identifying critical control points for reducing risk of exposure to oocysts as well as opportunities for future synergies and new directions for research aimed at reducing the burden of oocyst-borne toxoplasmosis in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife."}{"Treatment of toxoplasmosis: Current options and future perspectives ": "Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide parasitic disease infecting about one third of humans, with possible severe outcomes in neonates and immunocompromised patients. Despite continuous and successful efforts to improve diagnosis, therapeutic schemes have barely evolved since many years. This article aims at reviewing the main clinical trials and current treatment practices, and at addressing future perspectives in the light of ongoing researches."}{"\n               Toxoplasma gondii infection and toxoplasmosis in farm animals: Risk factors and economic impact ": "The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic parasite that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Felids, including domestic cats, are definitive hosts that can shed oocysts with their feces. In addition to infections that occur by accidental oral uptake of food or water contaminated with oocysts, it is assumed that a large proportion of affected humans may have become infected by consuming meat or other animal products that contained infective parasitic stages of T. gondii. Since farm animals represent a direct source of infection for humans, but also a possible reservoir for the parasite, it is important to control T. gondii infections in livestock. Moreover, T. gondii may also be pathogenic to livestock where it could be responsible for considerable economic losses in some regions and particular farming systems, e.g. in areas where the small ruminant industry is relevant.\n                  This review aims to summarize actual knowledge on the prevalence and effects of infections with T. gondii in the most important livestock species and on the effects of toxoplasmosis on livestock. It also provides an overview on potential risk factors favoring infections of livestock with T. gondii. Knowledge on potential risk factors is prerequisite to implement effective biosecurity measures on farms to prevent T. gondii infections. Risk factors identified by many studies are cat-related, but also those associated with a potential contamination of fodder or water, and with access to a potentially contaminated environment. Published information on the costs T. gondii infections cause in livestock production, is scarce. The most recent peer reviewed reports from Great Britain and Uruguay suggest annual cost of about 5\u201315 million US $ per country. Since these estimates are outdated, future studies are needed to estimate the present costs due to toxoplasmosis in livestock. Further, the fact that T. gondii infections in livestock may affect human health needs to be considered and the respective costs should also be estimated, but this is beyond the scope of this article."}{"Toxoplasmosis: Overview from a One Health perspective ": "Toxoplasmosis is paradigmatic of the One Health approach, as the causative parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans. This makes T. gondii one of the most successful parasites on earth, infecting up to a third of the global human population. Moreover, the T. gondii disease burden has been ranked among the highest of all parasitic diseases. To reduce the disease burden of toxoplasmosis in humans, interventions are needed in the animal reservoirs, necessitating close collaboration between both the human and veterinary medical sectors. In the present special issue of FAWPAR, several of the most pertinent topics related to the impact and control of toxoplasmosis are addressed by leading experts in the field. This collection of papers highlights state-of-the-art knowledge, gaps in knowledge and future perspectives, as well as the benefits of current and proposed future activities to tackle toxoplasmosis within the One Health context."}{"A one health approach to vaccines against Toxoplasma gondii\n             ": "Summary\n               \n                  Toxoplasmosis is a serious disease with global impact, now recognised as one of the most important food borne diseases worldwide and a major cause of production loss in livestock. A one health approach to develop a vaccination programme to tackle toxoplasmosis is an attractive and realistic prospect. Knowledge of disease epidemiology, parasite transmission routes and main risk groups has helped to target key host species and outcomes for a vaccine programme and these would be to prevent/reduce congenital disease in women and sheep; prevent/reduce T. gondii tissue cysts in food animal species and to prevent/reduce T. gondii oocyst shedding in cats. Most animals, including humans, develop good protective immunity following infection, involving cell mediated immune responses, which may explain why live vaccines are generally more effective to protect against T. gondii. Recent advances in our knowledge of parasite genetics and gene manipulation, strain variation, key antigenic epitopes, delivery systems and induction of immune responses are all contributing to the prospects of developing new vaccines which may be more widely applicable. A key area in progressing vaccine development is to devise standard vaccine efficacy models in relevant animal hosts and this is where a one health approach bringing together researchers across different disciplines can be of major benefit. The tools and technologies are in place to make a real impact in tackling toxoplasmosis using vaccination and it just requires a collective will to make it happen."}{"Diversity of Toxoplasma gondii strains at the global level and its determinants ": "The population structure of Toxoplasma gondii is characterized by contrasting geographic patterns of strain diversity at different spatial scales: global, regional and even local scales in some regions. The determinants of this diversity pattern and its possible evolutionary mechanisms are still largely unexplored. This review will focus on three main dichotomies observed in the population structure of the parasite: (1) domestic versus wild, (2) South America versus the rest of the world and (3) intercontinental clonal lineages versus regional or local clonal lineages. Here, the impact in terms of public health of this remarkably contrasting geographic diversity of T. gondii populations is discussed, with emphasis on the role of globalization of exchanges that could lead to rapid evolution of T. gondii population spatial structure and new challenges in a One Health context."}{"Prevention and mitigation of congenital toxoplasmosis. Economic costs and benefits in diverse settings ": "Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT), the result of a primary infection of pregnant women with Toxoplasma gondii which was transmitted to the fetus, may result in mild to deep injuries occurring in the newborn or later in its development or in adolescence. The visual and cognitive impairment that can result imposes substantial economic costs on the individual and society. Numerous observational studies favor the conclusion that, with preventive measures currently available, it is possible to reduce the incidence of infections in pregnant women, the incidence of fetal infection by preventing transplacental transmission, and the gravity of injury in infected newborns. Treatment of infected newborns can also reduce the severity of consequences and the frequency of their occurrence later in life. Prevention programs, however, are applied in only a few countries; in most countries implementation of a national prevention program has not been considered or has been thought to be too expensive. This article lists the methods of prevention of CT and describes existing national prevention programs in France and Austria. It analyzes the economic costs and benefits of maternal screening for CT prevention and mitigation for society and for health systems. The economic feasibility of implementing national screening in low-prevalence, high-cost countries is illustrated with the example of the United States. New diagnostic tools are discussed and the implication of lower costs is considered, for countries with well-established screening programs as well as those with inadequate prenatal care networks."}{"The importance of being parasiticidal\u2026 an update on drug development for the treatment of alveolar echinococcosis ": "The lethal disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by the metacestode stage of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Current chemotherapeutical treatment of AE relies on albendazole and mebendazole, with the caveat that these compounds are not parasiticidal. Drugs have to be taken for a prolonged period of time, often life-long, which can cause adverse effects and reduces the patients' quality of life. In some individuals, benzimidazoles are inactive or cause toxicity, leading to treatment discontinuation. Alternatives to benzimidazoles are urgently needed. Over the recent years, in vivo and in vitro models for low-to-medium throughput drug discovery against AE have been set in place. In vitro drug tests include the phosphoglucose-isomerase (PGI) assay to measure physical damage induced to metacestodes, and viability assays to assess parasiticidal activity against metacestodes and stem cells. In vitro models are also employed for studies on mechanisms of action. In vivo models are thus far based on rodents, mainly mice, and benefits could be gained in future by comparative approaches in naturally infected dogs or captive monkeys.\n                  For the identification of novel drugs against AE, a rare disease with a low expected market return, drug-repurposing is the most promising strategy. A variety of chemically synthesized compounds as well as natural products have been analyzed with respect to in vitro and/or in vivo activities against AE. We here review and discuss the most active of these compounds including anti-infective compounds (benzimidazoles, nitazoxanide, amphotericin B, itraconazole, clarithromycin, DB1127, and buparvaquone), the anti-infective anti-malarials (artemisinin, ozonids, mefloquine, and MMV665807) and anti-cancer drugs (isoflavones, 2-methoxyestradiol, methotrexate, navelbine, vincristine, kinase inhibitors, metallo-organic ruthenium complexes, bortezomib, and taxanes). Taking into account the efficacy as well as the potential availability for patients, the most promising candidates are new formulations of benzimidazoles and mefloquine. Future drug-repurposing approaches should also target the energy metabolism of E. multilocularis, in particular the understudied malate dismutation pathway, as this offers an essential target in the parasite, which is not present in mammals."}{"A One Health systematic review of diagnostic tools for Echinococcus multilocularis surveillance: Towards equity in global detection ": "Echinococcus multilocularis is a zoonotic cestode of canid definitive hosts that is emerging as a parasite of medical and veterinary concern in regions of North America, Europe and Asia. Infection with the metacestode stage (alveolar echinococcosis \u2013 AE) is life-threatening, especially for patients who reside in low resource countries and lack access to modern diagnostic tests and treatments. The overall objectives of this One Health review were to systematically describe the diagnostic tests currently employed in endemic countries to detect E. multilocularis in people, canids and the environment, and to report the test characteristics of new diagnostic techniques for population surveillance. In this systematic review of English and Chinese language databases, we identified 92 primary records of E. multilocularis surveillance in canids (N\u202f=\u202f75), humans (N\u202f=\u202f20) and/or the environment (food, soil; N\u202f=\u202f3) and 12 grey literature records that reported E. multilocularis surveillance or health systems protocols between 2008 and 2018. Surveillance for E. multilocularis was conducted using a broad range of combined morphological, molecular, immunological and imaging techniques. Nine studies reporting diagnostic evaluations for cestode or metacestode detection were identified, including studies on copro-antigen ELISA, copro-PCR, intestinal examination, Western Blot, magnetic capture RT-PCR and immunochromatography. Our dataset includes prevalence estimates for E. multilocularis in canids, people, or environment in 27 of the 43 endemic countries and reports data gaps in surveillance, laboratory methods, and diagnostic sensitivity. International consensus on gold standard diagnostic techniques and harmonization of human, canid and environmental surveillance data across political boundaries are needed to comprehensively assess the global burden and distribution of this parasite."}{"First description of Giardia duodenalis in buffalo calves (Bubalus bubalis) in southwest region of S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil ": "We performed molecular characterization of Giardia duodenalis in buffalo calves from the Southwest region of S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. A total of 183 fecal samples of Murrah breed buffaloes up to six months of age were collected. We examined these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene and positive samples were characterized using additional PCR assays targeting a portion of the beta-giardin, the glutamate dehydrogenase and the triose-phosphate isomerase genes. Based on the SSU rRNA nPCR, the presence of G. duodenalis was confirmed in 12 (6.56%) of fecal samples, of these, five, four and three samples were positive for the tpi, bg and gdh genes, respectively. Assemblage identification by sequencing was successful in 6 of 12 samples and sequence analysis showed 100% genetic similarity with G. duodenalis assemblage E. This observation represents the first detection of G. duodenalis assemblage E in buffaloes calves in Brazil."}{"Low salt exposure results in inactivation of Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoites during formulation of dry cured ready-to-eat pork sausage ": "The production of safe and healthy food products represents one of the main objectives of the food industry. The presence of microorganisms in meat and products containing meat can result in a range of human health problems, as well as economic losses to producers of these products. However, contaminated meat products continue to initiate serious and large-scale outbreaks of disease in consumers. In addition to outbreaks of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, parasitic organisms, such as Toxoplasma gondii, are responsible for foodborne infections worldwide, and in the case of T. gondii, is considered the 2nd leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S. Transmission of Toxoplasma gondii has historically been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked meat products, including pork. Specific concerns with respect to pork products are ready-to-eat (RTE) pork meals. These are pork or products containing pork that are prepared by curing or drying, and are not intended to be cooked before being consumed.\n                  Previous studies have demonstrated that T. gondii is inactivated during dry cured sausage preparation, apparently in the batter during fermentation. In this study, we have analyzed timing of inactivation of T. gondii in freshly prepared pepperoni batter to confirm our previous findings, to determine how quickly inactivation occurs during fermentation, and to confirm what parameters of the sausage preparation are involved in inactivation of the parasite. Results from the current and previous study indicate that rapid inactivation of T. gondii bradyzoites occurs in low salt batter for dry cured sausage within 4\u202fh of initiation of fermentation."}{"Diagnostic and follow-up performance of serological tests for different forms/courses of alveolar echinococcosis ": "Diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is predominantly based on imaging procedures combined with immunodiagnostic testing. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the performance of four serological tests (EgHF-ELISA, Em2-ELISA, recEm18-ELISA and Em-Immunoblotting) for initial diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of AE patients. Overall, 101 AE patients were included, grouped according to treatment options and immune status as follows: (A) curative surgical treatment (n\u202f=\u202f45 patients), (B) non-radical or palliative surgical treatment (n\u202f=\u202f11), (C) benzimidazoles only (n\u202f=\u202f20), (D) immunocompromised with radical surgical treatment (n\u202f=\u202f11), (E) immunocompromised with benzimidazoles only (n\u202f=\u202f4), and finally a group of 10 AE patients (F) that were considered to present so-called \u201cabortive\u201d lesions. Initial (i.e. pretreatment) ELISA-based diagnosis for patients in groups A to E revealed overall diagnostic sensitivities of 95% for EgHF, 86% for Em2, and 80% for recEm18, respectively. Comparatively, the diagnostic sensitivity of Em-Immunoblotting was higher with an overall value of 98%. In group F, only Em-Immunoblotting had an excellent diagnostic sensitivity (100%), whereas the ELISAs had poor sensitivities of 30% (EgHF- and Em2-ELISA) or even 0% (recEm18-ELISA).\n                  Serological monitoring of AE patients showed a clear association between a curative development of disease (induced either by surgery or benzimidazole medication) and a negativization in the ELISAs. This effect was most pronounced for the recEm18-ELISA, where 56% negativized following diagnosis/treatment, as compared to 36% for the EgHF-ELISA, and 37% for the Em2-ELISA, respectively. After radical surgery, the mean time until negativization in the recEm18-ELISA was 2.4\u202fyears (SD 1.6). This was significantly shorter than the mean 3.9\u202fyears (SD 2.5) in those AE patients with non-radical, palliative surgery or ABZ treatment who were able to negativize during the study period (p\u202f=\u202f0.048).\n                  Conclusively, Em-Immunoblotting appears as the most sensitive test to diagnose active as well as inactive (\u201cabortive\u201d) AE-cases. The inclusion of the ELISAs completes the initial diagnostic picture and offers valuable additional information. Conversely, recEm18-ELISA appears as the currently best serological tool to monitor a regressive and putatively curative course of AE in treated patients."}{"Surgery versus conservative drug therapy in alveolar echinococcosis patients in Germany \u2013 A health-related quality of life comparison ": "Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a rare zoonosis caused by the parasite Echinococcus multilocularis. Nothing is known about the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with AE receiving different types of therapy. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare HRQoL in patients with AE in Germany depending on their therapeutic regimen namely conservative drug treatment with long-term benzimidazoles versus surgical therapy by resection of the parasitic liver lesions. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire, including other echinococcosis-related questions, was used to measure HRQoL. The SF-36 scales were evaluated according to the algorithms provided by the authors. The statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 9.2. The significance level was set at \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.05, p\u202f<\u202f0.05 corresponds to statistical significance. The investigated group consisted of conservatively drug treated (n\u202f=\u202f30) and patients with curative surgery (n\u202f=\u202f25) with confirmed AE. The study was performed at an infectious disease outpatient department from April 2018 to October 2018. The conservatively drug treated patient group consisted of 15 men (50.0%) and 15 women (50.0%) with an average age of 55.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f16.7\u202fyears (Median: 59). The surgery group consisted of nine men (36.0%) and 16 women (64.3%) with an average age of 53.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f31.9\u202fyears (Median: 54). The physical quality of life of the conservatively drug treated patients did not show any significant differences to the surgical treated group (45.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.4 vs. 47.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.9; p\u202f=\u202f0.4079). There was also no significant difference regarding the mental quality of life between the conservatively drug treated patients, and those treated with curative surgery (45.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.6 vs. 47.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.8; 0.5206). Nevertheless, there was a slight advantage in the physical and mental scores of the patients treated with surgery. Furthermore, for 13 of the 25 surgically treated patients, some aspects of the HRQoL improved significantly after surgery.\n                  The evaluation showed no statistically significant differences in HRQoL in patients with AE dependent on the applied treatment strategy (conservative drug versus curative surgical therapy)."}{"Comparison of tissues (heart vs. brain) and serological tests (MAT, ELISA and IFAT) for detection of Toxoplasma gondii in naturally infected wolverines (Gulo gulo) from the Yukon, Canada ": "Toxoplasmosis is an important parasitic zoonosis worldwide. Many human and animal surveys use serological assays based on Toxoplasma gondii antibody detection in serum, a matrix that is not routinely available from wildlife. Commonly used serological assays have rarely been validated for use with fluids other than serum, nor validated for their performance in wildlife species. New molecular assays, such as magnetic capture DNA extraction and real-time PCR (MC-qPCR), offer high sensitivity for detection of T. gondii DNA in tissues. The aims of this study were to (1) assess prevalence of T. gondii DNA based on MC-qPCR detection in brain and heart of naturally infected wolverines (Gulo gulo) from the Yukon, Canada (2) compare two matrices [heart fluid (collected from thawed heart) and filter eluate (eluted from blood soaked filter paper)] for antibody detection in the same species, and (3) evaluate the performance of three serological tests [modified agglutination test (MAT), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT)] to detect naturally infected wolverines as determined by MC-qPCR. DNA of T. gondii was detected in heart and/or brain in 16 of 68 wolverines (24%, 95% CI: 15.0\u201334.8). Tissue prevalence and infection intensity was higher in heart [16 positives, mediantachyzoites equivalents per gram (TEG) =1221] compared to brain (10 positives, median TEG\u202f=\u202f347). Heart fluid (HF) and filter eluates (FE) performed equally well in ELISA and IFAT in terms of relative sensitivity, but HF performed better with MAT. ELISA and IFAT had higher relative sensitivity (94%) and relative specificity (100%) compared to MAT (relative sensitivity 75% and relative specificity 92%). Overall, our findings indicate that the parasite burden in naturally infected wolverines was higher in heart compared to brain, heart fluid performed better than filter paper eluate for serological testing using MAT, and both IFAT and ELISA had higher relative sensitivity, relative specificity, and accuracy compared to MAT."}{"Inflow into Korea\u2019s Soyang Dam: Hydrologic variability and links to typhoon impacts ": "East Asia, including the Korean Peninsula, is exposed to the typhoon-related risk, especially in the form of flooding. The aim of this study was to determine the hydrologic variability characteristics of the Soyang River Dam\u2014a representative multipurpose dam in the Korean Han River basin\u2014with a particular focus on the quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of daily inflow into the dam basin and the related typhoon-impacts. Although the frequency of typhoons occurring in the western North Pacific Ocean region does not indicate any distinct increases, typhoons passing the domain of the Korean Peninsula change the summer flow of the Soyang River Dam significantly. Analysis results suggest that 22.6% of the summer flow in the Soyang River Dam can be attributed to typhoons. Furthermore, during the periods characterized by the transition from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a, typhoons exert a large influence on the hydrologic regime. The frequency of typhoon occurrence is highly correlated to the typhoon-induced flow, and the occurrence date of peak flows when typhoons strike was determined to be significantly delayed compared to that of the average years (1974\u20132015). In addition, low-flow metrics show downward trends, however, there is no distinct correlation with the statistical data of typhoons. The results from this study offer baseline information for mid- and long-term plans that cope with natural disasters or the supply of water resources for humans and natural systems according to the seasonal flow patterns of basins. The links to typhoons signify the critical importance of integrative analyses that consider hydrologic and meteorological phenomena."}{"Improving performance of a semi-analytical model for nonlinear water waves ": "An efficient semi-analytical solution to the problem of nonlinear water waves propagating at a constant depth is derived using parallel computing techniques. The approach is based on the assumptions of an irrotational flow of an inviscid and incompressible fluid. Velocity potential and free-surface displacement functions are represented in a form based on Fourier series satisfying a formulated initial boundary-value problem by a proper selection of time-dependent coefficients. The eigenfunction expansions are resolved by means of a Fast Fourier Transform technique and a higher-order time-stepping procedure to provide an efficient spectral collocation method of computation of wave-induced free-surface flows. The application of the Fourier transform qualifies the semi-analytical algorithm for efficient parallelization. Hence, the numerical model performance is improved using the computing capabilities of a GPU. The derived semi-analytical approach is easy to implement and may be straightforwardly extended to cover the generation of waves in a flume or a basin. The ability of the model to reproduce nonlinear phenomena is demonstrated in simulations of two- and three-dimensional instabilities of a modulated Stokes wave. The model can be used to solve standard as well as complex wave problems in large computational domains considerably faster than its CPU-based counterpart."}{"Optimization model for integrated river basin management with the hybrid WOAPSO algorithm ": "This work examines the effectiveness of a newly-developed optimization framework for river basin management. The proposed framework relies on the newly developed WOAPSO algorithm, which is a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm combining two conventional metaheuristic algorithms, namely the weed optimization algorithm (WOA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). Two case studies are presented in this study to evaluate the performance of the WOAPSO algorithm. The first case study consists of a ten-reservoir river basin example which compares the performance and reliability of the hybrid WOAPSO algorithm with that of linear programing (LP), non-linear programing (NLP), WOA, and the PSO algorithm. Results indicate the hybrid WOAPSO finds solutions meeting downstream water demands with 99.94% of reliability (with respect to the global optimum, as derived by LP) in the ten-reservoir system. It outperforms the WOA and PSO, which feature lower reliabilities than that achieved by WOAPSO. The second case study demonstrates failure of the conventional NLP optimization scheme in solving a real-world three-reservoir hydropower optimization problem which maximizes the efficiency index of hydropower production. The newly-introduced WOAPSO algorithm minimizes the objective function with superior efficiency compared with those of the WOA and PSO, in terms of the convergence rate and the achieved best values of the objective function. Furthermore, the WOAPSO is proven more reliable for solving complex multi-reservoir systems within the context of integrated river basin management than classic and evolutionary optimization algorithms."}{"Contribution of climatic variability and human activities to stream flow changes in the Haraz River basin, northern Iran ": "In northern Iran\u2019s Haraz River basin between 1975 and 2010, hydrological sensitivity, double mass curve, and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) methods were applied to monitoring and analysing changes in stream flow brought on by climatic variability and human activities. Applied to analyse trends in annual and seasonal runoff over this period, the sequential MK test showed a sudden change point in stream flow in 1994. The study period was, therefore, divided into two sub-periods: 1975\u20131994 and 1995\u20132010. The SWAT model showed obvious changes in water resource components between the two periods: in comparison to the period of 1975\u20131994, sub-watershed-scale stream flow and soil moisture decreased during 1995\u20132010. Changes in evapotranspiration were negligible compared to those in stream flow and soil moisture. The hydrological sensitivity method indicated that climatic variability and human activities contributed to 29.86% and 70.14%, respectively, of changes in annual stream flow, while the SWAT model placed these contributions at 34.78% and 65.21%, respectively. The double mass curve method indicated the contribution of climatic variability to stream flow changes to be 57.5% for the wet season and 22.87% for the dry season, while human activities contributed 42.5% and 77.13%, respectively. Accordingly, in the face of climatic variability, measures should be developed and implemented to mitigate its impacts and maintain eco-environmental integrity and water supplies."}{"Envelope curves for the specific discharge of extreme floods in Malaysia ": "The relationship between peak specific discharge and watershed area is examined for large, rare and extreme floods in Malaysia using a distributed hydrological model. Envelope curves for specific discharge for these events and the uncertainty is quantified. The relationships between rainfall duration and intensity as a function of watershed size were also examined. As a result, three main regions were defined to estimate the peak discharge as a function of watershed size for large, extreme and rare floods. The average magnitudes for the PMP and the world\u2019s extreme rainfall events were 5 and 12 times larger than the 100-year event, respectively. The envelope curves may assist engineers and other interested parties to estimate the peak discharge for watershed up to 100,000\u202fkm2, especially for ungauged watersheds."}{"Mechanistic insights into the origin of substituent-directed product Z\u2013E selectivity for gold-catalyzed [4+1]-annulations of 1,4-diyn-3-ols with isoxazoles: A DFT study ": "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to explore the Au(I)-catalyzed selective [4\u2009+\u20091] annulations of cyclopropyl- and H-substituted 1,4-diyn-3-ols with isoxazole. The results indicated that after the N-nucleophilic attack of isoxazole, instead of obtaining the \u03b1\u2013hydroxy gold carbene intermediate proposed experimentally, a concerted three-step forward product by isoxazole ON cleavage, 1,2-phenylalkyne shift and the hydroxyl H shift was identified as the key intermediate, for the reaction proceeding either via an Au-assisted CC double-bond rotation to produce the Z-isomeric enone or via two different Au-assisted CC rotations to furnish the E-configured enone depending on the substituents used. Further theoretical investigations indicated that the chemoselective step is the nucleophilic cyclization but not the CC double-bond rotation. The chemoselective preference for the Z-configured product using the cyclopropyl substitutent was attributed to two factors: i) the additional OHN hydrogen bonding interaction stabilizes the rate-determining cyclization TS leading to the Z-product, and ii) further Z-E product-isomerization is blocked due to significant structural deformation being involved. In contrast, using the H substituent results in a reversed chemoselectivity with exclusive formation of the E-configured enone, which is closely related to the smaller entropy effects involved."}{"Structural transformation of vanadate nanotubes into vanadate oxides nanostructures during the dry reforming of methane ": "The metal-containing vanadate nanotubes namely MeVO-NT (Me\u202f=\u202fNi, Co or Pt) were in situ transformed into vanadate oxides nanostructures i.e., MeVxOy, during the methane dry reforming. All the experimental observations through Raman, HRTEM, XRD, XPS, SEM-EDS, TG-FTIR and elemental analysis, strongly suggested that the VOx (MeV2O7, V2O5 and VO2) support contained the metal species that were involved in the dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction. The pristine VO-NT catalyst exhibited a fairly low activity in DRM due to its degradation. In the case of CoVO-NT, the Co3O4/VO2, Co3O4/Co2V2O7 and Co3O4/V2O5 phases were deactivated by oxidation of the Co particles, instead of being deactivated by sintering and coking, as well. In contrast to CoVO-NT, PtVO-NT having PtOx/V2O5, PtOx/VO2 or even PtOx/V2O7 phases inhibited heavy carbonaceous deposition on surface, but sintering was not avoided. The NiVO-NT was active due to the stability of the Ni\u00b0/Ni2V2O7 active phase in hindering heavy whisker and filamentous carbonaceous deposits on such catalyst. Using Halgren-Lipscomb algorithm in the frame of density functional theory (DFT), transition states energy for all three catalysts were obtained. It was found that PtVO-NT energy profile was lower than CoVO-NT and NiVO-NT counterparts. This suggested that the Pt sites dispersed on VOx structure was catalytic active during the methane activation in DRM whereas the CoVO-NT and CoVO-NT solids were prone to perform side reactions."}{"New NHC- silver and gold complexes active in A3-coupling (aldehyde-alkyne-amine) reaction ": "Silver and gold complexes bearing unsaturated N-heterocyclic carbene ligands, with unsymmetrical N-substituents and hydrogen or chlorine on backbone, have been synthetized and their efficiency tested in A3-coupling (aldehyde\u2013alkyne\u2013amine) reactions. Gold complexes showed higher activity than corresponding silver ones, even if the significant role of the backbone substituents should not be neglected. Indeed, complexes with chlorine substituted backbone were more efficient than hydrogen analogous. According to DFT calculations, electronic differences among complexes are able rationalize the different catalytic behavior, whereas steric properties play a minor part."}{"Industrial applications of immobilized enzymes\u2014A review ": "The use of immobilized enzymes is now a routine process for the manufacture of many industrial products in the pharmaceutical, chemical and food industry. Some enzymes, such as lipases, are naturally robust and efficient, can be used for the production of many different molecules and have a wide range of industrial applications thanks to their broad selectivity. As an example, lipase from Candida antarctica (CalB) has been used by BASF to produce chiral compounds, such as the herbicide Dimethenamide-P, which was previously made chemically. The use of the immobilized enzyme has provided significant advantages over a chemical process, such as the possibility to use equimolar concentration of substrates, obtain an enantiomeric excess > 99%, use relatively low temperatures (< 60\u202f\u00b0C) in organic solvent, obtain a single enantiomer instead of the racemate as in the chemical process and use a column configuration that allows dramatic increases in productivity. This process would not have been possible without the use of an immobilized enzyme, since it runs in organic solvent [1].\n                  Some more specific enzymes, like transaminases, have required protein engineering to become suitable for applications in production of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) in conditions which are extreme for a wild type enzyme. The process developed by Merck for sitagliptin manufacture is a good example of challenging enzyme engineering applied to API manufacture. The previous process of sitagliptin involved hydrogenation of enamine at high pressure using a rhodium-based chiral catalyst. By developing an engineered transaminase, the enzymatic process was able to convert 200\u202fg/l of prositagliptin in the final product, with e.e. >99.5% and using an immobilized enzyme in the presence of DMSO as a cosolvent [2].\n                  For all enzymes, the possibility to be immobilized and used in a heterogeneous form brings important industrial and environmental advantages, such as simplified downstream processing or continuous process operations. Here, we present a series of large-scale applications of immobilized enzymes with benefits for the food, chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetics and medical device industries, some of which have been scarcely reported on previously.\n                  In general, all enzymatic reactions can benefit from the immobilization, however, the final choice to use them in immobilized form depends on the economic evaluation of costs associated with their use versus benefits obtained in the process. It can be concluded that the benefits are rather significant, since the use of immobilized enzymes in industry is increasing."}{"Cellulose conversion to ethylene glycol by tungsten oxide-based catalysts ": "The conversion of cellulose into ethylene glycol remains a significant challenge in the biobased domain. Here we explored the activity of various bulk and mesoporous (doped) tungsten oxides in combination with carbon-supported ruthenium for obtaining ethylene glycol from cellulose. Tungstite and sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxides are more active and selective than monoclinic WO3. Doping tungstite with early transition metals enhanced the rate of cellulose depolymerization to glucose through a higher Br\u00f8nsted acidity, although this did not improve the overall performance as the higher acidity resulted in a higher rate of humin formation. The increased acidity of mesoporous sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxide compared to tungstite had a similar adverse effect. Doping this material with niobium improved ethylene glycol selectivity at similar conversion. Kinetic studies showed that the majority of ethylene glycol is produced in the first hour for three optimized catalysts, with undoped bulk tungstite being the most efficient catalytic material. Impregnation of these materials with ruthenium instead of using carbon-supported ruthenium as a co-catalyst was most beneficial for tungstite, as it showed improved ethylene glycol selectivity and lower polyol yields after 1\u2009h of reaction time."}{"Schiff base Cu(I) catalyst for aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols ": "We report here new copper(I)-Schiff base complexes for the selective oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes under ambient conditions (with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperdine-N-oxyl (TEMPO), N-methylimidazole (NMI), ambient air, acetonitril and RT). Particularly, the copper(I) complex bearing N-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(furan-2-yl)methanimine (L2) showed high activity in the series and gave near- quantitative yields in the oxidations of benzyl alcohol (99% yield in 1\u2009h) and 1-octanol (96% yield in 24\u2009h). Based on the X-ray structure determination, the complex has a square pyramidal coordination accomplished by two L2 ligands and bromide as a counter anion. The oxidation reactions were monitored with UV\u2013vis and in situ ATR-IR spectroscopy to study the changes in the catalytic structure and to elucidate the catalytic properties and the mechanistic details. Accordingly, detachment of one of the L2 ligands from the complexes is related to the oxidation activity."}{"Investigating the performance of internet of things based anaerobic digestion of food waste ": "A pilot scale decentralised Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) was designed, developed and installed, with 675\u202fL working volume, to treat food waste generated from the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) campus community. The reactor was operated in mesophilic, anaerobic and wet condition with feedstock as food waste of 10% Total Solids (TS) content. This study aims for performance evaluation of food waste anaerobic digestion and development of remote monitoring system suitable for centralised monitoring of decentralised anaerobic digestion plants. The performance of the reactor was remotely monitored with the installation of pH, Temperature and Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) electrodes connected with the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The quality of biogas produced was monitored by online biogas analyzer system. The CSTR was operated with three different Organic Loading Rates (OLR) viz., 1, 2 and 3\u202fkg of volatile solids per cubic meter of digester per day (kg VS/m3.d) to evaluate performance of the food waste digestion and biogas production. The average biogas yield was 0.75, 0.62 and 0.52 cubic meter per kilogram of volatile solids (m3/kg VS), with average methane yield of 0.42, 0.33 and 0.27\u202fm3/kg VS at OLR of 1, 2 and 3\u202fkg VS/m3.d respectively. Furthermore, it was observed that the average reduction in total solids was 70.7, 66.5 and 54.98% and average reduction in volatile solids was 78.3, 72 and 67% at OLR of 1, 2 and 3\u202fkg VS/m3.d respectively. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled remote monitoring on real time basis and aided the centralised operator to improve the process performance resulting in better operation and maintenance of the decentralised anaerobic digestion systems."}{"A review on approaches for addressing the limitations of Fenton oxidation for recalcitrant wastewater treatment ": "Fenton oxidation is an effective technology for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants. However, conventional Fenton oxidation possesses some drawbacks such as the requirement of acidic pH condition, production of iron sludge and requirement of high chemical inputs. Strategies such as heterogeneous Fenton, fluidized bed Fenton, use of chelating agents and in-situ production of Fenton\u2019s reagent have been studied as possible solutions to these limitations. Although there have been reviews on the fundamentals and applications of Fenton oxidation, a review with focus on the limitations of Fenton oxidation and their possible solutions is lacking. Here, we review the limitations of Fenton oxidation and the recent strategies toward addressing them. For each approach, fundamentals and applications in the removal of recalcitrant pollutants are reviewed. Heterogeneous Fenton process is the most widely investigated due to the progress in catalysis. Fluidized bed Fenton process could lower sludge generation and enhance process performance. Chelating agents are used to conduct homogeneous Fenton at circumneutral pH, though the potential detrimental effect of some chelating agents remains a source of concern. In situ production of Fenton\u2019s reagent through bioelectrochemical technology (bioelectro-Fenton) is emerging as a possible strategy to reduce the cost associated with Fenton\u2019s reagent."}{"Promising prospects of nanomaterials for arsenic water remediation: A comprehensive review ": "This review discusses the brief of health problem associated with the arsenic exposure found in drinking water. This review also discusses the shortcomings associated with the traditional methods, advantages with adsorption process and the new approaches towards the advance and effective techniques. The novelty of present study is a collection of latest literature and reports which comprises the latest advances made in the nanoparticles and nano-composites for the efficient removal of arsenic from aqueous medium. The mechanism of interaction of arsenic and nanomaterials surface is discussed in this novel review. The latest and novel approaches towards avoiding the preoxidation step for arsenite removal using oxidants is also highlighted, and the large numbers of nanomaterials having the photo catalytic properties and functionalities for simultaneous oxidation of arsenite to arsenate and adsorption of both forms, is also deliberated.

Phase change materials (PCMs), due to their unique thermo-physical properties, have been exploited in different designs of solar collectors to maximize the useful heat gained by collectors. Moreover, adding nanoparticles to PCMs to produce nanocomposite (NC) PCMs with superior thermo-physical properties added new advantages to the applications of these materials in solar collector applications. This literature review focuses on the different developments of these materials and their implementation with flat plate solar water collectors. Furthermore, the effect of adding different types of nanoparticles, including: metal, metal oxides, carbon nanoparticles, a high thermal conductivity skeleton graphite, and metal foams, on the heat transfer behavior and thermal conductivity of PCMs are also reviewed and analyzed. The reviewed results indicated that a significant improvement in the thermal conductivity of PCMs has been obtained using carbon-based nanoparticles, specifically graphite and graphene nano-platelets compared to metal and metal oxides nanoparticles at different nanoparticle concentrations. It is also revealed that, the integration of the PCMs in FPSWCs leads to a satisfactory storage capacity and could provide hot water temperature for a longer time. Moreover, it is recommended that the use of NCPCMs may be considered as an effective tool to improve the efficiency of the FPSWC. However, further optimization studies are needed to explore the impact of different factors such as nanoparticle type, nanoparticle weight fraction, nanoparticle size, and PCM type on the collector performance. A noteworthy observations, important proportionalities, and future trends are also discussed."}{"An intelligent fire detection approach through cameras based on computer vision methods ": "Fire that is one of the most serious accidents in petroleum and chemical factories, may lead to considerable production losses, equipment damages and casualties. Traditional fire detection was done by operators through video cameras in petroleum and chemical facilities. However, it is an unrealistic job for the operator in a large chemical facility to find out the fire in time because there may be hundreds of video cameras installed and the operator may have multiple tasks during his/her shift. With the rapid development of computer vision, intelligent fire detection has received extensive attention from academia and industry. In this paper, we present a novel intelligent fire detection approach through video cameras for preventing fire hazards from going out of control in chemical factories and other high-fire-risk industries. The approach includes three steps: motion detection, fire detection and region classification. At first, moving objects are detected through cameras by a background subtraction method. Then the frame with moving objects is determined by a fire detection model which can output fire regions and their locations. Since false fire regions (some objects similar with fire) may be generated, a region classification model is used to identify whether it is a fire region or not. Once fire appears in any camera, the approach can detect it and output the coordinates of the fire region. Simultaneously, instant messages will be immediately sent to safety supervisors as a fire alarm. The approach can meet the needs of real-time fire detection on the precision and the speed. Its industrial deployment will help detect fire at the very early stage, facilitate the emergency management and therefore significantly contribute to loss prevention."}{"Modeling and optimization of heterogeneous Fenton-like and photo-Fenton processes using reusable Fe3O4-MWCNTs ": "In this work, iron (II, III) oxide (Fe3O4) was synthesized and incorporated onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to prepare Fe3O4-MWCNTs composite in a quest for evaluating its performance and reusability in both Fenton-like and photo-Fenton processes. The characterization of Fe3O4-MWCNTs by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy showed that the prepared catalyst can behave as a composite. Methylene blue (MB) was used as a substrate for evaluation of Fenton-like and photo-Fenton processes. The reusability of the catalyst and the influence of operation parameters such as pH, H2O2 dosage, and catalyst loading were investigated. Complete degradation of MB was attained by Fe3O4-MWCNTs in the aforementioned processes, whereas the removal efficiency of MB by using bare MWCNTs under the same conditions was 52%, which suggests that the generated oxidant species due to the reactions between H2O2 and leached iron contribute to the degradation of MB. A degradation pathway was proposed based on the oxidation intermediates that have been detected by mass spectrometry. The reusability of Fe3O4-MWCNTs has been examined in four consecutive cycles. The final removal of MB in the fourth cycle was 94%. The optimization of MB removal was investigated by response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD). Moreover, an artificial neural network (ANN) of type feed-forward back propagation was employed to model the influence of operating conditions. The ANN model revealed a high correlation in the prediction of the removal efficiency (R2\n                     =0.9934)."}{"Grass-modified graphene aerogel for effective oil-water separation ": "Grass-modified graphene aerogel (GGA) was successfully fabricated via simple, low-cost and environment-friendly hydrothermal treatment. The samples exhibited porous structure, low density of 6.99mg/cm3, good thermostability, excellent hydrophobicity with water contact angle of 146\u00b0. The properties of graphene aerogel have been significantly improved by introducing grass powder, leading to highly efficient selective adsorption. The adsorption capacity of GGA ranged from 68.40 to 145.84g/g for various liquid solvents, which is superior to that of unmodified graphene aerogel (GA). Moreover, GGA can be regenerated by repeated heat treatment and its adsorption capacity maintaining at above 90% of initial value after regeneration. GGA can realize oil-water separation of mixed solution by different manipulation methods. On one hand, GGA removed little oils in water through adsorption. On the other hand, GGA can act as filter media dealing with oil-water mixtures and collecting oils continuously by gravity or peristaltic pump. Good selectivity, high adsorption capacities and satisfactory recoverability make it possible to become a potential candidate in the field of oil-water separation and spill oil cleanup to realize environmental remediation. In the meantime, the incorporation of grass improves the performances of graphene aerogel in hydrophobicity, mechanical property and oil adsorption efficiency, providing a new path for high-value utilization of biomass waste."}{"A bibliometric review of process safety and risk analysis ": "Process safety and risk analysis have paramount significance in the modern process industries for preventing fatalities and asset and reputation loss due to an accident. Hence, this has been an active area of research for many decades around the world.

It is crucial to develop a quick response strategy, including the accurate prediction of oil and gas migration path, oil droplet size distribution and other parameters. Volume of fluid (VOF) model and realizable k-\u03b5 turbulence model are employed to investigate the underwater spreading characteristics and migration law of oil leakage. Influencing factors such as wave length, leakage direction, current speed, wind speed, oil density, and leaking rate are analyzed by numerical simulation. The calculation results indicates that wave length affects both the underwater spread and drift process, while current speed and wind speed mainly influence the drift process. Leakage direction, oil density and leaking rate have significant influence on underwater spread process but limited effect on drift process. A formula is proposed to predict the oil diffusion distance at certain time. The results of investigation can offer a valuable guidance for formulation of emergency response."}{"Powerful combination of MOFs and C3N4 for enhanced photocatalytic performance ": "Both pristine metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) displayed outstanding photocatalytic performances toward H2 production, CO2 reduction, Cr(VI) reduction and organic pollutants degradation. To further enhance their photocatalytic performances under visible light or sunlight irradiation, MOFs and g-C3N4 were combined to construct g-C3N4/MOF heterojunctions with the purpose of overcoming their individual disadvantages like fast recombination of pohotogenerated electron-hole pairs. The fabrication methods, characterizations, photocatalytic performances and the corresponding mechanism of some typical g-C3N4/MOF composites were highlighted.

In this work, a novel CoFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) coupled with NiFe-LDH nanosheet array supported on nickel foam (denoted as CoFe@NiFe/NF) is developed through a facile hydrothermal and electrodeposition method. Remarkably, benefiting from strong synergistic effect between CoFe-LDH and NiFe-LDH and the unique structural features, the resulting CoFe@NiFe/NF architectures catalyst exhibits excellent activities and stabilities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, an efficient and stable alkali-electrolyzer using CoFe@NiFe/NF as both the cathode and anode achieve a voltage of 1.59\u2009V at the current density of 10\u2009mA cm\u22122, which is superior to many other state-of-the-art earth-abundant electrocatalysts.

However, several drawbacks, such as the low-speed generation of Fe(II), high consumption of H2O2, and acidic reaction conditions (generally at \u02dc pH 3), are always the core issues that hamper the large-scale application of heterogeneous Fenton reactions in environmental remediation. Thus, a large number of studies have been devoted to tackling these drawbacks, and this paper intends to comprehensively review the developed strategies for enhancing heterogeneous Fenton reactivity, mainly over the last decade. Based on a comprehensive survey of previous studies, we categorize these strategies according to their reaction mechanisms. For example, introducing additional electrons (e.g., from external electric fields, electron-rich materials, semiconductors, plasmonic materials, or doped metals) to heterogeneous Fenton catalysts can accelerate the generation of Fe(II); the in situ generation of H2O2 can be achieved by combining ultrasound, electricity, semiconductors, and iron-based catalysts in the system; and controlling the specific morphologies and exposed facets of heterogeneous Fenton catalysts can greatly promote the decomposition of H2O2. In addition, we briefly introduce some recent novel heterogeneous Fenton-like reactions that are of particular interest, including constructing dual reaction centers (i.e., the electron-poor center and the electron-rich center) and synthesizing single-atom catalysis-based heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts. Moreover, this review article analyzes and compares the merits of each strategy for enhancing heterogeneous Fenton/Fenton-like reactions. We believe this review can motivate the construction of novel and efficient heterogeneous Fenton/Fenton-like systems and help readers choose proper Fenton/Fenton-like reaction systems for industrial applications."}{"Construction of g-C3N4/PDI@MOF heterojunctions for the highly efficient visible light-driven degradation of pharmaceutical and phenolic micropollutants ": "A novel g-C3N4/PDI@MOF heterojunction was synthesized by the in situ growth of NH2-MIL-53(Fe) onto the g-C3N4/PDI layer. The heterojunction was applied as a photocatalyst for the removal of pharmaceutical and phenolic micropollutants in the present of H2O2 and visible LED light (420\u2009<\u2009\u03bb\u2009<\u2009800\u2009nm). The synergistic heterojunction displays excellent photocatalytic performance for the removal of several water-soluble and toxic organic pollutants (50\u2009ppm) under visible light irradiation, with a maximum efficiency of up to 90% (1\u2009h) for tetracycline (TC), 78% (2.5\u2009h) for carbamazepine (CBZ), 100% (10\u2009min) for bisphenol A (BPA) and 100% (30\u2009min) for p-nitrophenol (PNP). Furthermore, the low concentration of phenolic organic pollutants (2\u2009ppm) can also be rapidly degraded into small molecules (analyzed by HPLC) within 10\u2009min. This performance is superior to some previously reported visible-light photocatalysts. The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the efficient formation of heterojunctions derived from the interface contact and electronic band structure matching between g-C3N4/PDI and NH2-MIL-53(Fe), which is beneficial to charge separation and facilitates the photodegradation process. Repeated experimental studies and structural analysis of photocatalyst before and after degradation (XRD and FT-IR) demonstrated that the photocatalyst exhibits good stability and reusability. This work provides a new insight into the construction of heterojunction photocatalysts based on Fe-MOF for the heterogeneous photodegradation of organic contaminants with H2O2 under visible light."}{"Cobalt- and nitrogen-codoped porous carbon catalyst made from core\u2013shell type hybrid metal\u2013organic framework (ZIF-L@ZIF-67) and its efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity ": "The development of carbon-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts to substitute the expensive and unstable platinum-based ORR catalysts is of great importance for their optimal utilization in energy conversion and storage. Herein, we report the production of highly active carbon-based ORR catalyst from well-designed core\u2013shell type hybrid metal\u2013organic framework (MOF). Cobalt- and nitrogen-codoped porous carbon leaves (Co,N-PCLs) are prepared via a simple one-step pyrolysis of well-designed leaf-shaped core-shell type hybrid MOFs (ZIF-L@ZIF-67, ZIF (zeolitic imidazolate framework) is a subclass of MOF), which contain two different metal ions (Zn2+ in core and Co2+ in shell) and sufficient nitrogen source with a thin flat morphology. The structural and compositional features of resulting Co,N-PCLs are characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and N2 sorption isotherms, and the analyses reveal that they possess the ideal structural and compositional features for ORR, such as numerous carbon nanotubes (CNTs), substantial Co- and N-doping, large surface area, and high pore volume while maintaining the advantageous thin leaf-shape. Owing to such unique structural and compositional features, Co,N-PCLs display much better ORR activity than their counterparts prepared from the parent materials (ZIF-L or ZIF-67). In addition, Co,N-PCL even shows a better electrochemical stability and a better methanol tolerance compared to commercial Pt/C material."}{"Liquid exfoliation of g-C3N4 nanosheets to construct 2D-2D MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity ": "Although graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is an attractive photocatalyst for solar H2 generation, the preparation of g-C3N4 nanosheets via a \u201cgreen\u201d and simple method as well as the construction of highly-efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are still challenges. In this study, g-C3N4 nanosheets prepared by a simple probe sonication assisted liquid exfoliation method were used to construct 2D-2D MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production. The 2D-2D MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst containing 0.75% MoS2 showed the highest H2 evolution rate of 1155 \u03bcmol\u00b7h\u22121\u00b7g\u22121 with an apparent quantum yield of 6.8% at 420 nm monochromatic light, which is much higher than that of the optimized 0D-2D Pt/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The high photocatalytic H2 production activity of 2D-2D MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst can be attributed to the large surface area and the formed 2D interfaces between MoS2 and g-C3N4 nanosheets. As demonstrated by photoluminescence quenching and time-resolved fluorescence decay studies, the 2D interfaces can accelerate the photoinduced charge transfer, resulting in the high photocatalytic H2 production performance. This study provides a new strategy in developing highly-efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for H2 production via using 2D nanojunction as a bridge to promote the photoinduced charge separation and transfer."}{"Porous nitrogen-rich g-C3N4 nanotubes for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction ": "The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuels and valuable chemicals using solar energy is a promising method for reducing CO2 emissions and solving energy supply issues.

The prepared catalysts were systematically characterized to explore the relationship between their characteristics and catalytic activities. In general, higher specific surface area, larger pore volume, more hydroxyl groups, and more accessible reactive sites of 40%-CuFe2O4/kaolinite contributed to the greater catalytic activity in peroxymonosulfate activation for BPA degradation compared to bare CuFe2O4. Monodispersed CuFe2O4 nanoparticles were uniformly anchored on the surface of kaolinite with FeOAl bond, which prevented leaching of metal ions and contributed to the excellent reusability. The sulfate radicals produced in the CuFe2O4/kaolinite/PMS system were proved as the predominant radical species through electron spin resonance (ESR) and radical quenching experiments. Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance \u2013 Fourier transform infrared spectra (ATR-FTIR), two main possible pathways of sulfate radicals generation were proposed: the generation and decomposition of Cu(II)-(HO)OSO3\n                     \u2212 (Cu(II)/Cu(III) and Cu(III)/Cu(II) redox reaction) and the oxidation of Fe(II).

To address these two issues, a facile and economical strategy is demonstrated for the preparation of the bimetallic sulfides anchored three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped graphene foam (MoS2-NiS2/NGF) hybrid for efficient overall water splitting. As a result, strong interactions occur between MoS2-NiS2 nanoparticles and NGF with unique 3D interconnected tubular hollow structure, leading to the superior performance towards HER and OER. The overpotential and charge transfer resistance of the hybrid are much lower than those of the bare NGF, MoS2/NGF, NiS2/NGF, and physically mixed MoS2-NiS2 + NGF, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of NGF and bimetallic sulfides with hetero interfaces, thus endowing MoS2-NiS2/NGF abundant active sites and diversified pathways for highly-efficient transport of mass and electron.

The morphology of Bi2MoO6 grown on the surface of ZnO nanorods could be controlled by adjusting the experimental conditions. The synthesized samples were characterized by various analytical techniques and their photocatalytic performance was evaluated by photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) under visible-light irradiation. Compared with those of pure Bi2MoO6 and ZnO, the Bi2MoO6/ZnO composites showed higher photocatalytic activity towards the reduction of Cr(VI). The enhanced photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to the formation of a heterojunction between Bi2MoO6 and ZnO, which effectively facilitated the separation and transfer of electrons and holes. In addition, the Bi2MoO6/ZnO photocatalysts maintained good stability after three cycles of Cr(VI) photoreduction. A possible photocatalytic mechanism of the as-synthesized composites was proposed."}{"Activated TiO2 with tuned vacancy for efficient electrochemical nitrogen reduction ": "Renewable energy-driven electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) provides a green and sustainable route for NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions but is plagued by a high reaction barrier and low selectivity.

Nevertheless, the catalytic efficiency of MoS2 is significantly restricted by its density of catalytic active sites and inert basal plane.

The as-prepared Cu@MoS2 sample exhibits enhanced HER performance with a low overpotential of 131 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2, a small Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec and as well as a good long-term stability. Enhanced HER performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of 1T-MoS2 metallic phase, single atom Cu doping and numerous sulfur vacancies. Theoretical calculations indicates that the adsorption energy of Cu atom on 1T-MoS2 surface (\u22123.68 eV) is much higher than that on 2H-MoS2 surface (\u22121.94 eV), moreover, the Cu atom adsorbed on the surface of the 1T-MoS2 has larger charge transfer (\u22120.38e), which can be contributed to further enhance HER performance of 1T-MoS2."}{"One-step in-situ preparation of N-doped TiO2@C derived from Ti3C2 MXene for enhanced visible-light driven photodegradation ": "As the most promising environment-friendly photocatalyst, titanium dioxide admittedly has two shortcomings of low sunlight utilization efficiency and poor quantum yield.

Significantly, DQTP COF-Co exhibits a high CO production rate of 1.02\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 \u03bcmol h\u22121\u2009g\u22121, while DQTP COF-Zn has a high selectivity (90% over CO) for formic acid generation (152.5\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009h\u22121\u2009g\u22121). This work highlights the great potential of using stable COFs as platforms to anchor earth-abundant metal active sites for heterogeneous CO2 reduction."}{"Tremella-like Ni3S2/MnS with ultrathin nanosheets and abundant oxygen vacancies directly used for high speed overall water splitting ": "The development of highly active and stable non-noble metal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional performances is crucial for efficient water splitting. In this work, such electrocatalysts are obtained, first in two-step hydrothermal reactions to form Ni3S2/MnS nanosheets on Ni foam (NF/Ni3S2/MnS), then by slightly electroxidizing the Ni3S2/MnS to generate tremella-like Ni3S2/MnS-O with ultrathin nanosheets and abundant oxygen vacancies (denoted as NF/T(Ni3S2/MnS-O)) favorable for electrocatalyzing HER and OER. Benefiting from the abundant oxygen vacancies, tremella-like ultrathin nanosheets with hierarchical porous structure and large active surface area, NF/T(Ni3S2/MnS-O) shows high catalytic performance, including lower overpotential and electrochemistry stability for both HER and OER than so far reported MnOx and other metal oxides/sulfides. The NF/T(Ni3S2/MnS-O) directly used as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting exhibits a low voltage of 1.54\u202fV with a low overpotential of 0.31\u202fV at a current density of 10\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122, a fast H2 and O2 evolution speed of 4.13 and 2.04\u202f\u03bcmol min\u22121 and a good electrochemistry stability with unchanged current density of 10\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122 for 50 h."}{"In-situ pyrolysis of Enteromorpha as carbocatalyst for catalytic removal of organic contaminants: Considering the intrinsic N/Fe in Enteromorpha and non-radical reaction ": "An environmentally friendly, facile, and economical Fe/N co-doped carbonaceous material (Fe-N@C) was prepared by the in-situ pyrolysis of Fe/N rich Enteromorpha biomass for peroxymonosulfate activation and organic contaminants degradation. Results indicated that Enteromorpha-based catalysts prepared at high pyrolysis temperature displayed some highly graphitic nanosheets with rich nitrogen doped. The graphitic N derived from the intrinsic N in Enteromorpha showed the high correlation with the paracetamol (PCM) removal rate; this was confirmed by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation, showing the high adsorption energy (\u0394Eads, \u22122.62\u2009eV) of PMS molecular adsorbed onto the graphitic N area. A weak correlation between the PCM removal rate and adsorption capacity was also observed, revealing that the PCM catalytic reaction could be greatly accelerated after the pre-adsorption. It was interesting that the intrinsic Fe in Enteromorpha did not affect the PCM degradation, but PCM removal rate of acid treated Fe-N/C was improved as more active sites were formed after the Fe extraction by acid treatment. Both the radical pathways of O2\n                     \n                        \n                     \n                     \u2212 and non-radical 1O2 generated in the Fe-N@C/PMS system were the primary mechanisms for the PCM degradation, which was consistent with the Fukui function values of f\u00b0 and f- based on the DFT calculation. In addition, high stability of the carbon-based catalysts was observed after three runs and calcinating regeneration, which showed the promising applications for environmental remediation."}{"Microplastics accumulate on pores in seed capsule and delay germination and root growth of the terrestrial vascular plant Lepidium sativum\n             ": "The impacts of nano- and microplastics (<100\u202fnm and <5\u202fmm, respectively) on terrestrial systems is to the present largely unexplored. Plastic particles are likely to accumulate in these systems primarily by the application of sewage sludge. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of three sizes of plastic particles (50, 500, and 4800\u202fnm) on a terrestrial plant (cress; Lepidium sativum), using a standardized 72\u202fh bioassay. Cress seeds were exposed to five different concentrations of plastics, ranging from 103 to 107 particles mL\u22121. Germination rate was significantly reduced after 8\u202fh of exposure for all three sizes of plastics, with increased adverse effect with increasing plastic sizes. Seeds exposed to 4800\u202fnm microplastics showed a germination rate decline from 78% in control to 17% in the highest exposure. No difference in germination rate occurred after 24\u202fh of exposure, regardless of the size of the plastic used. Significant differences in root growth were observed after 24\u202fh, but not after 48 or 72\u202fh of exposure. Impacts on germination are likely due to physical blockage of the pores in the seed capsule by microplastics as shown by confocal microscopy of fluorescent microplastics. In later stages, the microplastics particularly accumulated on the root hairs. This is the first detailed study on the effect of nano- and microplastics on a vascular, terrestrial plant, and our results indicate short-term and transient adverse effects."}{"Removal of heavy metals from water sources in the developing world using low-cost materials: A review ": "Heavy metal contamination is a growing concern in the developing world. Inadequate water and wastewater treatment, coupled with increased industrial activity, have led to increased heavy metal contamination in rivers, lakes, and other water sources in developing countries. However, common methods for removing heavy metals from water sources, including membrane filtration, activated carbon adsorption, and electrocoagulation, are not feasible for developing countries. As a result, a significant amount of research has been conducted on low-cost adsorbents to evaluate their ability to remove heavy metals. In this review article, we summarize the current state of research on the removal of heavy metals with an emphasis on low-cost adsorbents that are feasible in the context of the developing world. This review evaluates the use of adsorbents from four major categories: agricultural waste; naturally-occurring soil and mineral deposits; aquatic and terrestrial biomass; and other locally-available waste materials. Along with a summary of the use of these adsorbents in the removal of heavy metals, this article provides a summary of the influence of various water-quality parameters on heavy metals and these adsorbents. The proposed adsorption mechanisms for heavy metal removal are also discussed."}{"Occurrence of pesticides in Dutch drinking water sources ": "We determined pesticide occurrence in groundwater and surface water sources used for drinking water production in The Netherlands, using both routine monitoring data from Dutch drinking water companies and by studying the presence of newly authorized pesticides in drinking water sources.\n                  An analytical LC-MS/MS method was developed for 24 recently authorized pesticides, selected based on their mobility and persistence, and applied in a Dutch/Belgian ground- and surface water monitoring campaign. 15 of these pesticides were detected, including seven in concentrations above the water quality standard from the Water Framework Directive. Two neonicotinoids were detected in highest concentrations: acetamiprid (1.1\u202f\u03bcg/L) and thiamethoxam (0.4\u202f\u03bcg/L).\n                  The routine monitoring data was collected over 2010\u20132014 in The Netherlands, covering 408 pesticides and 52 metabolites. 63 pesticides and 6 metabolites were prioritized according to their presence in groundwater, surface water and drinking water. The vast majority of the pesticides in routine monitoring has not been detected or only in low concentrations.\n                  Overall, the study shows that pesticides are of major concern in drinking water sources across the Netherlands. In two third of the abstraction areas pesticides and/or metabolites have been detected. In one third of the abstraction areas pesticide and/or metabolites concentration exceeded water quality standards according to the Water Framework Directive. The results emphasize that monitoring should focus on priority pesticides, since the vast majority of the pesticides has a low priority. The occurrence of recently authorized pesticides in drinking water sources demonstrates the importance to keep routine monitoring methods up to date."}{"Graphene and graphene-based nanocomposites used for antibiotics removal in water treatment: A review ": "Due to their extensive application in human and veterinary medicine, antibiotics have been found worldwide and studied as new pollutants in the aquatic environment. In order to remove such pollutants, adsorption and photocatalysis have attracted tremendous attention because of their great potential in antibiotics removal from aqueous solutions. Graphene, as a novel two-dimensional nanomaterial, possesses unique structure and physicochemical properties, which can be used to efficiently adsorb and photodegrade antibiotics. This review provides an overview of the adsorptive and catalytic properties of graphene, and recent advances in adsorption and photodegradation of antibiotics by graphene and its derivatives. The factors that affect the adsorption and photodegradation of antibiotics are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of adsorption and photodegradation are summarized and analyzed. Meanwhile, statistical analysis is conducted based on the number of papers and the maximum adsorption and photodegradation ability on various antibiotics removal. Finally, some unsolved problems together with major challenges that exist in the fabrication and application of graphene-based nanocomposites and the development for antibiotics removal is also proposed. This work provides theoretical guidance for subsequent research in the field of adsorption and photocatalytic removal of antibiotics from aqueous solution, especially on influence factors and mechanisms aspects."}{"Waste incineration of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to evaluate potential formation of per- and Poly-Fluorinated Alkyl Substances (PFAS) in flue gas ": "In recent years, concerns over some per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) have grown steadily. PFAS are a large group of chemical substances with widely differing properties. While one class of PFAS, fluoropolymers, have been demonstrated to meet the OECD criteria for polymers of low concern during the in use phase of their lifecycle, questions remain regarding waste handling at the end of useful life for products containing fluoropolymers. To show that polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) can be almost fully transformed into fluorine (F) (as hydrofluoric acid (HF)) and to study the possible generation of low molecular weight per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), PTFE combustion under typical waste incineration conditions at the BRENDA (German acronym for \u201cBrennkammer mit Dampfkessel\u201d) pilot plant at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) was investigated. Results indicate that, within procedural quantitation limits, no statistically significant evidence was found that the PFAS studied were created during the incineration of PTFE. Therefore, municipal incineration of PTFE using best available technologies (BAT) is not a significant source of the studied PFAS and should be considered an acceptable form of waste treatment."}{"A prototype of a portable optical sensor for the detection of transparent and translucent microplastics in freshwater ": "Microplastic pollution in water bodies is an alarming problem which needs to be addressed. However, issues such as size, shape and their appearance to light (transparent or translucent) make it difficult to be optically detected. Here, a feasibility study of a portable prototype optical sensor with the capability of measuring simultaneously specular laser light reflection and transmission from microplastic particles is presented. The specular reflection signal and the transmitted interference pattern were recorded with a photodiode and a CCD camera, respectively. With the combination of these two modes of detection, it is possible to screen the type, size, and nonplanarity of two microplastics types, i.e., transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and translucent low-density polyethylene (LDPE), in a volume of freshwater, with high confidence. In principle, the prototype could be used for the detection of both floating microplastics as well as microplastics experiencing sedimentation in natural water bodies, and in water filtration in water treatment plants."}{"The adsorption, regeneration and engineering applications of biochar for removal organic pollutants: A review ": "In recent years, with the continuous development of industry and agriculture, the content of organic pollutants in the environment has been increasing, which has caused serious pollution to the environment. Adsorption has proven to be an effective and economically viable method of removing organic contaminants. Since biochar has many advantages such as various types of raw materials, low cost, and recyclability, it can achieve the effect of turning waste into treasure when used for environmental treatment. This paper summarizes the source and production of biochar, points out its research status in the removal of organic pollutants, expounds its adsorption mechanism on organic pollutants, introduces the relevant adsorption parameters, summarizes its regeneration methods, studies its application of engineering, and finally analyses of benefits and describes the development prospects."}{"Produced water characteristics, treatment and reuse: A review ": "In oil and gas industry, produced water is considered as the largest waste stream, which contains relatively higher concentration of hydrocarbons, heavy metals and other pollutants. Due to the increase in industrial activities, the generation of produced water has increased all over the world and its treatment for reuse is now important from environmental perspective. Treatment of produced water can be done through various methods including physical (membrane filtration, adsorption etc.), chemical (precipitation, oxidation), and biological (activated sludge, biological aerated filters and others) methods. This paper aims to highlight characteristics of produced water in detail and physical, chemical, and biological techniques used for its treatment. In addition, reuse of produced water for different purposes has been discussed. At the end, few case studies from different countries, related to the treatment and reuse of their produced waters have been included."}{"Microalgae cultivation for municipal and piggery wastewater treatment in Brazil ": "Microalgae are a source of high-valuable products covering a wide range of applications. However, costs incurred by cultivating them make it an expensive process. The combination of wastewater treatment and microalgae cultivation is a viable option to reduce expenses related to cultivation. However, municipal wastewater from the centralized Brazilian sanitation system is highly diluted, and it is technically and economically impractical to use it for microalgae cultivation. As an alternative, diluted effluent can be mixed with a different kind of wastewater, aiming to increase the nutrient concentration (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) for microalgae cultivation. In this study, microalgae cultivation and wastewater mixture (municipal and piggery wastewater) treatment were monitored for four weeks. The pilot treatment system consisted of UASB as pre-treatment and Chlorella sorokiniana cultivation in three flat panel photobioreactors. High UASB efficiency was obtained in organic matter removal (> 90%), even with a large variability of initial mixture characteristics. C. sorokiniana production reached about 1\u2009g\u2009L\u22121, with an average removal of dissolved inorganic carbon, orthophosphate and ammonia around 46 to 56%, 40 to 60% and 100%, respectively. Possible solutions to improve the microalgae growth and the system treatment are discussed."}{"A review on nanotechnological application of magnetic iron oxides for heavy metal removal ": "With increasing trend in industrialization, heavy metals possess a great threat to the environment due to their discharge in water and wastewater above permissible limits. Heavy metals have toxic effects on human and environment. However, advancement in newly budding and fangled nanotechnology offers better treatment techniques. Development of novel and cost-effective 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D nanomaterials for environmental remediation, pollution detection and other applications has attracted considerable attention. Zero valent iron and iron oxide nanoparticles are found to be the best candidates for heavy metal adsorption and removal. Various mechanical, optical and electrical properties of nanoparticles play important role in nanoparticle formation and interaction. Forms of iron oxide such as hematite (\u03b1 Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles of varied morphology and size (10\u2009nm, 20\u2009nm, 50\u2009nm etc.) were synthesized by various methods like sol-gel, precipitation, hydrothermal processes and magnetic nano-composites with different iron precursors (iron acetate, iron nitrate, ferric chloride, ferrous sulphate etc.). Iron oxide nanoparticles (in a variety of chemical and structural forms) have already exhibited its diversity and potential in many frontiers of environmental area. Present review is focused on the application of iron and iron oxide nanoparticles towards heavy metal removal."}{"3D printing and surface imprinting technologies for water treatment: A review ": "In recent times, 3D printing as a technology has drawn tremendous attention. Also, surface imprinting techniques in general are still evolving especially in the area of membrane design and fabrication. This paper focuses on the different 3D printing techniques in relation to the recent advances and its applications for the fabrication of module spacers and membranes for water treatment. The recent developments in surface imprinting in the area of water treatment and membrane design are also discussed in this paper. Looking at the recent developments in 3D printing technology for water treatment, revolutionary fabrication of novel membrane module components is likely to happen soon. Enhancement of 3D printing technologies in areas of materials, resolution, and speed is expected to increase the applicability of 3D printing technologies in the production of different membrane module components with high efficiency. In the near future, surface imprinting patterns of complex topography can improve performance of 3D printed membranes with applications in water purification and membrane separation."}{"Forward osmosis research trends in desalination and wastewater treatment: A review of research trends over the past decade ": "Issues of water scarcity and water security have driven the rapid development of various technologies to ensure water sustainability. The forward osmosis (FO) membrane process has been widely recognized as one of the more promising technologies to play an important role in alleviating the issues of water sustainability. Extensive research has been carried out worldwide to explore the potential of FO in desalination, water and wastewater treatment and reclamation. It is of the utmost importance to understand the topics of interest and research trends to further advance the development of FO process technology. In this study, a bibliometric analysis based on the Scopus database was carried out to identify and understand the global research trends of FO process based on 6 main analyses: basic growth trends, journals, countries, institutions, authors, and keywords. A total of 1462 article records published between 1967\u20132018 were extracted from Scopus and used as the raw data for bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software. The total number of FO articles has sharply increased since 2009 and stabilized at around 250 publications in the past three years. The increase could be associated with the breakthrough in FO membrane science, where the contributions were from the 5 most productive countries: USA, China, Singapore, Australia, and South Korea. FO research started to diversify after the appearance of commercial FO membranes with improved characteristics, enabling the researchers to employ them for various application studies. Keywords analysis showed that the main directions of FO research could be categorized into three clusters: application of FO, membrane fouling study, and FO membrane synthesis. These bibliometric results provide a valuable reference and information on current research directions of FO for researchers and industry practitioners who are interested in FO technology."}{"Hybrid anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment for real textile wastewater ": "In this study, working of hybrid anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment technology for real textile wastewater was investigated on the basis of system evaluation and optimization in two phases. In Phase I, system was optimized at laboratory scale on synthetic textile wastewater and later real textile wastewater was treated in Phase II. The study was conducted for 242 days in which industrial discharge coming from textile mill was collected and subjected to laboratory scale hybrid treatment. Activated sludge used in the process was obtained from full scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) plant and adapted to the synthetic and real textile wastewater using anaerobic process. Individual application of anaerobic treatment was found to be insufficient for the removal of COD, TKN and dyes. The proposed combine hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system was found to be effective in reporting removal efficiencies of 99.5% COD, 99.3% TKN, and 78.4% dyes. The anaerobic SBR added value to the hybrid system as it played a key role in improving treatment efficiency in addition to the production of sustainable energy source of biogas. Study shows that aerobic treatment is required to increase the treatment level by providing the final polishing to anaerobically treated effluent in order to reclaim water. The optimum HRT for hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system in treating real textile wastewater was found to be 54\u2009h for maximum COD removal. The implication of this work is the industrial application of hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system for reuse of water in agricultural and industrial sectors."}{"Ammonia inhibition and toxicity in anaerobic digestion: A critical review ": "As a waste management technology which offers environmental benefit and renewable energy production, anaerobic digestion (AD) has become the preferred technology for the treatment of organic waste. However, in such waste streams nitrogen contents are likely to be high. There is prevailing literature evidence suggests that high ammonia concentration especially its free molecular form (NH3), derived from nitrogen content in substrates is the cause of inhibition and sudden failure of the AD process.\n                  This paper comprehensively reviews previous knowledge from digestion studies using high nitrogen waste streams as feedstocks and critically analysed the considerable variations in the inhibition/toxicity levels reported for ammonia. Literature evidences suggest methanogens, particularly acetoclastic methanogens are most susceptible to ammonia toxicity, and therefore this review has a particular focus on the mechanism of the \u2018selective\u2019 inhibition to methanogens and the impact of ammonia toxicity to the overall methanogen population in an AD digester. This population change explains in many reported cases that sufficient acclimatisation can significantly alleviate the phenomenon of inhibition and specific requirement of certain trace nutrients. Currently available mitigation strategies for high nitrogen content feedstock digestion are reviewed and discussed in relation to the population change and trace nutrient requirements."}{"Degradation of Ibuprofen by UV-LED/catalytic advanced oxidation process ": "Ibuprofen (IBP), a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, has been detected in many rivers and lake waters. This study was aimed to degrade the ibuprofen from synthetic wastewater by using UV-LED/catalytic and UV-LED/oxidants advanced oxidation process. The degradation of IBP was investigated with ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) irradiation in presence of Titanium dioxide (TiO2), Zinc oxide (ZnO), Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Potassium peroxomonosulfte (PMS) and Potassium peroxodisulfate (PDS). It was observed that the degradation of IBP was directly influenced by the pH of IBP solution, and higher degradation rate was observed at lower pH values. The study on effect of irradiation time showed that both TiO2 and ZnO can completely degrade the IBP within 90\u2009min, while H2O2, PMS, and PDS degraded 38%, 55%, and 74% IBP respectively. The UV-LED/TiO2 system was found to be the most efficient among all selected systems (UV-LED/ZnO; UV-LED/H2O2; UV-LED/PMS; UV-LED/PDS). The SPME (Solid phase microextraction)/GC\u2013MS was used for the better illustration of Ibuprofen degradation mechanism and to identify generated byproduct in the degradation process. Four byproducts(benzene 1-ethenyl-4-(2-methypropyl), benzene 1-(1-hydroxyethyl)-4-isobutyl, 4\u2032-(2-methylpropyl)acetophenone, ibuprofen methyl ester) were detected after UV-LED catalytic degradation of IBP solution. The present study showed that the UV-LED/catalyst process significantly enhanced the degradation of IBP in comparison to direct photolysis by UV-LED."}{"Treatment of textile industry wastewater by electrocoagulation coupled with electrochemical advanced oxidation process ": "The present study deals with the treatment of real effluents, containing a mixture of reactive dyes (mainly methylene blue), by electrocoagulation (EC) coupled with electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) such as peroxi-coagulation (PC), anodic oxidation (AO), and electro-Fenton (EF), individually. To choose the right treatment process, the key criteria should be higher degradation efficiency and minimal energy consumption. Textile effluents are physico-chemical characterized and the operating parameters i.e. the initial pH, the current density, and the electrolysis time, were investigated. Wastewater treatment energy consumption was evaluated for each combined process. The results highlighted high efficiency of electrochemical processes in effective degradation of organic pollutants at the optimum operating conditions. Among the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes tested, sequential EC-EF treatment was being preferred and quite effective since it provided electro generated hydroxyl radical \n                        \n                     OH especially when using the boron-doped diamond. Thus, removals of 97%, 100% and 100% for, respectively, TOC, turbidity and color removal were achieved by using the EC-EF combined process. Energy consumption values were evaluated for textile dye decolorization as 0.45\u20131.5\u202fkW\u202fh\u202fkg\u22121 of the removed TOC, depending on the applied current density. Regarding the efficiency level and the operating cost, the EC-EF combined process offers many advantages allowing the reuse of the treated water for other purposes."}{"Investigation of membrane fouling in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating pharmaceutical wastewater ": "This study is focused on the fouling of flat-sheet and hollow-fiber membranes in a lab-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). A comprehensive investigation including scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), zeta potential, optical profilometer and contact angle, and flux modelling was presented in this study. The effect of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) accumulated on cake-layer were also considered. The cake-layer on the flat-sheet membrane formed much more than that on the hollow-fiber membrane. The thickness of cake-layer on the flat-sheet membrane was effectively decreased by physical stripping. However, proteins indicating structures of Amide I and Amide II, and carbohydrates were observed on the stripped hollow-fiber membrane. According to the flux modelling results, the cake-layer formation and intermediate-adsorption were found as effective mechanisms on both membranes. Especially, these mechanisms were more effective for the hollow-fiber membrane due to irreversible fouling."}{"Removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater using reverse osmosis for its subsequent reuse: Pilot plant ": "The presence in natural watercourses of different types of emerging contaminants (including stimulants and antibiotics) from different sources constitutes a serious environmental issue. The problem is aggravated in regions where water is scarce and its reuse should form part of its integrated cycle. The removal of these contaminants, so that the water may be reused, is currently one of the most widely studied issues in the field of wastewater treatment. Within this context, the present paper addresses the removal of different contaminants (caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, amoxicillin, and penicillin G). The chosen treatment was the use of reverse osmosis membranes, which were installed at the outlet of the secondary settling tank of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Medina Sidonia (SW Spain), carrying out sampling in the feed, reject and permeate streams over a period of 72\u2009h. DOW-FILMTEC BW30-2540 membranes were used for this purpose, operating at a pressure of 15\u2009bar. The emerging contaminants were analysed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The applied treatments allowed a contaminant-free permeate to be obtained with the required quality for its reuse. This technique achieved 100% removal of the contaminants without signs of membrane deterioration after running the 72\u2009h test."}{"Treat-to-Target Approach in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: The Role of Advanced Practice Providers ": "Updated therapeutic guidelines for inflammatory bowel disease call for effective disease assessment, early intervention, and personalized patient care using a treat-to-target (T2T) approach. The ongoing, intensive monitoring of a T2T strategy is best facilitated by a multidisciplinary team, but the increased demand on health care systems impedes implementation. Therefore, advanced practice providers have a growing role in bridging the gap between T2T recommendations and clinical practice. Advanced practice providers can effectively facilitate patient-care team communication, deliver patient education, perform in-clinic and remote monitoring of symptoms and treatment response, and assist patients with self-management."}{"Nurse Practitioner Transition to Practice: Development of a Residency Program ": "Nurse practitioner residency programs assist new graduates to transition to practice. This article describes the development of a primary care nurse practitioner residency program at a large academic medical center in the mid-Atlantic region. Organizational factors related to program development and support as well as fiscal and human resource considerations are presented. Curricular considerations inclusive of both clinical and didactic content are presented in conjunction with a curricular outline. Finally, recommendations for nurse practitioner residency program development and expansion within academic and nonacademic medical centers are provided."}{"Improving patient transportation in hospitals using a mixed-integer programming model ": "This paper investigates the current patient transportation between care units in a large hospital to determine possible solutions to reduce total completion times of demands. The goal is to avoid major changes in the current staff schedules. Historical data of the service calls is available and an in-depth analysis is conducted to identify popular routes and current assignment of demands to patient transport employees. We present a mixed-integer model to determine the best distribution of the employees throughout the most popular routes of the hospital to minimize costs. Experiments are conducted on real data from CHU de Qu\u00e9bec-Universit\u00e9 Laval, HEJ, in the province of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Results obtained from assigning specific employees to routes instead of the current method, which consists at assigning employees to all of the hospital are compared and show that there is a gain in doing so."}{"Optimal integration of desensitization protocols into kidney paired donation (KPD) programs ": "Blood type (ABO) incompatibility and antibody to donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) remain the most significant barriers in transplantation. While pre-transplant desensitization can be administered to overcome such incompatibilities between living donors and their kidney recipients, desensitization alone is likely to fail for those pairs with significant incompatibilities. For these pairs, desensitization can be administered in combination with Kidney Paired Donor (KPD) exchange, the system that allows incompatible pairs to exchange donors with other incompatible pairs to improve donor\u2013recipient compatibilities. Prior operations research literature on KPD investigates the optimal strategy to match donors to patients within a given set of incompatible pairs. However, models and algorithms in these studies exclusively look for the best possible match without considering the possibility of combining KPD and desensitization therapy. The current study adapted the existing models to incorporate desensitization as a way to increase KPD efficiency and embedded it into a simulation framework to evaluate the impact of optimally integrating a desensitization protocol in a KPD program. This is the first attempt to quantify the benefit of such an integration. Our results indicated that desensitization as part of a KPD exchange program is a promising approach to improve access to and to reduce wait time for a living donor renal transplant."}{"Targeted multi-criteria optimisation in IMRT planning supplemented by knowledge based model creation ": "Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning is an inherently multi-criteria task. A multi-criteria workflow (MCW) typically passes the following steps: create an optimisation model with multiple criteria, approximate the Pareto frontier, and visualise the generated plans to the decision-maker (DM) for inspection. This interactive plan selection and manipulation allow to create better treatment plans as judged by physicians. However, once an optimisation model is specified, optimisation objectives cannot be modified any more. Thus this fixed model implies that a planner has to guess an appropriate model to begin with. Only after Pareto frontier approximation is calculated, the planner can assess the goodness of the model by exploring the trade-offs. The shortcoming of a MCW becomes apparent when the proposed model fails to generate expected trade-offs and the planner is thus forced to refine the model and repeat the calculations. To circumvent this drawback in the MCW, we propose a local multi-criteria workflow (L-MCW) designed and implemented in a collaboration between Fraunhofer ITWM and Varian Medical Systems. L-MCW enables local exploration around an initial, promising plan. The initial plan is automatically inferred by a knowledge-based algorithm (RapidPlan\u2122). The decision-maker can thus evaluate trade-offs in the most interesting region surrounding the initial plan. Clinical results of the combination of knowledge-based planning and L-MCW with a cohort of Prostate and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) Lung cases demonstrate substantially reduced planning time and improved organ-at-risk sparing compared to manual planning. The L-MCW provides an intuitive and flexible mechanism to adapt knowledge-based-planning models to similar, but not identical clinical situations and allows the practitioner to quickly determine and realise the most beneficial trade-offs in a treatment plan."}{"Synthesis and characterization of environmental friendly corncob biochar based nano-composite \u2013 A potential slow release nano-fertilizer for sustainable agriculture ": "Use of agriculture waste to develop value-added products has helped in resolving the waste management concernsalong with addressing the cost-effectiveness issues. Utilization of bio-char derived from agriculture waste back to the agriculture field marks the new strategy to improve crop yield and reduce environmental issues of conventional fertilizers. In addition to that it helps in improving soil condition by balancing the soil organic carbon, pH, water holding capacity and soil ion exchange potential. The present research work is based on the development of nano-composite based on biochar derived from corn cob and to check the suitability of corncob biochar(CB) as support material for providing macro and micro-nutrients to the plants on slow release basis.CBand its nano-composite (BNC) were synthesized by pyrolysis and simple impregnation method, respectively and characterized by FT-IR,SEM/EDX, powder XRD,AFMand TGA/DSC. Proximate analysis and physical properties were also examined by standard procedures whilestudies on water retention, water absorbance, swelling ratio and equilibrium water content of pointed to increased values of BNC as compared to CB. Slow release studies indicated release pattern of nutrients for prolonged period which is helpful in improving plant growth and yield. The experimental results indicated that the synthesized nano-composite is eco-friendly material and can be used as slow release fertilizer for sustainable agriculture."}{"Assessment of heavy metals contamination in selected tropical marine fish species in Bangladesh and their impact on human health ": "\u2022\n                           Chemical pollution in marine ecosystems is leading towards an increase in the concentrations of heavy metals in fish body, which might have a negative impact on human health through consumption of fish. Here, five commercially important marine fishes (i.e. Sillaginopsis panijus, Trichiurus lepturus, Harpadon nehereus, Rita rita and Coilia dussumieri) were collected from the Kutubdia Channel of the northern Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. Samples were collected during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon for the year of 2016 to measure the heavy metal concentrations in edible part (flesh) of the fishes; and finally to assess the human health risk due to consumption of those fishes. Heavy metal concentrations (i.e. Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Sn and As) in the collected fish species were determined using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) method. Subsequently, for assessing the human health risk, the target hazard quotient (THQ) values were estimated. This study found that the heavy metal concentration for Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Sn and As in fish samples were 1.51 to 2.53, 2.14 to 5.08, 2.89 to 3.41, 14.54 to 18.45, 23.04 to 32.21 and < 0.41\u2009mg/kg respectively as dry weight basis. This study also revealed that the THQ values for all studied metals in five species of fishes for both seasons were < 1, which indicating no cancer risk due to consumption of those fishes. On the other hand, the target cancer risk for Pb was found within an acceptable level (10\u22124 to 10-6). Therefore, it has been suggested that the selected tropical marine fishes might be free from contamination and human might be in safe from any risk due to consumption of those fishes."}{"Amoxicillin degradation using green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles: Kinetics and mechanism analysis ": "Beta-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin (AMX) removal in aqueous solution using green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles (gINPs) from Carob pod (Ceratonia siliqua) was studied. The characterization analyses of the gINPs were performed by TEM, SEM, EDX, XRD, BET, FESEM and Raman spectroscopy. The nanoparticles were found as oxide forms with the spherical shape at an average of 7\u2009\u00b1\u20095 nm dimensions with 7.67 m2/g surface area. The experimental analysis revealed that the amoxicillin removal efficiency depends on the initial pH, AMX concentration, temperature, and gINPs dose. High removal efficiency (99%) was obtained at a molar ratio of 1:50 AMX/gINPs in 200 min at pH 2. The removal of amoxicillin was investigated by the kinetic studies for the adsorption and degradation mechanisms. The kinetic analysis showed that the adsorption is a physical process with an activation energy of 30 kJ.mol\u22121. The removal process was determined as the pseudo-first-order following a chemically surface-controlled reaction due to the high activation energy of 87\u2009kJ.mol\u22121. The occurrence of AMX degradation products was detected by UV\u2013vis and HPLC/MS analyses. The potential degradation pathway of AMX using gINPs was determined as physical adsorption onto the iron corrosion products, and then reduction on the surface of gINPs."}{"Monitoring of engineered nanoparticles in soil-plant system: A review ": "Soil and water are the ultimate natural sink for the engineered nanoparticles (ENPs). One of the most significant factors which control the mobility and stability of colloidal suspension in soil along with the absorption, aggregation, and deposition depends on the surface properties of particular ENPs. The size and shape of the ENPs ultimately determine the degree of toxicology. Therefore, monitoring of nanoparticles in soil plant system is not merely essential, but more information is needed on their size allocation and physical properties. Various techniques have been found to be pertinent for ENPs characterization in toxicological and ecotoxicological studies. Information generated from these studies can be helpful in exact risk assessment which can then only be synchronized or used in standard testing. However, there exists a fair amount of demand for development of the newer and sophisticated technologies that can allow simultaneous determination of physical as well as chemical properties of nanoparticles present in the soil and plant samples. In this review, we have highlighted existing as well as promising developments in the area of ENPs detection and quantifications in soil-plant system. Further improvements in the analytical tools will be beneficial to understand the fate and transport of ENPs in soil plant system and nurture awareness of nanoparticle toxicology, their associated benefits and interrelated issues."}{"Leachate characterizations and pollution indices of active and closed unlined landfills in Malaysia ": "Leachate is one of the most serious environmental hazards associated with landfills especially which are unlined and uncontrolled. Thus, this study aims to characterize and compare raw leachate from active landfills (Ulu Maasop and Kampung Keru) and closed landfill (Pajam), then subsequently quantify the potential leachate contamination from each landfill using Leachate Pollution Index (LPI). The results obtained from the current study were compared with data from previous publications and indicated higher physico-chemical characterizations, especially for BOD and COD, than that of the other similar landfill categories. Based on the current findings, the low ratio of biodegradability and slightly alkaline pH values in leachate samples indicated that the sites (both active and closed landfills) were characterized by methanogenic conditions. Moreover, heavy metal concentrations, Cr, Fe and Se levels were higher than the leachate discharge standards for all leachate sampling sites. The As, Cu, and Mn, also surpassed the leachate discharge standards for the active landfill sites tested in this study (Ulu Maasop and Kampung Keru landfills). Next, the LPI calculated for Ulu Maasop, Kampung Keru, Pajam (1 and 2) landfills were 15.28, 13.89, 12.91 and 11.51, respectively, all exceeding the LPI for discharge standard of 5.696. Based on the leachate characterizations and the LPI values, these landfills pose a significant threat to the environment through the dissipation of leachate to the surface and groundwater, especially with the presence of BOD, COD, As and Cr. Thus, remedial actions such as rehabilitation of such unlined landfills and post-closure monitoring are crucial for both active and closed landfills to ensure the generated leachate is stabilized. Such actions will reduce and control the threat to the environment."}{"Ecotoxicological status and risk assessment of heavy metals in municipal solid wastes dumpsite impacted soil in Nigeria ": "Standard analytical protocols and pollution indices were used to evaluate eco-toxicological status and health risks of heavy metals contamination in municipal solid waste (MSW) impacted soil in Uyo, Nigeria. Heavy metals concentrations of soil were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES). The analysis shows ranges of extractable concentration of heavy metals in impacted soil samples during the wet season were Ni, 0.92\u20131.4\u2009mg/kg; Zn, 35.9\u201347.5\u2009mg/kg; Pb, 1.8\u20133.7\u2009mg/kg; Cr, 0.78\u20130.89\u2009mg/kg; Cd, 0.79\u20130.98\u2009mg/kg; As, 0.09\u20130.17\u2009mg/kg and Fe, 1108\u20131534\u2009mg/kg, while Ni, 0.124\u20131.4\u2009mg/kg; Zn, 7.22\u201327.5\u2009mg/kg; Pb, 1.72\u20132.98\u2009mg/kg; Cr, 0.066\u20130.389\u2009mg/kg, Cd, 0.94\u20134.12\u2009mg/kg; As, 0.018\u20130.1046\u2009mg/kg and Fe, 988.2\u20131411\u2009mg/kg were recorded during the dry season. Cumulative lifetime risks associated with exposures to potentially toxic metals through dermal, oral ingestion, and inhalation routes were evaluated for public health information and management. However, heavy metals contamination with potential carcinogenic risks to preteens was established. The risks however varied with the type of metal, level of contamination, season, and age. The analysis revealed very high carcinogenic lifetime risk among preteens through oral ingestion with cumulative risk mean value of 5.71E-03. Incremental lifetime cancer rate (ILCR) range of 1.00\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u20131.00\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 was obtained and cumulative risks associated with oral ingestion of metallic toxicants was higher during the wet season. The cumulative mean values recorded were 6.92 E-03, 2.73 E-03 and 9.39 E-04 for preteens, children and adults, respectively. The health risks associated with farming within dumpsite environ are high and should be prohibited."}{"Synthesis and characterization of antibiotic-metal complexes [FeCl3(L1)2H2O and Ni(NO3)2(L2)2H2O] and enhanced antibacterial activity ": "Antibacterial drugs can become more efficient against bacteria on coordination with transition metals. In this context, the current study focused on the synthesis and characterization of antibiotic metal complexes and in vitro evaluation of their antibacterial efficacy. The complex 1, FeCl3(L1)2H2O (Penicillin G and Iron) and complex 2, Ni(NO3)2(L2)2H2O (Ciprofloxacin and nickel) were synthesized via refluxing reaction and characterized by FTIR, TG/DTA, DLS, Powder XRD, FESEM, and Elemental analysis. Both the complexes were found to be biologically active with enhanced efficacy. Activities were measured by the zone of inhibition, minimal inhibitory concentration and growth pattern of bacteria. Serratia sp. R1, Serratia sp. W1 and Staphylococcus sp.Y1 were found to be sensitive against both, the complex 1 and complex 2 while Bacillus sp. K1 showed minor activity. Antibiotic-metal complex showed enhanced activity. Hence, a combination of antibiotics with metal salts may be an efficient and better option and might prove to be an alternative treatment against the resistant bacteria."}{"The occurrence of antibiotic-resistance genes in the Pilica River, Poland ": "The aim of study was to analyze the occurrence of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) in the Pilica River. Seasonal variations in the occurrence of ARGs in river water were also determined. Water samples were collected in 7 sites situated along a 186-km section of the Pilica River from Przedb\u00f3rz to estuary. River water was sampled four times between November 2017 and July 2018. Environmental DNA was isolated from water samples, and selected genes encoding resistance to tetracyclines (tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), tet(D), tet(E), beta-lactams (bla\n                     OXA, bla\n                     SHV, bla\n                     TEM, bla\n                     CTX-M), macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics (ermF and linA), sulfonamides (sul1), fluoroquinolones (aac(6\u2032)-Ib-cr) as well as the integrase 1 (intl1) gene and the 16S rRNA gene were amplified by standard PCR. ARGs were most prevalent and diverse in winter samples which harbored the intl1 gene and genes encoding resistance to beta-lactams, MLS antibiotics, sulfonamides and tetracyclines. The bla\n                     OXA and bla\n                     CTX-M genes were detected only in two autumn samples.

Variations in the prevalence of ARGs were not observed along the analyzed section of the Pilica River, which indicates that pollutant loads did not increase along the river continuum. It should be noted that selected genes (bla\n                     TEM, tet(A), tet(E), ermF, linA) were present in all or nearly all water samples regardless of sampling date or sampling site, which indicates that these ARGs are ubiquitous in the environment."}{"Estimation of near-saturated soil hydraulic properties using hybrid genetic algorithm-artificial neural network ": "Near-saturated hydraulic conductivity is one of the key parameters for water transport models in the unsaturated zone and essential for management practices. This study was conducted to compare efficacy of multiple linear regression (MLR) and hybrid method of genetic algorithm with artificial neural network (GA-ANN) for prediction of near-saturated soil hydraulic properties in Moghan plain, north-western Iran. The results of MLR analysis indicated that this method had low potential to predict near-saturated soil hydraulic properties in the study area, which only could explain 14\u201338% of variability in the studied properties. Otherwise, GA-ANN was much higher powerful that could explain about 35\u201380% of total variability in the mentioned properties in the study area. The results of sensitivity analysis suggest that soil particle size distribution, organic matter, electrical conductivity and relative bulk density were the most crucial with variety of priorities for explaining variability of the near-saturated soil hydraulic properties in the study area in the semiarid region. In overall, it was concluded that application of intelligent system using the easily available soil properties as predictors could provide reliable estimates of near-saturated soil hydraulic properties at the filed scale."}{"Hydrological regime change and its ecological responses in East Dongting Lake, China ": "Extent, frequency and duration of lake water level fluctuations (WLF) are dominant forces controlling the functioning of lake ecosystems, especially in the lake's littoral and aquatic-terrestrial interface processes. In East Dongting Lake, Carex life history synchronize the arrival of overwintering birds, Carex meadow provide vital wintering ground for migratory waterbirds, especially for the Lesser White-fronted Geese. However, significant changes had taken place in the hydrological regime of East Dongting Lake and our research showed it caused chiefly by sediment deposition in the lake basin and the replenishment of the Three Gorges Dam. The annual lowest water level of the East Dongting Lake had gradually risen and the annual water level amplitude had decreased obviously over the past 60 years. Since the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, the average water level increased significantly from January to June. The Three Gorges Dam holder the incoming water from late September to late October that the status will change from flood control limited water level to normal water level, meanwhile the water level of East Dongting Lake declined significantly through the same duration, especially in October. The operation of the Three Gorges Dam decreased flooding days in the areas above 22-m elevation, resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation-covered area and synchronous downward movement of vegetation distribution pattern. As the timing of water level recession at elevations of 24\u201327\u2009m were 12, 17, 19 and 16 days earlier than that in 1981\u20132002, the optimum elevation for Carex growth decreased from 25\u201326\u2009m to 24\u201325\u2009m.

These datasets showed that TWSA in the Garonne basin is mainly due to water stored in the first dozen meters of soil and in the shallow aquifer. To a smaller extent, snow also influences Garonne TWSA. Open surface water TWSA is quite small and TWSA from deep aquifer is negligible. The most important drought period occurred in 2011/2012, due to low precipitation during the two hydrological years and ETR close to previous years. Important precipitation in 2013/2014 helps to refill the water stocks. This study also showed that GRACE and models mismatches should be due to GRACE poor spatial resolution, but also to its monthly time resolution (rarely shown in previous studies)."}{"Facing a future water resources management crisis in sub-Saharan Africa ": "Study region\n                  Sub-Saharan Africa.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  Water resources availability assessments are highly uncertain due to inadequate observation networks, and this is expected to get worse into the future.

The rate of silicate weathering is dependent on an overall balance of key factors including gradient, contact time, temperature and vegetation. The higher concentration of cations was balanced by the SO4 originating from the action of H2SO4 and H2CO3 on carbonates and silicates.

Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as one of the enabling technologies for a smart grid network. As the IoT connected devices continue to grow at a rapid pace, one of the major challenges is security since the devices are online hence making the smart grid vulnerable to significant attacks. Since an IoT based smart grid would consist of potentially millions of nodes, it has the largest attack surface for an IoT focused cyber-attack. A cyber-attack on a smart grid would have devastating effects on reliability of widespread infrastructure given the potential cascade effects of shutting down the electricity grid since most of the devices in our homes, offices, hospitals and trains require electricity to run. Once a single device is compromised, then the whole grid becomes vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such attacks on electricity supply can grind entire cities to a halt thereby causing huge financial and economic losses. This makes security a critical factor to consider before large scale deployment of IoT based smart grid networks.\n                  In this paper we review and explore the major challenges and security issues stunting the growth of IoT-based smart grid networks."}{"Complex approach to assessing resilience of critical infrastructure elements ": "The resilience of elements in a critical infrastructure system is a major factor determining the reliability of services and commodities provided by the critical infrastructure system to society. Resilience can be viewed as a quality which reduces the vulnerability of an element, absorbs the effects of disruptive events, enhances the element's ability to respond and recover, and facilitates its adaptation to disruptive events similar to those encountered in the past. In this respect, resilience assessment plays an important role in ensuring the security and reliability of not only these elements alone, but also of the system as a whole. The paper introduces the CIERA methodology designed for Critical Infrastructure Elements Resilience Assessment. The principle of this method is the statistical assessment of the level of resilience of critical infrastructure elements, involving a complex evaluation of their robustness, their ability to recover functionality after the occurrence of a disruptive event and their capacity to adapt to previous disruptive events. The complex approach thus includes both the assessment of technical and organizational resilience, as well as the identification of weak points in order to strengthen resilience. An example of the application of the CIERA method is presented in the form of a case study focused on assessing the resilience of a selected element of electrical energy infrastructure."}{"\u201cInternet of Smart Cards\u201d: A pocket attacks scenario ": "Smart cards are secure devices used to store people sensitive data and to regulate important operations like identity proofs and payment transactions. For years people have been used to contact smart cards but in the last decade we have seen the massive introduction of contactless smart cards. At the same time we have seen a growing number of mobile phones equipped with a NFC interface in circulation, which are capable of interacting with contactless smart cards.\n                  Under different circumstances the user\u2019s contactless cards and mobile phone are kept close together at a distance that should enable them to interact each other, for instance in pockets and bags. We describe an architecture to attack the contactless cards of a user through his NFC-equipped mobile phone. The user\u2019s mobile phone, here defined as smart-mole, is infected and connected to the NFC-equipped one of the attacker, the proxy. The victim\u2019s phone capabilities are exploited to run local attacks against a contactless card in its range, for instance to recover the card PIN that is then sent back to the attacker. Subsequently the attacker remotely uses the victim\u2019s card through a relay attack putting his phone in front of a reader and providing the PIN of the victim card when needed, basically impersonating the cardholder. Infecting several phones an attacker could have under his control a large set of cards, a sort of \u201cInternet of Smart Cards\u201d.\n                  We show that surveying a decade of research and development in the contactless cards field such attacks look feasible according the current social context and the level of technology.

Interrupting these industries could lead to disastrous consequences, leading to financial losses or even costing human lives. For that reason, researchers have been actively investigating the threats targeting ICS. In this paper, the authors propose a mechanism of attack detection and mitigation for attacks focusing on the input memory of Programming Logic Controllers (PLCs). To help investigate this concept, a testbed that models a clean water supply system was built using components and technologies currently used in the industry. The mechanism supporting attack detection and response for the input memory is implemented within the PLC itself as part of its programming. The mechanism of response involves three different techniques: optimised datablocks, switching between control strategies and obtaining the sensor readings directly from its analogue channel. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach along with the effectiveness of each response mechanism."}{"A framework for modeling and assessing system resilience using a Bayesian network: A case study of an interdependent electrical infrastructure system ": "This research utilizes Bayesian network to address a range of possible risks to the electrical power system and its interdependent networks (EIN) and offers possible options to mitigate the consequences of a disruption. The interdependent electrical infrastructure system in Washington, D.C. is used as a case study to quantify the resilience using the Bayesian network. Quantification of resilience is further analyzed based on different types of analysis such as forward propagation, backward propagation, sensitivity analysis, and information theory. The general insight drawn from these analyses indicate that reliability, backup power source, and resource restoration are the prime factors contributed towards enhancing the resilience of an interdependent electrical infrastructure system."}{"Extending the cyber-attack landscape for SCADA-based critical infrastructure ": "The move from point-to-point serial communication to traditional information technology (IT) networks has created new challenges in providing cyber-security for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in critical infrastructure. Current research on the attack landscape for critical infrastructure concentrates on either IT-based or protocol specific attacks. However, there is limited research focus on \u201cthe bigger picture\u201d, the combination of IT attacks and critical infrastructure protocol attacks, and little consideration of cyber-attacks targeting an entire (SCADA)-based critical infrastructure system. Due to such narrow research, there is a complete lack of focus when comprehending full-scale cyber attacks on SCADA-based critical infrastructure systems. As a result, new attacks combining various vulnerabilities in engineering systems and IT systems are yet to be discovered.\n                  In this paper, we collated existing known attacks, identified and combined the existing range of attack landscapes, expanded and \u201cfilled the gaps\u201d in the landscape, thus presenting a complete cyber-attack framework that perceives attacks against entire SCADA-based critical infrastructure. Our framework identifies four attack types, traditional IT-based attacks, protocol specific attacks, configuration-based attacks and control process attacks, allowing us to describe practical attacks. The benefit of recognizing the range of attacks on entire critical systems is that it allows us to defend against attacks with far greater efficiency and intelligence. To support the validity of our presented framework, we present a case study demonstrating a series of attacks on physical Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) critical infrastructure equipment."}{"Quality function deployment-based framework for improving the resilience of critical infrastructure systems ": "Critical infrastructure systems (CISs), increasingly suffering from various hazards in recent decades, are in urgent need of improving their resilience. So far few approaches for CISs resilience improvement have recognized that different resilience improvement efforts could have synergetic or conflicting correlations between them. There lack systemic approaches for transforming resilience improvement requirements into coordinated and implementable measures. To address this gap, the current study proposes a quality function deployment (QFD)-based framework for strengthening the resilience of CISs. The proposed framework involves different stages of the CISs lifecycle, and takes into consideration the correlations between resilience improvement efforts at these stages. It can transform resilience criteria into system properties, component characteristics, implementation processes and controlling factors successively, which is facilitated with a series of houses of quality (HoQs). Using a case study of electric power system, we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed framework with detailed explanations of the design and implementation of the first HoQ. The results of the case study showed that the proposed framework could identify the trade-offs between resilience improvement efforts at different stages of the CISs lifecycle, and take into account their relationships with resilience criteria and the correlations among them to work out optimized solutions for improved CISs resilience."}{"Cyber attack detection and mitigation: Software Defined Survivable Industrial Control Systems ": "Modern Industrial Control Systems (ICS) constitute complex and heterogeneous \u2018system of systems\u2019 embracing the numerous advantages of traditional Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The pervasive integration of off-the-shelf ICT into the core of ICS broadened the palette of features and applications, but it also raised new design challenges and exposed ICS to a new breed of cyber-physical attacks. In addition, despite all the security solutions in place, unavoidably, these systems may be compromised. Therefore, survivability, that is, the ability to face malicious actions and faults, becomes a salient feature/requirement in the design of modern cyber-connected ICS. We present a comprehensive solution for ensuring the survival of ICS under malicious activities and faults. We design a Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) based communication infrastructure particularly tailored to address the communication requirements of ICS. We develop an attack detection and localization algorithm for bidirectional ICS flows, and we design an optimal intervention strategy that embraces the communication and security requirements of industrial applications. Finally, we present intrinsic details on recreating a real-life and emulated test infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the solution\u2019s applicability to networked robot control systems."}{"Modelling the long-term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond performance in an urban catchment ": "The influence of long-term suspended sediment dynamics on stormwater pond performance should not be ignored, but is often neglected in pond design and performance evaluation. This paper provides systematic simulated quantification of long-term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond performance. Integrated hydrological and two-dimensional hydro-morphodynamic modelling and simulations were carried over a 32-year period (1984\u20132015) covering 3896 rainfall events with a wide range of rainfall volumes, durations and intensities. Three event-based hypothetical rainfall scenarios: non-flood condition (5-year), sewer design condition (30-year), and river flood condition (100-year) rainfall events with 1-h duration, were also simulated for comparison between the traditional event-based approach and the novel approach presented in this study. Simulation results show that the flood peak attenuation and delay are more pronounced for small (<5-year) and medium (<30-year) flood events. The long-term continuous simulation results indicate that the pond provides positive annual trap efficiencies varying from 2% to 69% for 31 of 32\u202fyears, providing long-term water quality benefits downstream. However, an extreme rainfall event in year 2012 flush out the accumulated sedimentation as a shock load to the downstream river, leading to a negative trap efficiency of \u221211%. The spatially averaged sediment deposition rate, as predicted by the model, varies with a mean (SD) of 2 (1.34)\u202fcm/year over the study period, which resulted in a 24% loss in the pond\u2019s volume over 32\u202fyears. The impact of the loss in storage on pond flood attenuation capacity are explored at regular time intervals over the study period. The results indicate that reduction in the pond\u2019s flood attenuation capacity is relatively more pronounced for medium (30-year) and extreme (100-year) flood events than the frequent small flood (5-year) events. The variation in annual sediment loading with rainfall quantities and patterns are also explored."}{"Water diplomacy: The intersect of science, policy and practice ": "Why water diplomacy? What does diplomacy have to do with water? Is cooperation over transboundary surface and ground waters the exclusive domain of diplomats and foreign policy experts? Or mainly the purview of water professionals negotiating agreements on shared water resources? Why should non-governmental stakeholders be involved in transboundary water dialogues? These questions lie at the heart of debates and dialogues around the theory and practice of water diplomacy.\n                  The main aim of this Special Issue is to elaborate the intersect of science, policy, and practice and discuss ways knowledge can be distributed more equally and bridged across these spheres. In this editorial article, we summarize key messages on water diplomacy brought forward by authors in this Special Issue. We have identified the trends below as a possible future direction on water diplomacy research as well as issues that need to be addressed in the policy debate. One of the overarching themes is how to ensure that available technical knowledge informs the political tracks of water diplomacy and how to build trust effectively to ensure sustainability of water cooperation processes."}{"Circular use of plastics-transformation of existing petrochemical clusters into thermochemical recycling plants with 100% plastics recovery ": "Plastics represent a serious waste-handling problem, with only 10% of the plastic waste (PW) generated world-wide being recycled. The remainder follows a linear economy model, involving disposal or incineration. Thermochemical recycling provides an opportunity to close the material cycle, and this work shows how this can be achieved using the existing petrochemical infrastructure. The transformation of a generic petrochemical cluster based on virgin fossil feedstocks into a cluster that is based on PW has the following proposed sequence: (1) the feedstock is partially replaced (45% on carbon basis) by PW; (2) the feedstock is totally replaced by PW; (3) the process undergoes electrification; and (4) oxy-combustion and carbon capture and storage are introduced to achieve 100% carbon recovery in the form of monomers or permanent storage. An alternative transformation pathway that includes the introduction of biomass is also considered. The energy and carbon balances of the proposed implementation steps are resolved, and cost estimates of the savings related to the feedstock and required investments are presented. The main conclusion drawn is that switching the feedstock from virgin fossil fuels to PW (Implementation steps 1 and 2) confers economic advantages. However, the subsequent transformation steps (Implementation steps 3 and 4) can only be justified if a value is assigned to the environmental benefits, e.g., CO2 savings, increased share of biogenic carbon in plastic products, increasing recycling quotas, and/or the potential of the process to compensate for the intermittency of renewable power. It is also discussed how utilisation of the diverse compositions of PW streams by additional processes can meet the other demands of a chemical cluster."}{"Characterisation and properties of visible light-active bismuth oxide-titania composite photocatalysts ": "Bismuth oxide \u2013 titanium dioxide composite materials were produced by pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering onto two types of commercially available titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The use of an oscillating bowl enabled deposition of bismuth oxide uniformly onto loose powders, in contrast to solid substrates typically used for the conventional magnetron sputtering processes. Variation of the deposition time allowed the production of composite materials with different amounts of bismuth oxide. The composite materials, as well as uncoated titania powders, were extensively analysed by a range of analytical techniques, including SEM/EDX, XRD, BET, XPS, TEM and UV\u2013visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Photocatalytic properties of the materials were assessed under simulated visible light irradiation via degradation of acetone and methanol through measurements of carbon dioxide evolution. Additionally, the composite materials were characterised with a newly developed technique of reversed double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy in order to obtain information on the distribution of electron traps. Bismuth oxide was found in crystalline \u03b2-Bi2O3 form on both types of substrates without any additional heat treatment applied. Though the distribution of bismuth oxide on titanium dioxide was found to depend strongly on particle size and deposition time used, the composite materials exhibited significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity compared to either of the commercial titania materials used as a substrate."}{"Recent advances in high energy-density cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries ": "Large-scale energy storage technologies are in great demands for the enhanced power grid efficiency and wide renewable energy source applications. Various electrochemical energy storage devices, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) et al. with long operating life and high energy conversion efficiency, have achieved rapid growth in the past 30\u202fyears, which make them the best choice for the large energy storage applications. Recently, SIBs have been proposed as the most promising solution for the large-scale energy storage systems because of the huge abundant and low cost of sodium resources. High energy-density cathode materials are now the main limits for high performance SIBs. Herein, the advances made in high energy-density cathodes for SIBs, together with the sodium storage mechanism; the remaining challenges and perspectives for high energy-density cathode materials, are discussed thoroughly based on recent researches and publications. Meanwhile, the achievement of material simulations in the design and development of cathode materials for SIBs, especially the high-throughput strategy and data science, is also introduced. This review is expected to accelerate the progress on SIB studies for high energy-density cathode materials, and more importantly, open up new opportunities for the high-energy cathode materials design in sodium storage."}{"Aqueous solution discharge of cylindrical lithium-ion cells ": "The development of mass-market electric vehicles (EVs) using lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is helping to propel growth in LIB usage, but end-of-life strategies for LIBs are not well developed. An important aspect of waste LIB processing is the stabilisation of such high energy-density devices, and energy discharge is an obvious way to achieve this. Salt-water electrochemical discharge is often mentioned as the initial step in many LIB recycling studies, but the details of the process itself have not often been mentioned. This study presents systematic discharge characteristics of different saline and basic solutions using identical, fully charged LIB cells. A total of 26 different ionic solutes with sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and ammonium (NH4\n                     +) cations have been tested here using a fixed weight percentage concentration. An evaluation of possible reactions has also been carried out here. The results show good discharge for many of the salts, without significant damaging visual corrosion. The halide salts (Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212) show rapid corrosion of the positive terminal, as does sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3), and the solution penetrates the cell can. Mildly acidic solutions do not appear to cause significant damage to the cell can. The most alkaline solutions (NaOH and K3PO4) appear to penetrate the cell without any clear visual damage at the terminals. Depending on what is desired by the discharge (i.e. complete cell destruction and stabilisation or potential re-use or materials recovery), discharge of individual Li-ion cells using aqueous solutions holds clear promise for scaled-up and safe industrial processes."}{"Research gaps in environmental life cycle assessments of lithium ion batteries for grid-scale stationary energy storage systems: End-of-life options and other issues ": "Although deployments of grid-scale stationary lithium ion battery energy storage systems are accelerating, the environmental impacts of this new infrastructure class are not well studied. To date, a small literature of environmental life cycle assessments (LCAs) and related studies has examined associated environmental impacts, but they rely on a variety of methods and system boundaries rather than a consistent approach. The large LCA literature of transportation applications of LIB contains selected life-cycle inventory data relevant for stationary ESSs, but does not incorporate characteristics unique to stationary systems, such as balance of system materials; operational profiles; and perhaps even different end-of-life (EOL) phase needs. This critical literature review surveys the existing studies on grid-scale stationary LIB ESS, and highlights research gaps concerning comprehensive environmental impacts. Further analysis specific to grid-connected LIB systems \u2013 encompassing use phase (battery operation) and EOL, in addition to production phase \u2013 is required for a robust assessment of environmental impacts of grid-connected energy storage in LIB systems. For example, thus far studies that systematically evaluate the consequential impact of storage system operation have been focused on energy arbitrage and frequency regulation applications. Future work should consider the impact of ESS providing other grid services as well. Although EOL costs and impacts for stationary LIB ESSs are an important consideration for prospective asset owners and key users of grid-scale ESS (such as electric utility companies and project developers), they are not yet addressed in the literature."}{"Alkali-activated soapstone waste - Mechanical properties, durability, and economic prospects ": "Soapstone is a soft, magnesium-rich mineral widely used in the production of carved objects and architectural elements, for instance. The processing of soapstone causes the formation of significant amounts of waste powder, which is largely landfilled at the moment. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the suitability of soapstone waste as the main binder for the alkali-activation process using sodium silicate and hydroxide solutions as activators. The results demonstrate that soapstone alone reacts to some extent (compressive strength of 13\u202fMPa at 28\u202fday age), but mechanical properties are improved significantly after replacing 20% of soapstone by metakaolin (compressive strength of 31\u202fMPa at 28 d age). The obtained mechanical properties are closely similar to those of virgin soapstone. Durability properties of the developed alkali-activated binders were similar or better than typical Portland cement-based binders in terms of high temperature, acid, and freeze-thaw resistance, and sorptivity. The material costs alkali-activated soapstone mortar were estimated as approximately 70 \u20ac/t. Thus, the results enable utilizing currently underexploited soapstone waste in a sustainable and economically interesting way."}{"Solid polymer electrolytes based on lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide/poly(vinylidene fluoride -co-hexafluoropropylene) for safer rechargeable lithium-ion batteries ": "The increasing use of electronic portable systems and the consequent energy demand, leads to the need to improve energy storage systems. According to that and due to safety issues, high-performance non-flammable electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) are needed.\n                  SPE containing different amounts of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), PVDF-HFP, polymer matrix have been prepared by solvent casting. The addition of LiTFSI into PVDF-HFP allows to tailor thermal, mechanical and electrical properties of the composite.\n                  In particular, the ionic conductivity of the composites increases with LiTFSI content, the best ionic conductivities of 0.0011\u202fmS/cm at 25\u202f\u00b0C and 0.23\u202fmS/cm at 90\u202f\u00b0C were obtained for the PVDF-HFP/LiTFSI composites with 80\u202fwt% of LiTFSI.\n                  This solid electrolyte allows the fabrication of Li metallic/SPE/C-LiFePO4 half-cells with a discharge capacity of 51.2\u202fmAh/g at C/20. Further, theoretical simulations show that the discharge capacity value depends on the lithium concentration and percentage of free ions and is independent of the solid polymer electrolyte thickness. On the other hand, the voltage plateau depends on the SPE thickness. Thus, a solid electrolyte is presented for the next generation of safer solid-state batteries."}{"The formation and effect of defect dipoles in lead-free piezoelectric ceramics: A review ": "As one of the most crucial intrinsic contributions, defect dipoles show unique and prominent influence on the responsive behavior of piezoelectric ceramics. Here, we present the formation of the defect dipoles and the state-of-the-art effect on lead-free piezoelectric ceramics in detail. First, the formation of defect dipoles in ceramics are demonstrated. The coupling effect between defect dipole polarization and normal ferroelectric spontaneous polarization, which results in the unusual ferroelectric properties (e.g., \u201cpinched\u201d or asymmetric polarization hysteresis loops) and high electric field induced-strain performance in piezoelectric ceramics, is elaborated. Thereafter, we systematically introduce the switching and decoupling process of defect dipoles under different external conditions. Finally, the researches about the effect of defect dipoles on various lead-free piezoelectric ceramics are presented herein, with special attention on the three systems: the barium titanate, sodium-bismuth titanate and potassium sodium niobate. The remaining challenges, however, such as weak temperature/cycling stability, still need further effort for the extensive applications of these materials."}{"Thermal insulation materials based on agricultural residual wheat straw and corn husk biomass, for application in sustainable buildings ": "The high energy consumption in buildings is a major contributor to climate change and atmospheric pollution in south cities of Chile. In this context, insulation materials are a key factor to reduce the energy demand during the operational stage of a building. These materials are however commonly fabricated from petrochemicals with high energy consumption, causing significant detrimental effects on the environment during the production and discarding stage. Due these reasons, insulation materials based on natural fibers waste appear as an excellent alternative, due to abundant availability in south regions of Chile, potential low cost, low energy consumption during the production stage and high bio-degradation rate at the end of life. In this research, block type insulation based on wheat straw and corn husk residual fibers were developed. Taguchi method was applied to investigate the effect on thermal conductivity and density of four control factors in three levels, namely fiber length, boiling time; NaOH concentration and blending time; in a L-9 orthogonal array. Furthermore, flexural and compressive stress were determined and compared with expanded polystyrene block insulation. The results show thermal conductivity values were between 0.046 and 0.047\u202fW/mK. In addition, flexural stress results were good compared to those of the standard expanded polystyrene type IX. Finally, optimum conditions of the process were determined to obtain a final block, which was morphologically analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while the thermal behavior was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)."}{"Gold nanoparticle based photothermal therapy: Development and application for effective cancer treatment ": "Recent advances in nanomedicine make it auspicious for cancer diagnosis and treatment. A possible non-invasive photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancer treatment could be constructed by combining the nanomedicine and laser. PTT employs photothermal agents (PTAs) with high photothermal conversion efficacy for converting light into heat to selectively kill cancer cells under the help of lasers. Because of the unique Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) phenomenon and the tunable near-infrared (NIR) region absorption, noble metal nanoparticles like gold nanoparticles can be applied as a PTA for PTT. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) offer the enhanced absorption and scattering properties, the optical properties tunability, and specific tumor targeting capability, therefore, AuNPs based PTT turns to be furthermore promising. However, drawbacks such as long retention time, cytotoxicity, and insufficient cancer cells targeting restrict the application of AuNPs as PTTs. This review overviews research of the PTT applications of various modified AuNPs in previous publications. With the advancement of chemical synthesis technology, AuNPs of various shapes and sizes can be synthesized with desired properties, which can achieve multimodal cancer treatment with enhanced anti- tumor effect. In this review, we summarized the major features of five principal types of AuNPs: gold nanorods, gold nanoshells, gold nanospheres, gold nanocages, and gold nanostars with different sizes, discussed their advantages and disadvantages in PTT. We also detailed the surface modification of AuNPs which could be beneficial for the performance of AuNPs based PTT. In addition, depending on properties of AuNPs and lasers, the underlying mechanism of cell death triggered by NIR laser can be different, which also affects the anti-cancer effects and outcomes of PTT. However, controlling cell death through a desired cell death mechanism to achieve desired PTT outcome is still a challenge."}{"The contribution of Halliday to EAP writing instruction: A personal journey ": "Halliday's work on the texture of texts and thematic structure is fundamental in enabling EAP students to follow the advice often given by lecturers to \u2018write clearly and logically\u2019. An understanding of thematic structure can equip students with the tools to construct paragraphs that communicate their own ideas in ways that are easy to read. This approach takes students beyond topic sentences and discourse markers to a more nuanced presentation of their arguments. In this researching EAP practice paper, I will trace the coverage of Theme and thematic structure in the research literature, in handbooks for teachers and in coursebooks for students, which influenced my own use of these concepts. I will show how these concepts were incorporated into teaching materials to help EAP students write effective paragraphs."}{"EL1 and EL2 doctoral students\u2019 experience in writing the discussion section: A needs analysis ": "This article reports on a micro-level needs analysis of thesis discussion writing. An anonymised digital survey collected information from 295 doctoral candidates about their self-defined learning needs for thesis discussion writing. Participant variables include English language background (English First Language (EL1) speakers and English as an Additional or Second Language (EL2) speakers), discipline (Hard pure & Soft pure, Engineering, and Education), writing stage (early, mid, and final), and type of research methods (experiments, case studies, simulations, etc.). Findings reveal significant differences in students' perceptions of challenges and the genre conventions along these factors. The analysis also shows students\u2019 high expectations for the specificity and depth of support that they would like. Theoretically, the findings add to what is known about the challenges in EL1 and EL2 doctoral discussion writing. Pedagogically, they offer insights for supervisors and future students. We conclude the paper with some implications for future study into the teaching of thesis writing and doctoral supervision."}{"The use of humour in teaching and learning in higher education classrooms: Lecturers\u2019 perspectives ": "University lecturers' perspectives on the use of humour in teaching and learning have received little attention in the humour and higher education literature. Humour serves many roles in teaching and learning, and university lecturers' use of humour is both strategic and pedagogical in facilitating teaching. This paper explores the different types of humour that lecturers use in relation to three dominant theories of humour: the superiority, incongruity and relief theories. Intended and spontaneous humour and the various types of humour utilised to facilitate teaching and learning in the classroom are emphasised. Data for this study were collected by observing the classroom teaching of five award-winning lecturers in a university in New Zealand, who were identified and nominated by students as having a good sense of humour in the classroom. These lecturers were observed while teaching and then interviewed using Stimulated Recall Interviews (SRI) to understand their reflections-in-action concerning specific humorous moments and specific humorous behaviours while teaching. The data indicates that seven types of humour were used, either intentionally or spontaneously, to enhance student learning or to engage students' attention. These insights provide a fresh viewpoint on the use of humour from lecturers\u2019 perspectives."}{"\n               With the rapid development: A contrastive analysis of lexical bundles in dissertation abstracts by Chinese and L1 English doctoral students ": "This study compared the use of lexical bundles in dissertation abstracts written in English by Chinese and L1 English doctoral students. Our data consisted of 13,596 and 4,755 abstracts of doctoral dissertations written by Chinese students at Tsinghua University (the Tsinghua Corpus) and L1 English students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (the MIT Corpus), respectively. With a combination of frequency and dispersion criteria, 165 and 134 four-word bundles were identified from the Tsinghua Corpus and the MIT Corpus, respectively. These bundles were categorized structurally and functionally. Results revealed substantial differences in the frequencies with which bundles of different structural and functional categories were used by Chinese and L1 English students, as well as in the specific types of bundles of different categories they used. A close analysis of these differences revealed that Chinese students exhibited incomplete knowledge of some aspects of the English lexico-grammatical system, signs of transfer of Chinese language features and discourse conventions, and insufficient awareness of bundles characteristic of hard science disciplines."}{"\u2018Can you talk me through your argument\u2019? Features of dialogic interaction in academic writing tutorials ": "Academic writing tutorials are regarded as beneficial when they are conducted in an egalitarian and dialogic mode of interaction, enabling students to negotiate and explore ideas. However, previous research has revealed a tendency towards tutor dominance and prescriptive, monologic teaching behaviour. The research presented in this article explored the nature of interaction and instructional talk in tutorials delivered by peer tutors. The peer-tutoring model is often chosen to facilitate discipline-specific advice; however, peer tutors may not always be sufficiently experienced and trained to deliver dialogic teaching. This study examined ten peer-led tutorials with the aim to make evidence-based recommendations for tutor training. The initial quantitative analysis led to the identification of the two most dialogic and the two most monologic tutorials, which were subsequently subjected to a detailed discourse analysis. The findings show an overall high degree of tutor-dominated interaction. In the few dialogic tutorials, however, the tutors' skilful use of initiating and follow-up moves and frequent use of scaffolding techniques helped the students to engage more deeply with their topic and solve problems independently . The findings suggest that tutor training should focus more explicitly on the benefits, features and strategies of a dialogic tutoring approach."}{"The development of cognitive academic language proficiency in multilingual education: Evidence of a longitudinal study on the language of history ": ""}{"Do native writers always have a head start over nonnative writers? The use of lexical bundles in college students\u2019 essays ": "Formulaic language is widely used in academic prose and is known to be a useful measure of various aspects of language development. Prior studies have reported that L2 novice/student writers rely on formulaic language typical of conversation more than L1 academic writers do. However, these studies compared different types of academic writing, and thus do not clarify whether the L2 patterns they found are attributable to register or to characteristics of L2 writers, or both. The present study addresses this gap by examining the use of frequently recurring word sequences (lexical bundles) with comparable corpora of L1 and L2 novice academic writing, strictly matched for register and writing prompts. The study identified lexical bundles in the corpora, and analyzed these bundles\u2019 structures and functions. The findings suggest that the two groups display many common features in the use of bundles, including heavy use of VP-based bundles, stance-expression bundles, idiomatic PP bundles, and informal quantifying bundles, all of which have been described in previous work as unique features of learner LB use. The findings are informative regarding the extent to which native and nonnative students enter college equipped with knowledge of formulaic language appropriate to academic writing."}{"The futures of EAP genre studies: A personal viewpoint ": "This argumentative essay opens with the suggestion that EAP genre analysts and practitioners may legitimately differ with regard to the appropriate size and extent of genres. It then argues that certain recent popular topics in genre studies have been overdone, and then goes on to suggest and illustrate areas that could be more fruitfully investigated. It closes with a discussion of whether EAP studies remain \u2018too textual\u2019 and how greater attention to contextual factors and influences might be obtained."}{"Effect of an EAP unit on EFL student effective and appropriate source-use skills ": "It is widely believed source-use skills are among the most important academic literacy skills that students need to develop throughout their college years. Although there has been extensive discussion of the difficulties experienced by ESL/EFL students developing these skills, few studies have focused on instructional interventions designed specifically to build source-use skills. To the best of our knowledge, no intervention recorded in the literature has focused on both essential aspects of source use \u2014 effective as well as appropriate source use at the same time. In this classroom-based study, we investigated whether a source-use oriented EAP unit can markedly improve student source-use skills. Results showed that the EAP unit led to significant improvement in three out of the four operations under source-use effectiveness, that is, using sources for giving support to an argument, establishing links among sources, and integrating source texts into one's own writing; the EAP unit led to significant improvement in all three operations under source-use appropriateness, namely, adequate attribution to source authors, accurate representation of source ideas, and substantial transformation of source language. A number of pedagogical implications were drawn from this study."}{"Source area management practices as remediation tool to address groundwater nitrate pollution in drinking supply wells ": "Nitrate in drinking water may cause serious health problems for consumers. Agricultural activities are known to be the main source of groundwater nitrate contaminating rural domestic and urban public water supply wells in farming regions. Management practices have been proposed to reduce the amount of nitrate in groundwater, including improved nutrient management practices and \u201cpump and fertilize\u201d with nitrate-affected irrigation wells. Here, we evaluate the feasibility and long-term impacts of agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) in the source area of public water supply wells. A numerical model of nitrate fate and transport was developed for the Modesto basin, part of California's Central Valley aquifer system. The basin is representative of semi-arid agricultural regions around the world with a diversity of crop types, overlying an unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system. A local public supply well in an economically disadvantaged community surrounded by farmland was the focus of this study. Model scenarios implemented include business as usual, alternative low-impact crops, and Ag-MAR in the source area of the public supply well. Alternative nutrient management and recharge practices act as remediation tools in the area between farmland and the public supply well. Improved agricultural source area management practices are shown to be an effective tool to maintain or even enhance groundwater quality in the targeted supply well while remediating ambient groundwater.\n                  Best results are obtained when lowering nitrate load while also increasing recharge in the source area simultaneously. This scenario reduced nitrate in the supply well's drinking water by 80% relative to the business as usual scenario. It also remediated ambient groundwater used by domestic wells between the source area farmlands and the supply well and showed 60% more reduction of nitrate after 60\u202fyears of application. Increasing recharge led to shorter initial response time (five years) and showed the most sustainable impact. Our analysis further suggests that Ag-MAR in a highly discontinuous, wide-spread pattern leads to slow water quality response and may not yield sufficient water quality improvements."}{"Groundwater flow velocities in a fractured carbonate aquifer-type: Implications for contaminant transport ": "Contaminants that are highly soluble in groundwater are rapidly transported via fractures in mechanically resistant sedimentary rock aquifers. Hence, a rigorous methodology is needed to estimate groundwater flow velocities in such fractured aquifers. Here, we propose an approach using borehole hydraulic testing to compute flow velocities in an un-faulted area of a fractured carbonate aquifer by applying the cubic law to a parallel plate model. The Cadeby Formation (Yorkshire, NE England) \u2013 a Permian dolostone aquifer present beneath the University of Leeds Farm - is the fractured aquifer selected for this hydraulic experiment.\n                  The bedding plane fractures of this dolostone aquifer, which are sub-horizontal, sub-parallel and laterally persistent, largely dominate the flow at shallow (<~40 mBGL) depths. These flowing bedding plane discontinuities are separated by a rock matrix which is relatively impermeable (K\n                     \n                        well-test\n                     /K\n                     \n                        core-plug\n                     ~104) as is common in fractured carbonate aquifers.\n                  In the workflow reported here, the number of flowing fractures - mainly bedding plane fractures - intersecting three open monitoring wells are found from temperature/fluid conductivity and acoustic/optical televiewer logging. Following well installation, average fracture hydraulic apertures for screened intervals are found from analysis of slug tests. For the case study aquifer, this workflow predicts hydraulic apertures ranging from 0.10 up to 0.54\u202fmm. However, groundwater flow velocities range within two order of magnitude from 13 up to 242\u202fm/day.\n                  Notably, fracture apertures and flow velocities rapidly reduce with increasing depth below the water table; the upper ~10\u202fm shows relatively high values of hydraulic conductivity (0.30\u20132.85\u202fm/day) and corresponding flow velocity (33\u2013242\u202fm/day). Permeability development around the water table in carbonate aquifer-types is common, and arises where high pCO2 recharge water from the soil zone causes calcite/dolomite dissolution. Hence, agricultural contaminants entering the aquifer with recharge water are laterally transported rapidly within this upper part.\n                  Computation of groundwater flow velocities allows determination of the Reynolds number. Values of up ~1, indicating the lower limit of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, are found at the studied site, which is situated away from major fault traces. Hence, turbulent flow is likely to arise in proximity to tectonic structures, such as normal faults, which localize flow and enhance karstification. The occurrence of turbulent flow in correspondence of such tectonic structures should be represented in regional groundwater flow simulations."}{"Do CSIA data from aquifers inform on natural degradation of chlorinated ethenes in aquitards? ": "Back-diffusion of chlorinated ethenes (CEs) from low-permeability layers (LPLs) causes contaminant persistence long after the primary spill zones have disappeared. Naturally occurring degradation in LPLs lowers remediation time frames, but its assessment through sediment sampling is prohibitive in conventional remediation projects. Scenario simulations were performed with a reactive transport model (PHT3D in FloPy) accounting for isotope effects associated with degradation, sorption, and diffusion, to evaluate the potential of CSIA data from aquifers in assessing degradation in aquitards. The model simulated a trichloroethylene (TCE) DNAPL and its pollution plume within an aquifer-aquitard-aquifer system. Sequential reductive dechlorination to ethene and sorption were uniform in the aquitard and did not occur in the aquifer. After 10\u202fyears of loading the aquitard through diffusion from the plume, subsequent source removal triggered release of TCE by back-diffusion. In the upper aquifer, during the loading phase, \u03b413C-TCE was slightly enriched (up to 2\u2030) due to diffusion effects stimulated by degradation in the aquitard. In the upper aquifer, during the release phase, (i) source removal triggered a huge \u03b413C increase especially for higher CEs, (ii) moreover, downstream decreasing isotope ratios (caused by downgradient later onset of the release phase) with temporal increasing isotope ratios reflect aquitard degradation (as opposed to downstream increasing and temporally constant isotope ratios in reactive aquifers), and (iii) the carbon isotope mass balance (CIMB) enriched up to 4\u2030 as lower CEs (more depleted, less sorbing) have been transported deeper into the aquitard. Thus, enriched CIMB does not indicate oxidative transformation in this system. The CIMB enrichment enhanced with more sorption and lower aquitard thickness. Thin aquitards are quicker flushed from lower CEs leading to faster CIMB enrichment over time. CIMB enrichment is smaller or nearly absent when daughter products accumulate. Aquifer CSIA patterns indicative of aquitard degradation were similar in case of linear decreasing rate constants but contrasted with previous simulations assuming a thin bioactive zone. The Rayleigh equation systematically underestimates the extent of TCE degradation in aquifer samples especially during the loading phase and for conditions leading to long remediation time frames (low groundwater flow velocity, thicker aquitards, strong sorption in the aquitard). The Rayleigh equation provides a good and useful picture on aquitard degradation during the release phase throughout the sensitivity analysis. This modelling study provides a framework on how aquifer CSIA data can inform on the occurrence of aquitard degradation and its pitfalls."}{"Acid mine drainage sources and hydrogeochemistry at the Yatani mine, Yamagata, Japan: A geochemical and isotopic study ": "This paper describes the geochemistry of groundwater and its flow system in the closed Yatani mine in southern Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. The mine is located in a sulfide deposit containing pyrite and has been generating acid mine drainage (AMD). The study was intended to elucidate the formation of AMD and its flow patterns using geological, hydrological, geochemical, and isotopic techniques. The results indicate that AMD is formed by the interaction of groundwater with sulfide minerals, sand slime, and tailings back-filled into excavated mine areas. Groundwater recharge areas were identified on the mountain slope at an elevation of ~900\u202fm. The formation of AMD in the drifts and shaft was more extensive than that in the deeper drainage levels. Principal component analysis was applied to the hydrogeochemical data to identify the causes of AMD formation. The first, second, and third principal components reveal that the increased ion concentrations in mine drainage are a result of water\u2013mineral reactions in excavated mine areas, the contribution of groundwater in deep reductive environments, and isotopic fractionation during precipitation, respectively. A promising method of reducing AMD formation is to prevent contact between dissolved oxygen and sulfide minerals by increasing the drainage level or by filling the shallow underground excavated area with cementitious materials."}{"Transport and retention of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in natural soils: Importance of soil organic matter and mineral contents, and solution ionic strength ": "Effects of soil organic matter and mineral contents, and solution ionic strength on the transport of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in different types of soils (i.e., desert soil, black soil, and red soil) were systematically investigated with a set of laboratory column experiments. The retention of PFOA in the soils under two solution ionic strengths conditions (1.0\u202fmM and 10.0\u202fmM CaCl2) followed an order of red soil > black soil > desert soil (expect red soil in 10\u202fmM CaCl2). PFOA retention in the black soil (soil organic carbon content: 2.57%) was higher than that in the desert soil (soil organic carbon content: 0.05%). In addition, PFOA also showed higher mobility in treated black soils with lower organic carbon contents. These results suggest that the hydrophobic interaction is a key mechanism governing PFOA retention and transport in soils. Besides, more PFOA retention in the red soil (zeta potential: 7.25\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fmV and 14.80\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.20\u202fmV) than the desert soil (\u221215.70\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fmV and\u202f\u2212\u202f9.11\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fmV) was observed, suggesting that electrostatic interaction may be another important mechanism for PFOA retention and transport in soils. Increasing ionic strength slightly increased the retention of PFOA in negatively charged desert and black soils, but significantly decreased the retention of PFOA in the positively charged red soil. Findings of this study point to the importance of soil physiochemical properties to the fate and transport of PFOA in natural soils."}{"Pore scale investigation on scaling-up micro-macro capillary number and wettability on trapping and mobilization of residual fluid ": "The mobilization mechanism of the trapped phases controlled by the viscous force and capillary force in porous media is crucial to various engineering applications. In this paper, pore scale water flooding process in rock models with nonuniform wettability is simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using the volume of fluid (VOF) model. Four types of rock are imaged by micro-CT (\u03bc-CT) and adopted as inputs to generate the structured mesh models. The simulations of two-phase flow are carried out to study the immiscible displacement process in the development of oil fields. The scaling-up critical capillary number at micro-macro scale are acquired and validated, the effects of which on relative permeability, residual oil recovery and immiscible displacement efficiency are analyzed. The simulation results indicate that the critical capillary number at microscopic scale ranges from 10\u22126 to 10\u22125 for water-wetted and oil-wetted rock respectively, and approaches to 1 at the macro scale. The effect of wettability on oil recovery is positive for intermediate-wetted or weak water-wetted rock, while negative for strong wettability."}{"Methane gas transport in unconfined aquifers: A numerical sensitivity study of a controlled release experiment at CFB Borden ": "Subsurface leakage of natural gas from petroleum wells can impact freshwater aquifers. Accurate prediction of gas migration in the subsurface will depend on knowledge of permeability, porosity, and flow system conditions. A series of two-dimensional numerical multi-phase flow simulations (CFbio) were conducted to investigate the role of multi-phase parameters (relative permeability and air entry pressure), flow system conditions (intrinsic permeability, anisotropy, and groundwater velocity), and geometric properties (layer thickness and layer lateral continuity) on the flow of gas-phase methane emanating from two variable-rate point sources in an unconfined sandy aquifer. Numerical simulations showed that for a homogeneous, weakly anisotropic aquifer, gas migrates almost exclusively vertically due to buoyancy, before venting to the vadose zone and atmosphere. As vertical migration became restricted through increased anisotropy, inclusion of lower-permeable layers, or increased horizontal groundwater velocity, an increase in the lateral component of gas migration was observed. This led to the formation of a broader lateral migration of the gas-phase plume and establishment of variably distributed vertical preferential flow paths, ultimately resulting in increased gas retention in the aquifer with relatively less methane reaching the vadose zone or atmosphere. The inclusion of a thin layer with moderately lower permeability (1\u20132 orders of magnitude) and increased air entry pressure was used to depict a fine-grained sand lens within a uniform aquifer. This subtle feature led to the formation of thin gas pools extending up- and down-gradient beneath the lens, allowing methane to travel much farther and faster than by groundwater advection alone, which is consistent with field observations during the experiment. In all scenarios investigated gas-phase methane was shown to migrate predominantly vertically due to buoyancy, until the aquitard permeability was <30% of the aquifer permeability. Our modelling demonstrates that even subtle permeability contrasts, together with capillary pressure changes demarcating grain-scale bedding, will lead to extensive lateral free-phase gas migration, and development of a more extensive and complex zone of impacted aquifer than presupposed."}{"Experiments and sensitivity coefficients analysis for multiphase flow model calibration of enhanced DNAPL dissolution ": "Multiphase flow modeling is often used for the comparison and optimization of subsurface nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) remediation schemes. The calibration of such models is a challenging task due to the lack of detailed data describing the initial NAPL spatial distribution and the processes governing the fate and transport of NAPLs in porous media. In this study laboratory scale experiments were conducted to evaluate reagent-enhanced dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) solubilization in saturated heterogeneous media. The DNAPL consisted of both pooled and residual saturation forms. To gain insight into the influence of various input parameters on effluent concentrations, the multiphase flow program was used to compute the sensitivity coefficients of key parameters, relating to the flow, flushing solution properties, soil parameters, NAPL distribution and mass transfer coefficient. The sensitivity coefficients were, in turn, used to aid in the model calibration and to underline the difficulties associated with the calibration of multiphase flow models, most notably the non-uniqueness of the calibration process when complete information is lacking. To alleviate this uncertainty and provide additional constraints, the conducted flushing experiments were jointly used to calibrate the multiphase flow model. The results of the model calibration suggest that the interphase mass transfer coefficient is dependent on the properties of the reagent aqueous solution used for DNAPL remediation, most notably the viscosity and interfacial tension."}{"Unacylated ghrelin is correlated with the decline of bone mineral density after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in obese Chinese with type 2 diabetes ": "Background\n                  Bariatric surgery is an effective and therapeutic way for different metabolic diseases.

Changes in anthropometric parameters, metabolic indexes, and serum UAG and obestatin were assessed preoperatively, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. BMD at lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH) were identified.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  RYGB resulted in statistical reductions of BMD in 3 different skeletal parts. After the first 6 months, BMD began to reduce and maintained a declining trend until 24 months postoperatively. Comparing to baseline, the maximal reduction of BMD was as high as 10.28% in total hip. The plasma concentration of UAG increased after 6 months (51.61 \u00b1 55.21 versus 71.95 \u00b1 64.91 pg/mL; P < .01), as well as the serum obestatin level (1.65 \u00b1 0.88 versus 1.71 \u00b1 0.99 ng/mL; P\u00a0> .05). Although there was a slight drop of both peptides in the first year, they were still above the baseline. Notably, in the second year, UAG and obestatin rose to their peak values, respectively (91.90 \u00b1 77.11 pg/mL and 1.74 \u00b1 1.09 ng/mL). There was a negative correlation between UAG and BMD in all sites. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the UAG level was the independent parameter associated with BMD at baseline (FN: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-.407, P = .012 and TH: \u03b2 = -0.396, P = .030 respectively), as well as the changes of UAG that were independently related with reduction percentage of LS BMD after 24 months (\u03b2 = - .379, P = .046).\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  The reduction of BMD in obese Chinese with type 2 diabetes was observed after RYGB. The pronounced increase of serum UAG acts as an independent risk factor for the decrease of BMD."}{"Clinical outcome of patients undergoing abdominoplasty after massive weight loss ": "Background\n                  Abdominoplasty is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures to reshape the body contour in patients who have undergone massive weight loss.\n               \n               \n                  Objectives\n                  This study was undertaken to assess the clinical outcome, complication rates, and risk factors for complications of patients undergoing abdominoplasty after massive weight loss.\n               \n               \n                  Setting\n                  University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.\n               \n               \n                  Method\n                  Clinical outcome was retrospectively analyzed in 121 patients, who underwent abdominoplasty.

This review not only discussed about the importance of microbes for bioremediation of heavy metals but also discussed about the challenges and limitations of native and engineered bacteria for bioremediation. Significance of bioremediation with the help of genetically engineered bacteria is in light because of its eco-friendly nature and minimum health hazards other than the physio-chemical dependent strategies, which are less eco friendly and dangerous to life."}{"Plastics and microplastics: A threat to environment ": "Plastics are synthetic polymer compound mostly made from petrochemical sources, such compound has high molecular mass and plasticity and certain chemicals are added to increase the performance and efficiency of the products. Plastics size less than 5\u00a0mm are categorized as Microplastics and it is one of the greatest potential threat to marine environment for the whole world. There are two types of micro-plastics i.e. primary micro-plastics and secondary micro-plastics. Primary microplastics are the by-products of particulate emissions released from industrial production, the release of plastics dust from plastics products. Secondary microplastics are larger plastic particulate material. These micro-plastics eventually end up in water bodies travelling all the way from rivers to seas or oceans. Microplastic can also act as a pollutant transport medium for other toxic elements such as DDT and hexachlorobenzene and eventually end up within the body of a living organism who consume it. The Government Agencies and Non-government organization of different nations have adopted many policies and laws to curb the harmful effects of plastics and microplastics. A concrete and comprehensive plan should be adopted for zero tolerance against plastics waste and peoples participation is a must to achieve the full success."}{"Urban heat island, urban climate maps and urban development policies and action plans ": "This paper aims at drawing attention to the deficiencies of urban heat island (UHI) mitigation strategies and urban climate maps (UCMs) towards practical implementations and efficient interventions in urban development policies and action plans (UDP/AP). The paper critically reviews the knowledge of the UHI and UCMs to identify the major shortcomings in the production of action plans. The shortcomings are identified in three aspects including (1) active involvement in UDP/AP (2) urban managerial and governmental actions, and (3) public engagement and participation. More specifically, it is first discussed that the current synthesizing paradigm of UCMs and UHI studies only considers the physical aspects of the problem/solution. Second, climate recommendations have paid a little attention to the imperative role, capacities and motivations of urban governance and managerial organizations. Third, mitigation strategies have been proposed without considering public needs and willingness. To overcome these challenges, a collaborative platform of UCM systems should be developed through a holistic approach. Such platform should provide a ground for efficient interventions in UDP/AP as well as interactions of all actors and indicators. To this end, the technical challenges of the UHI studies and UCM systems to link with UDP/AP are discussed. Second, UCMs should explicitly define the role of urban climate governance, prioritize the actions and state the policy agendas with regard to local government capacities and motivational elements. Finally, local communities\u2019 needs\u2019 and stockholders\u2019 opinions should be involved in the synthesizing process. As a potential solution, need-base approaches and weighing systems should be further developed to consider all urban actors\u2019 perspectives."}{"Treatment technologies of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and olive mill wastewater (OMW): A brief review ": "Attributable to the enormous population growth, tonnes of effluents are unavoidably generated throughout the agricultural activities. The inadequate effluents disposal induces perpetual contamination to the sea and river water sources, which has subsequently raised the public environmental concern. For that reason, the handling protocol of agricultural effluents was flagged up as an interest area for research. Despite the environmental hazards, agricultural effluents have the potential to be transformed from wastes into wealth via biological, physicochemical, thermochemical or a combination of processes thereof. The identical characteristics of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and olive mill wastewater (OMW) render the possibility of treating these wastes using the similar treatment method. Generally, biological treatment requires a longer process time compared to physicochemical and thermochemical technologies despite its easy and low-cost operation. Comparatively, physicochemical and thermochemical methods extend their potentiality in converting the agricultural effluents into higher value products more efficiently. This paper reviews the source and characteristics of both POME and OMW. Subsequently, a comparison of the current and alternative treatments for both effluents was done before the future perspectives of both effluents\u2019 treatment are paved based on the well-being of the human, environment, and economic."}{"Mechanothermal and chemical recycling methodologies for the Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) ": "Materials have become an integral part of our lives owing to their wide usability, but at the same time, they are affecting the nature antithetically. Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) is highly sought materials in an automobile, aerospace, structural, transportation and other industries due to its excellent mechanical performance, durability, and lightweight. Currently, miscellaneous industries manufacture engineered composite products using FRP materials, especially the products of hardbound thermoset resins, which are difficult to reprocess or reuse. Landfills and incineration are the most common technique for discarding the non-degradable FRP waste that has created an inimical impact on the environment and ecosystem. In order to reduce the ecological burden, we need to evaluate economical and feasible FRP recycling techniques. Extensive investigations conducted over the past decades have proven their efficacy in substituting the currently existing recycling processes. This review article enumerates the mechanical, thermal (fluidised bed and pyrolysis), chemical (low temperature and supercritical temperature) recycling methodologies, and their efficiency in degrading copious FRP materials like glass, carbon, natural etc. In addition, the economic and environmental aspects of fibre reinforced plastic materials based on life cycle assessment (LCA) has been discussed."}{"Experimental studies of slag filter for drinking water treatment ": "The study examined the use of granulated blast furnace slag, an industrial by-product from ferrous industries for drinking water treatment. A laboratory scale filter, 9\u00a0cm diameter and 40\u00a0cm with iron slag media supported on a gravel bed could completely remove turbidity, total suspended solids and colour for an average influent loading of 28.26 NTU, 128.85 mg/L and 177.05 PCU respectively at a filtration rate of 0.32 m3hr\u22121m\u22122. The average removal of hardness, sulphate, nitrate, chloride and iron were 35%, 83%, 71%, 28% and 94% for an average influent loading of 579.79 mgL\u22121, 367.72 mgL\u22121, 120.52 mgL\u22121, 355.67 mgL\u22121 and 1.49 mgL\u22121respectively. Doubling the filtration rate with slight increase in loading rate showed 100% removal for turbidity, suspended solids and colour whereas hardness, sulphate, nitrate, chloride and iron removals were 27%, 73%, 86%, 28% and 95% respectively. The maximum head loss for continuous operation without backwash was only 75\u00a0mm. Intermittent washing helped to improve the filtered water quality for various filtration and loading rates. An increase in the rate of filtration up to 1.28 m3hr\u22121m\u22122 did not have any impact on the quality of treated water except sulphate and nitrate. After backwashing, there was considerable improvement in chloride removal. The removal of physicochemical parameters was due to precipitation, adsorption and ion exchange with the formation of products both at the surface and within the slag media. FTIR and XRD results also confirmed the behaviour of slag as an anion exchange resin. The maximum head loss observed in slag filter was 190\u00a0mm at the highest loading level and filtration rate."}{"Combined ozone oxidation process and adsorption methods for the removal of acetaminophen and amoxicillin from aqueous solution; kinetic and optimisation ": "The growing use of pharmaceuticals raises questions on their potential risk to human health and water quality. This research aimed to introduce a combined treatment technique with high performance in removing pharmaceutical micropollutants (MPs) from aqueous solution. The research included two steps, ozone treatment (first step) and adsorption technique (second step). The elimination of acetaminophen (ACT) and amoxicillin (AMX) with ozone reactor, first step, was optimised by artificial neural network (ANN). The optimisation process included two independent variables, namely, initial concentration of MPs and ozone dosage. On the basis of ANN, the linear regression coefficient denoted by R2 between predicted and experimental MP removals was close to 1.

The lignin content of SB is very high, limiting its application for anaerobic digestion; therefore, FVW was used at varied ratio as substrate. Batch studies were conducted under ambient conditions in 500 mL glass bottles for 30 d at five different mixtures ratio of SB: FVW (100:0, 70:30, 50:50, 30:70 and 0:100) at different organic loading rate (OLR) varied from 0.85\u20132.4 g VS L\u22121 d\u22121 and at fixed Inoculum/Substrate (I/S) ratio of 1.

The kinetic coefficients determined at optimum ratio of 70:30 from Gompertz model were well supported the experimental data."}{"Enhanced nitrogen removal by the integrated constructed wetlands with artificial aeration ": "The removal of organic pollutants, ammonia, and phosphorus from seriously polluted river water has been extensively explored using various traditional integrated constructed wetland systems. However, the removal efficiency of nitrogen was extremely low due to the limited oxygen concentration of these traditional systems. Herein, a novel pilot-scale integrated constructed wetland system (CWs), which consisted mainly of a biotic contacting oxidization pre-treatment (BCO), an artificial aeration vertical sub-surface flow CWs, and a horizontal subsurface flow CWs\u00a0were applied to enhance the removal of total nitrogen (TN) under high hydraulic loading through artificial aeration. Results showed that, with the application of the novel CW systems, a total of 64.97% removal of TN was achieved with the average inflow of 11.39 mg/L and hydraulic load of 1.67 m3\n                     \n                        \u22c5\n                     m\u22122\n                     \n                        \u22c5\n                     d\u22121. Further analysis showed that the contributions of BCO, AVFCWs and HF CWs to TN removal were 13.86%, 15.97% and 35.36%, respectively. Besides the TN removal, the CW systems can also obtained about 75% of ammonia removal, within which artificial aeration vertical subsurface flow CWs unit occupied about 60% of contribution. Flowing by the application of this systems, the concentrations of ammonia and nitrate in the outflow decreased to 2.66 and 2.01 mg/L, respectively. The study indicated that the integrated constructed wetland system applied can be an efficiently potential technique for the removal of COD, NH4-N and TP from some rural wastewater."}{"Techno-economic assessment of CO2 direct air capture plants ": "CO2 direct air capture (DAC) has been increasingly discussed as a climate change mitigation option. Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about DAC's current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine DAC's anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art DAC technologies are performed, wherein, DAC technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions (HT DAC) and low temperature solid sorbent (LT DAC) systems, from an energy system perspective. DAC capital expenditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for DAC capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. DAC system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that LT DAC systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. CO2 capture costs of LT DAC systems powered by hybrid PV-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 \u20ac/tCO2 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. These new findings could enhance DAC's role in a successful climate change mitigation strategy."}{"Preparation, modification and environmental application of biochar: A review ": "Biochar is a carbon-rich material which can be prepared from various organic waste feedstock, such as agricultural wastes and municipal sewage sludge. Biochar has received increasing attention due to its unique feature such as high carbon content and cation exchange capacity, large specific surface area and stable structure. This review systematically analyzed and summarized the preparation, characterization, modification, and especially environmental application of biochar, based on more than 200 papers published in recent 10 year, to provide an overview of biochar with a particular on its environmental application. The physiochemical properties of biochar varies with the types of feedstocks. Pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal carbonization are the common methods for biochar preparation. Biochar can be modified by acid, alkali, oxidizing agents, metal ions, carbonaceous materials, steam and gas purging. The selection of modification methods depends on the environmental application fields. The biochar has been used for soil remediation and amelioration, carbon sequestration, organic solid waste composting, decontamination of water and wastewater, catalyst and activator, electrode materials and electrode modifier, which were discussed in detail. The application of biochar in the carbon sequestration should be further investigated at similar experimental conditions to obtain the consistent results. The effect of biochar on soil microbes should be further investigated to elucidate the dominant reason for the improvement of soil fertility based on different soil and feedstock. In addition, more attention should be paid to the release of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from biochar to the environment when biochar is practically used for the environmental remediation. The relationship between biochar structure and activation capability should be further investigated to clarify the activation mechanism of persulfate by biochar when it is used as activator. In summary, biochar has wide application prospect in environmental remediation, and the mechanism of biochar in environmental application should be further investigated."}{"Solid waste management: Scope and the challenge of sustainability ": "Solid waste management (SWM) is an integral part of an environmental management system. SWM approaches have been modified into a more practical and effective option to establish sustainability based on the \u201creduce\u201d, \u201creuse\u201d, and \u201crecycle\u201d (3R) principles. This review provides an overview of a wide range of existing SWM strategies with the following key objectives: (i) to comprehensively describe current technologies, strategic innovations, and monitoring tools, (ii) to provide an overview of prevailing waste management scenarios across different countries, (iii) to identify the roles of life cycle assessment (LCA) and other modeling tools in SWM, and (iv) to showcase feasible approaches for sustainable recycling and utilization of solid wastes. The current review finds that geographical positions and economic status of nations are important to dictate waste characteristics. A number of economic and LCA models have been described to facilitate future workers vis-\u00e0-vis organizations for the selection of appropriate waste management algorithms and for the evaluation of their eventual performance. In addition, this paper showcases various innovative solutions that have been reported for the achievement of smart and sustainable waste management plans in many countries."}{"Firefighters' and instructors\u2019 absorption of PAHs and benzene during training exercises ": "Introduction\n                  Training fires may constitute a major portion of some firefighters\u2019 occupational exposures to smoke. However, the magnitude and composition of those exposures are not well understood and may vary by the type of training scenario and fuels.\n               \n               \n                  Objectives\n                  To understand how structure fire training contributes to firefighters' and instructors\u2019 select chemical exposures, we conducted biological monitoring during exercises involving combustion of pallet and straw and oriented strand board (OSB) or the use of simulated smoke.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Urine was analyzed for metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and breath was analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Median concentrations of nearly all PAH metabolites in urine increased from pre-to 3-hr post-training for each scenario and were highest for OSB, followed by pallet and straw, and then simulated smoke. For instructors who supervised three trainings per day, median concentrations increased at each collection. A single day of OSB exercises led to a 30-fold increase in 1-hydroxypyrene for instructors, culminating in a median end-of-shift concentration 3.5-fold greater than median levels measured from firefighters in a previous controlled-residential fire study. Breath concentrations of benzene increased 2 to 7-fold immediately after the training exercises (with the exception of simulated smoke training). Exposures were highest for the OSB scenario and instructors accumulated PAHs with repeated daily exercises.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Dermal absorption likely contributed to the biological levels as the respiratory route was well protected.

Attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated for each disease and, for most of the diseases, by country, age and sex group separately for inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours and for the cluster of risk factors. Uncertainty estimates were computed on the basis of uncertainty surrounding exposure estimates and relative risks.\n               \n               \n                  Findings\n                  An estimated 829,000 WASH-attributable deaths and 49.8 million DALYs occurred from diarrhoeal diseases in 2016, equivalent to 60% of all diarrhoeal deaths. In children under 5 years, 297,000 WASH-attributable diarrhoea deaths occurred, representing 5.3% of all deaths in this age group. If the global disease burden from different diseases and several counterfactual exposure distributions was combined it would amount to 1.6 million deaths, representing 2.8% of all deaths, and 104.6 million DALYs in 2016.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Despite recent declines in attributable mortality, inadequate WASH remains an important determinant of global disease burden, especially among young children. These estimates contribute to global monitoring such as for the Sustainable Development Goal indicator on mortality from inadequate WASH."}{"Human biomonitoring in health risk assessment in Europe: Current practices and recommendations for the future ": "Human biomonitoring (HBM) is an important tool to survey the internal exposure of humans which represents the real life chemical body burden to chemicals and/or their metabolites. It results from total exposure to chemical substances from different sources and via different routes. These substances may be regulated under different legislative frameworks on chemicals (e.g., environmental, occupational, food safety etc). In occupational health, HBM has long traditions to control the exposures at workplaces. By providing accurate data on internal exposure, HBM data can improve human health risk assessment (RA) for both the general population and workers. Although the past few years have shown good examples on the use of HBM in the RA of chemicals, there is still quite some work to be done to improve its use in a regulatory RA.\n                  Under the scope of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (project HBM4EU, 2017\u20132021), the current study reviews the state-of-the-art of HBM use in chemicals RA with a special focus in Europe, and attempts to identify hurdles and challenges faced by regulators. To gather information on the use of HBM, including the availability of guidance on how to use it in RA, the RA schemes applied by different European or international organizations were analysed. Examples of such use were identified for a few selected groups of chemicals of concern for human health. In addition, we present the results of a survey, aimed at collecting information from national regulatory risk assessors on their day-to-day RA practices, the use of HBM data, and the obstacles and challenges related to their use. The results evidenced and explained some of the current obstacles of using HBM data in RA. These included the lack of HBM guidance values or biomonitoring equivalents (BEs), limited toxicokinetic information to support the interpretation of HBM data and, in the occupational health and safety (OSH) field, the lack of legal enforcement. Therefore, to support the integration of HBM in regulatory RA, we recommend, on one hand, the elaboration of a EU level guidance on the use of HBM in RA and, on the other hand, the continuation of research efforts to integrate HBM with new RA approaches using in vitro/in silico data and Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs)."}{"Capacity building and training approaches for water safety plans: A comprehensive literature review ": "The World Health Organization has recommended Water Safety Plans (WSPs), a holistic risk assessment and risk management approach, for drinking-water suppliers across low-, middle- and high-income countries, since publishing its 2004 Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality. While rapid WSP adoption has occurred, capacity is still catching up to implementation needs. Many countries and regions lack case examples, legal requirements, and training resources for WSPs, corresponding to widespread capacity shortfall in the water supply sector. We undertook a comprehensive review of the literature on capacity building and training for WSPs, with the goal of providing recommendations for multiple stakeholder groups at the scales of individual utilities, national governments, and intermediate units of governance. We propose a WSP training taxonomy and discuss it in relation to the stages of learning (introduction, practice, and reinforcement); describe the importance of customizing training to the target group, local language and circumstances; highlight the relevance of auditing for evaluating change over time; and call for robust methods to monitor WSP capacity development."}{"Long-term persistence of infectious Legionella with free-living amoebae in drinking water biofilms ": "Prolific growth of pathogenic Legionella pneumophila within engineered water systems and premise plumbing, and human exposure to aerosols containing this bacterium results in the leading health burden of any water-related pathogen in developed regions. Ecologically, free-living amoebae (FLA) are an important group of the microbial community that influence biofilm bacterial diversity in the piped-water environment. Using fluorescent microscopy, we studied in-situ the colonization of L. pneumophila in the presence of two water-related FLA species, Willaertia magna and Acanthamoeba polyphaga in drinking water biofilms. During water flow as well as after periods of long-stagnation, the attachment and colonization of L. pneumophila to predeveloped water-biofilm was limited. Furthermore, W. magna and A. polyphaga showed no immediate interactions with L. pneumophila when introduced to the same natural biofilm environment. A. polyphaga encysted within 5\u20137\u202fd after introduction to the tap-water biofilms and mostly persisted in cysts till the end of the study period (850\u202fd). W. magna trophozoites, however, exhibited a time delay in feeding on Legionella and were observed with internalized L. pneumophila cells after 3 weeks from their introduction to the end of the study period and supported putative (yet limited) intracellular growth. The culturable L. \n                     pneumophila in the bulk water was reduced by 2-log over 2\u202fyears\u202fat room temperature but increased (without a change in mip gene copies by qPCR) when the temperature was elevated to 40\u202f\u00b0C within the same closed-loop tap-water system without the addition of nutrients or fresh water. The overall results suggest that L. pneumophila maintains an ecological balance with FLA within the biofilm environment, and higher temperature improve the viability of L. pneumophila cells, and intracellular growth of Legionella is possibly cell-concentration dependent. Observing the preferential feeding behavior, we hypothesize that an initial increase of FLA numbers through feeding on a range of other available bacteria could lead to an enrichment of L. pneumophila, and later force predation of Legionella by the amoeba trophozoites results in rapid intracellular replication, leading to problematic concentration of L. pneumophila in water. In order to find sustainable control options for legionellae and various other saprozoic, amoeba-resisting bacterial pathogens, this work emphasizes the need for better understanding of the FLA feeding behavior and the range of ecological interactions impacting microbial population dynamics within engineered water systems."}{"Including aspects of climate change into water safety planning: Literature review of global experience and case studies from Ethiopian urban supplies ": "In recent years, the water safety plan approach has been extended towards climate-resilient water safety planning. This happened in response to increasing insight into impacts of climate on drinking-water and required adaptation to anticipated climate change. Literature was reviewed for published guidance and case examples, documenting how to consider climate in water safety planning to support future uptake. Climate-resilient water safety plans were piloted within a project in the water supplies of Addis Ababa and Adama, Ethiopia.\n                  Case examples have been published in four of six WHO regions with a focus on urban supplies. Integration of climate aspects focused mostly on the steps of establishing the team, system description, hazard analysis and risk assessment, improvement planning and development of management procedures. While the traditional framework focuses on drinking-water quality, considering climate change augments aspects of water quantity. Therefore, other factors affecting water quantity such as population development and demand of other sectors need to be considered as well. Local climate information and tools should be employed as a significant success factor for future uptake. Such information should be incorporated as it becomes available, and may \u2013 depending on the setting \u2013 be incrementally integrated into existing water safety plans or used to develop new ones."}{"The impact of on-site hospital wastewater treatment on the downstream communal wastewater system in terms of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes ": "This study quantified antibiotic and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) concentrations in hospital and communal wastewaters as well as the influents and effluents of the receiving urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTP) in two Dutch cities. In only one city, hospital wastewater was treated on-site using advanced technologies, including membrane bioreactor treatment (MBR), ozonation, granulated activated carbon (GAC) and UV-treatment.\n                  On-site hospital wastewater (HWW) treatment reduced gene presence of hospital-related antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic concentrations in the receiving urban wastewater treatment plant. These findings support the need for on-site treatment of high-risk point sources of antibiotic resistance genes.\n                  13 antibiotic resistance genes, Integrase Class 1 and 16S rRNA concentrations were quantified using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays and the presence and/or concentration of 711 antibiotics were analyzed.\n                  Hospital wastewater contained approximately 25% more antibiotics and gene concentrations between 0.4 log to 1.8-fold higher than communal wastewater (CWW). bla\n                     KPC and vanA could be identified as hospital-related genes and were reduced to under the limit of detection (LOD) during on-site treatment. Advanced on-site treatment removed between 0.5 and 3.6-fold more genes than conventional biological urban wastewater treatment (activated sludge). Advanced on-site treatment was able to eliminate 12 out of 19 detected antibiotics, while urban waste water treatment eliminated up to 1 (out of 21 detected). Different advanced treatment technologies were able to target different pollutants to varying extents, making sequential alignment more effective. MBR treatment was most efficient in antibiotic resistance gene reduction and ozonation in antibiotic reduction.\n                  \n                     bla\n                     KPC could only be detected in the influent of the urban wastewater treatment plant receiving untreated hospital wastewater. Similarly, vanA was only consistently detected in this treatment plant. These results indicate a positive effect of on-site treatment of hospital wastewater on the communal sewage system."}{"How current risk assessment and risk management methods for drinking water in The Netherlands cover the WHO water safety plan approach ": "In the Netherlands, safe and sufficient drinking water is provided to the general population by ten drinking water companies. To guarantee safe drinking water the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a Water Safety Plan (WSP), a Risk Assessment and a Risk Management (RA/RM) framework. The objective of the study was to identify legally required RA approaches, to document application of RA/RM activities at Dutch drinking water companies and to determine to what extent these RA/RM activities as a whole cover all the elements of the WHO WSP approach. This study could be of interest to both managers of large water utilities and decision makers.\n                  The assessment was performed by means of a policy review and interviews with two to four staff members involved in RA/RM from all ten Dutch drinking water companies combined with a joint workshop. The drinking water companies are well aware of the potential hazards and risks that can influence the drinking water quality. To guarantee the supply of safe and sufficient drinking water, the Dutch drinking water sector uses six different legally required RA/RM approaches. This study shows that by using the six legally required RA/RM approaches, all WSP steps are covered. WSP entails a generic risk assessment for identifying all hazards and hazardous events from source to tap, whereas the six legally required RA/RM each focus on specific risks at an advanced level. Each risk assessment provides information on specific hazards and hazardous events covering a part of the water supply chain. These legal requirements are complemented with additional RA/RM activities at sector and water company level such as codes of practices and standard operating procedures. The outcomes of all RA/RM approaches combined provide information from source to tap. When using multiple RA/RM approaches, it is crucial to share and combine information derived from the different activities."}
