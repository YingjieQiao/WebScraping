{"Re-evaluation of the century-old Langmuir isotherm for modeling adsorption phenomena in solution ": "One of the first reported equations to describe adsorption at equilibrium is the Langmuir model (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1918, 40, 1361\u20131403). Initially, the model was used to describe adsorption from the gas phase, along with adsorption from the liquid phase. Herein, the shortcomings of the Langmuir model for adsorption processes from liquid phase are revealed. This study reports a revised form of the Langmuir isotherm model that provides further insight on the nature of adsorption and desorption processes in condensed phases. This approach is anticipated to provide a theoretical background for universal calculation of the adsorption thermodynamic parameters. We also provide an overview of the methods that use the Langmuir equilibrium constant for calculation of thermodynamic parameters of adsorption and source of their limitations are highlighted."}{"DFT prediction of band gap in organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites: An exchange-correlation functional benchmark study ": "We report a comprehensive and systematic study of two halide perovskites by using density functional theory calculations. Two structurally different perovskites have been studied, which are cubic CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) and HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPI). We have used twenty-four exchange-correlation functionals, ranging from three LDA functionals, ten GGA functionals, seven MGGA and four hybrids among others have been tested, in order to determine the accuracy of these methods for the prediction of band gaps. Moreover, we have studied several possibilities to tackle the calculations of perovskites. That is, we have tested Numerical Atomic Orbitals with All Electron Relativistic calculations and compared to Plane Wave framework with pseudopotentials and relativistic corrections. Moreover, we have studied different k-points set, pseudopotentials types, with and without cell optimizations, with and without dispersion corrections and with and without Spin Orbit coupling. The results show that PBE and RPBE exhibit a good compromise between the accuracy of the results and computational demands."}{"The dependence of hydrophobic interactions on solute size ": "The dependence of hydrophobic interactions as a function of solute size has been investigated as an extension to our recent study detailing the physical origin of hydrophobic interactions. By determining the hydration free energy of two identical hydrophobic solutes dissolved in water, the critical radius (Rc) was calculated to be 3.25\u202f\u00c5, at ambient conditions. With reference to Rc, an initial process and a hydrophobic solvation process have been shown to govern the behavior of the dissolved solutes. These processes can be demonstrated by molecular dynamic simulations on C60-C60 fullerenes in water, and CH4 dimers in water. In the case of the former, by decreasing the distance between the C60 fullerene molecules, the hydrophobic interactions switch between H1w- and H2s-type hydrophobic processes. Additionally, maximizing hydrogen bonding was found to be the driving force that influenced the behavior of the hydrophobic solutes."}{"Substituent position effects on sunscreen photodynamics: A closer look at methyl anthranilate ": "Towards the development of a bottom-up rationale for sunscreen design, the effects of substituent position on the ultrafast photodynamics of the sunscreen precursor methyl anthranilate (MA, an ortho compound) were evaluated by studying para- and meta-MA in vacuum. Time-resolved ion yield (TR-IY) measurements reveal a long-lived S1 excited state (\u226b1.2\u202fns) for para-MA, proposed to be the result of a weakly fluorescent, bound excited state. In the case of meta-MA, TR-IY transients reveal a much faster (\u223c2\u202fns) excited state relaxation, possibly due to multiple low-lying S1/S0 conical intersections of prefulvenic character. While meta-MA may not be an ideal sunscreen ingredient due to a low ultraviolet absorbance, its comparatively efficient relaxation mechanism may constitute an alternative to common sunscreen relaxation pathways. Thus, our results should prompt further studies of prefulvenic relaxation pathways in potential sunscreen agents."}{"A comparison of different water models for melting point calculation of methane hydrate using molecular dynamics simulations ": "Molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful tool to understand the gas hydrate nucleation, growth, and dissociation at molecular level. Prerequisite of super-cooling during gas hydrate formation and a certain degree of super-heating during melting shows significant hysteresis in the transition between solid and liquid state due to large nucleation barrier. Different water models quantitatively differ in their prediction of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of bulk water, including phase behaviour. The present work carries out a systematic investigation of the effect of the chosen water model on the phase behaviour, in particular, the decomposition of methane hydrate. Void-induced melting has been used to predict the melting point of methane hydrate using TIP4P/Ice, TIP4P/2005, TIP4P, and SPC/E water models. This method avoids the need for a predetermined interface for melting point calculations and thus may have its importance in identifying dissociation kinetics of bulk hydrate."}{"Dual frequency-comb spectroscopy of chromophores in condensed phases ": "Femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy and frequency-comb spectroscopy have been individually developed to achieve better time and frequency resolutions, respectively. The two spectroscopic techniques have been developed for different systems, even though they use mode-locked laser in common. Recently, there was an interesting merge of the two techniques into a dual frequency-comb (DFC) spectroscopy, resulting in a new femtosecond spectroscopy with simple instrumentation and high data acquisition speed compared to conventional femtosecond spectroscopic techniques. By slightly detuning the repetition rates of two phase-locked frequency-comb lasers, both automatic time-delay scanning and parallel data recording with single point detectors are possible. Thus, we anticipate that the DFC spectroscopy would allow one to expand the application limits of the conventional femtosecond spectroscopic methods. In this Perspective article, we provide reviews of linear and nonlinear DFC spectroscopy theory and applications with a perspective on the development of coherent multidimensional frequency-comb spectroscopy."}{"A nonvolatile organic resistive switching memory based on lotus leaves ": "The resistance random access memory (RRAM) based on biomaterials, which has the advantages of sustainable, green and environment-friendly, has great potential application in the sustainable electronic devices. Herein, lotus leaves, a very common aquatic herb serve as a dielectric layer, was used to prepare an organic resistive switching memory device with Ag/Lotus leaves/ITO structure for the first time. The biodegradable electronic device demonstrates a nonvolatile resistive switching memory behavior with large resistance ratio and long switching endurance at room temperature. This work exhibits the application prospect of the biomaterials in electronics with the biodegradability and biocompatibility, which provide an effective supplement to the research of organic bio-RRAM."}{"Synthesis, characterization, optical and magnetic properties of pure and Mn, Fe and Zn doped NiO nanoparticles ": "Pure and 2% Mn, Fe and Zn doped NiO nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation method at calcination temperature 550\u202f\u00b0C. They were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, proton induced x-ray emission, Rutherford Back Scattering, Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, M-H loop and electron paramagnetic resonance. The obtained results indicate that the lattice parameter, crystalline size, direct energy gap and chemical functional group are significantly dependent on the kind of dopant element. Moreover, the dopant elements are not affected by the ferromagnetic nature of NiO nanoparticles while g-factor varies according to the kind of dopant elements."}{"Influence of temperature on the swelling pressure of bentonite clay ": "The swelling pressures of bentonites have been studied extensively due to their potential use as a barrier in radioactive waste disposal repository. Due to the radioactive decay of the waste, the temperature will increase in the repositories. Several experimental studies of the temperature dependence of the swelling pressure of smectites have been published while theoretical studies have received less attention. Atomic level simulations have been proven to be useful in broadening the understanding of clay materials in various conditions. Therefore, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to predict thermal effects on the swelling pressure of a sodium smectite clay. The study focused on two temperature regimes. In the first regime, the clay was placed in a frozen environment and heated while the second regime involves heating the clay-water system from room temperature. At low temperatures gradual melting is observed and the onset of the swelling takes place around 250\u202fK. At temperatures in the range of 300\u202fK\u2013600\u202fK a slight increase in the swelling pressure is observed. The results can be used to rationalize experimental findings in the swelling pressure studies of smectite clays."}{"Two polyhedral frameworks of an M12L24 spherical complex revealed by replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations ": "We performed replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations for self-assembly of an M12L24 spherical complex that consists of 12 palladium ions (M) and 24 bent ligands (L). We found two metal-ligand frameworks with polyhedral structure were mainly observed with almost equal probability. One of the two frameworks, which has the lowest potential energy, has the same symmetry, Td, as the framework determined by the X-ray crystallographic analysis. The other framework, which has a slightly higher probability, has a different symmetry, C3v. The latter framework is less likely to be observed experimentally than the former because of the difficulty in crystallization."}{"A simple and convenient method for the hydrolysis of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers to styrene-maleic acid copolymers ": "Styrene-maleic acid (SMA) copolymers are increasingly gaining attention in the membrane protein field due to their ability to solubilize lipid membranes into discoidal nanoparticles. The copolymers are synthesized as styrene-maleic anhydride (SMAnh), and need to be converted to the free acid form (SMA) before they are capable of solubilizing membranes. This hydrolysis reaction is traditionally performed under rather cumbersome reflux conditions. Here we report an alternative method for the hydrolysis reaction using simple and readily available equipment found in virtually all biochemical laboratories, namely an autoclave. Based on the results we propose an optimum set of standard conditions for the hydrolysis reaction, that should make the method easily accessible to a wide scope of researchers."}{"Sphingolipids and lipid rafts: Novel concepts and methods of analysis ": "About twenty years ago, the functional lipid raft model of the plasma membrane was published. It took into account decades of research showing that cellular membranes are not just homogenous mixtures of lipids and proteins. Lateral anisotropy leads to assembly of membrane domains with specific lipid and protein composition regulating vesicular traffic, cell polarity, and cell signaling pathways in a plethora of biological processes. However, what appeared to be a clearly defined entity of clustered raft lipids and proteins became increasingly fluid over the years, and many of the fundamental questions about biogenesis and structure of lipid rafts remained unanswered. Experimental obstacles in visualizing lipids and their interactions hampered progress in understanding just how big rafts are, where and when they are formed, and with which proteins raft lipids interact. In recent years, we have begun to answer some of these questions and sphingolipids may take center stage in re-defining the meaning and functional significance of lipid rafts. In addition to the archetypical cholesterol-sphingomyelin raft with liquid ordered (Lo) phase and the liquid-disordered (Ld) non-raft regions of cellular membranes, a third type of microdomains termed ceramide-rich platforms (CRPs) with gel-like structure has been identified. CRPs are \u201cceramide rafts\u201d that may offer some fresh view on the membrane mesostructure and answer several critical questions for our understanding of lipid rafts."}{"\u201cRafts\u201d: A nickname for putative transient nanodomains ": "The membrane raft hypothesis, proposed in 1997 by Simons and Ikonen, has played a paradoxical role in the history of biomembrane research. While it has generated a large amount of investigations, thus helping to increase our understanding of membranes, the object that gives name to the hypothesis, i.e. the raft itself, has been and still is an object of controversy, in which its very reality is often questioned. In this contribution I review the history of the hypothesis and its reception by membrane biologists, and summarize some of the valuable physico-chemical results that have been obtained while testing the raft hypothesis. To save a useful concept from its many misuses I propose that the expression \u201c(transient) nanodomains\u201d be employed instead of \u201crafts\u201d."}{"Memtein: The fundamental unit of membrane-protein structure and function ": "The concept of a memtein as the minimal unit of membrane function is proposed here, and refers to the complex of a membrane protein together with a continuous layer of biological lipid molecules. The elucidation of the atomic resolution structures and specific interactions within memteins remains technically challenging. Nonetheless, we argue that these entities are critical endpoints for the postgenomic era, being essential units of cellular function that mediate signal transduction and trafficking. Their biological mechanisms and molecular compositions can be resolved using native nanodiscs formed by poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) (SMA) copolymers. These amphipathic polymers rapidly and spontaneously fragment membranes into water-soluble discs holding a section of bilayer. This allows structures of complexes found in vivo to be prepared without resorting to synthetic detergents or artificial lipids. The ex situ structures of memteins can be resolved by methods including cryo-electron microscopy (cEM), X-ray crystallography (XRC), NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Progress in the field demonstrates that memteins are better representations of how biology actually works in membranes than naked proteins devoid of lipid, spurring on further advances in polymer chemistry to resolve their details."}{"How cardiolipin peroxidation alters the properties of the inner mitochondrial membrane? ": "Cardiolipins have multiple vital functions within biological cell membranes, most notably in the energy metabolism associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Considering their essential role, peroxidation of cardiolipins may plausibly have significant effects, as peroxidation is known to alter the functionality of lipid molecules. We used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study how peroxidation of cardiolipin affects the properties of the inner mitochondrial membrane. To this end, we explored what happens when varying fractions of fatty acid chains of cardiolipin are replaced by its four different oxidized products in systems modeling the inner mitochondrial membrane. We found that the oxidation of cardiolipin leads to a conformational change both in the backbone/head group and in chain regions of oxidized cardiolipin molecules. The oxidized groups were observed to shift closer to the membrane\u2013water interface region, where they formed hydrogen bonds with several other groups. Additionally, the conformational change turned out to decrease bilayer thickness, and to increase the area per lipid chain, though these changes were minor. The acyl chain conformational order of unoxidized lipids exposed to interactions with oxidized cardiolipins was increased in carbons 3\u20135 and decreased in carbons 13\u201317 due to the structural reorganization of the cardiolipin molecules. Overall, the results bring up that the conformation of cardiolipin is altered upon oxidation, suggesting that its oxidation may interfere its interactions with mitochondrial proteins and thereby affect cardiolipin-dependent cellular processes such as electron and proton transport."}{"Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid have distinct membrane locations and lipid interactions as determined by X-ray diffraction ": "Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) differentially influence lipid oxidation, signal transduction, fluidity, and cholesterol domain formation, potentially due in part to distinct membrane interactions. We used small angle X-ray diffraction to evaluate the EPA and DHA effects on membrane structure. Membrane vesicles composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and cholesterol (C) (0.3C:POPC mole ratio) were prepared and treated with vehicle, EPA, or DHA (1:10\u202fmol ratio to POPC). Electron density profiles generated from the diffraction data showed that EPA increased membrane hydrocarbon core electron density over a broad area, up to\u202f\u00b1\u202f20\u202f\u00c5 from the membrane center, indicating an energetically favorable extended orientation for EPA likely stabilized by van der Waals interactions. By contrast, DHA increased electron density in the phospholipid head group region starting at\u202f\u00b1\u202f12\u202f\u00c5 from the membrane center, presumably due to DHA-surface interactions, with coincident reduction in electron density in the membrane hydrocarbon core centered\u202f\u00b1\u202f7\u20139\u202f\u00c5 from the membrane center. The membrane width (d-space) decreased by 5\u202f\u00c5 in the presence of vehicle as the temperature increased from 10\u202f\u00b0C to 30\u202f\u00b0C due to increased acyl chain trans-gauche isomerizations, which was unaffected by addition of EPA or DHA. The influence of DHA on membrane structure was modulated by temperature changes while the interactions of EPA were unaffected. The contrasting EPA and DHA effects on membrane structure indicate distinct molecular locations and orientations that may contribute to observed differences in biological activity."}{"Cell mimetic liposomal nanocarriers for tailored delivery of vascular therapeutics ": "Liposomal delivery systems (LDSs) have been at the forefront of medicinal nanotechnology for over three decades. Increasing LDS association to target cells and cargo delivery is crucial to bolstering overall nanodrug efficacy. Our laboratory aims to develop LDSs for molecular therapeutics aimed at vascular pathology. We have previously established a liposome platform that is an effective delivery system for RNA interference in vascular cell types by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) decorated liposomes bearing an octa-arginine (R8) cell penetrating peptide (CPP). Further tailoring liposome membranes to mimic vascular cell membrane lipid constituents may be a promising strategy for increasing cargo delivery. Here we aimed to develop liposomal formulations that could make use of diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylserine (PS), naturally occurring lipid species that are known to influence vascular cell function, as a facile and efficient means to increase nanodrug efficacy without compromising clinical viability. We investigated the ability of DAG and PS to amplify the cellular uptake of our previously established LDS platform loaded with small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) cargo. Cellular fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed in conjunction with quantitative cell association assays and cytotoxicity assays to analyze the effect of DAG/PS on the differential delivery of fluorescently-tagged liposomes to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and on liposomal-mediated toxicity. In these studies, significant, dose-dependent increases in association to target cells were observed, as well as cell-type specific effects on cell viability. The stability and encapsulation-efficiency of the DAG/PS-modified LDSs were analyzed by standard nanoparticle characterization methods, and siRNA transfection efficacy was quantified to gauge delivery potential as a function of DAG/PS modification. Our results suggest that the signaling lipids tested here imbue our LDS architectures with increased therapeutic potential, without compromising stability, encapsulation efficiency, or biocompatibility, thus presenting a natural strategy to increase nanodrug efficacy and specificity."}{"Membrane-binding domains in autophagy ": "Autophagy is an intracellular degradation system conserved among eukaryotes that mediates the degradation of various biomolecules and organelles. During autophagy, a double membrane-bound organelle termed an autophagosome is synthesized de novo and delivers targets from the cytoplasm to the lysosomes for degradation. Autophagosome formation involves complex and dynamic membrane rearrangements, which are regulated by dozens of autophagy-related (Atg) proteins. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of membrane-binding domains and motifs in Atg proteins and discuss their roles in autophagy."}{"Characterizing the structure of styrene-maleic acid copolymer-lipid nanoparticles (SMALPs) using RAFT polymerization for membrane protein spectroscopic studies ": "Membrane proteins play an important role in maintaining the structure and physiology of an organism. Despite their significance, spectroscopic studies involving membrane proteins remain challenging due to the difficulties in mimicking their native lipid bilayer environment. Membrane mimetic systems such as detergent micelles, liposomes, bicelles, nanodiscs, lipodisqs have improved the solubility and folding properties of the membrane proteins for structural studies, however, each mimetic system suffers from its own limitations. In this study, using three different lipid environments, vesicles were titrated with styrene-maleic acid (StMA) copolymer leading to a homogeneous SMALP system (\u223c10\u2009nm) at a weight ratio of 1:1.5 (vesicle: StMA solution). A combination of Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize these SMALPs. We used a controlled synthesis mechanism to synthesize StMA based block copolymers called reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) SMALPs. Incorporation of the Voltage Sensor Domain of KCNQ1 (Q1-VSD) into RAFT SMALPs indicates that this is a promising application of this system to study membrane proteins using different biophysical techniques. V165C in Q1-VSD corresponding to the hydrophobic region was incorporated into the SMALP system. Continuous Wave-Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (CW-EPR) line shape analysis showed line shape broadening, exposing a lower rigid component and a faster component of the spin label."}{"Reliability of standardized uptake value normalized to lean body mass using the liver as a reference organ, in contrast-enhanced 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging ": "Purpose\n                  To evaluate the reliability of standardized uptake value (SUV) normalized to lean body mass for maximum (SULmax) and mean values (SULmean) as well as maximum SUV values (SUVmax) in contrast-enhanced 18F-FDG PET/CT by assessment of inter-reader agreement, using the liver as a reference organ.\n               \n               \n                  Materials and methods\n                  272 images of baseline PET/CT scans were analyzed.

POSS is a new generation organic/inorganic hybrid nanoparticle having possibility to improve the performance of polymers without sacrificing mechanical and thermal properties. TAIC and OvPOSS were used as crosslinking agents. After the compounding process, PLA, PLA/TAIC and PLA/OvPOSS composites were exposed to a gamma irradiation at various adsorbed doses ranging from 0 to 100\u202fkGy. The properties of neat PLA, PLA/TAIC and PLA/OvPOSS composites were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and tensile testing. Results showed that both chain scission reactions and formation of network structure occurred simultaneously after gamma irradiation. The highest gel formation was obtained from PLA composites including 3\u202fwt% OvPOSS at the dose of 100\u202fkGy. DSC results indicated that a sharp decrease in the degree of crystallinity (Xc%) of PLA in the presence of TAIC and OvPOSS was obtained after gamma irradiation process. All irradiated composites exhibited lower elongation at break and higher E-Modulus values at any irradiation doses. TGA results showed that irradiated samples were more thermally stable than the unirradiated ones. Moreover, the heat deflection temperature (HDT) of PLA in the presence of TAIC and OvPOSS was found higher than that of neat PLA. Brittle surface morphology of composites after gamma irradiation process was obtained from SEM analysis."}{"Selectively transform lignin into value-added chemicals ": "Lignin is one of the most important biomass resources. With the increasing consumption of petroleum resource, lignin transformation is of strategic significance and has attracted widely interest. As lignin is a random construction of aromatic monomers, the degradation products are usually very complex, which limits the scaling application of lignin as feedstock for valuable chemicals. Thus, it is desperately desired to develop highly selective approach to lignin conversion. This review first gives a brief introduction to the structure of lignin, and then summarized the methods for selective transformation of lignin into phenols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, alkanes and arenes. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of lignin selective transformation are discussed."}{"Artificial light-harvesting systems fabricated by supramolecular host\u2013guest interactions ": "Artificial light-harvesting systems (LHSs) have drawn increasing research interest in recent times due to the energy crisis worldwide.

The drug functions after absorption through the skin into the systemic circulation via capillary action at a certain rate. Use of traditional physical and chemical enhancers to improve the transdermal permeation rate by increasing drug solubility, diffusion coefficient, and reservoir effect is not feasible owing to the toxic side effects of the overuse of chemical penetration enhancers. Nano-formulations generally vary in size and range from 10\u2009nm to 100\u2009nm. The smaller particle size leads to increased drug permeability, stability, retention, and targeting, making nano-formulations suitable for transdermal drug delivery. The different applications of nano-formulations (vesicles or nanoparticles and nanoemulsions) have been widely studied. Here, the classification, characteristics, transdermal mechanism, and application of the most popular nano-formulations in transdermal drug delivery system are reviewed."}{"Photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction by photocatalyst innovation ": "The rising CO2 level, population boom and increasing energy demand prompts the need of an efficient and sustainable solution to tackle the global warming issue. Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission through the conversion of detrimental CO2 into methanol is one of the most promising solutions for optimising economic and resource efficiency. The utilisation of the abundant and sustainable sunlight to replace thermal and electric energy for CO2 conversion to valuable chemicals is a highly sustainable process and attracted much research interests. Herein, we summarised the catalytic methods for CO2 conversion to methanol, reviewed the photocatalytic properties and efficient photocatalysts, as well as their performance. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as a new member of the carbon nanomaterials family have attracted increasing attention owing to their excellent photoluminescence property, light harvesting capability, charge recombination suppression and effective electron transport ability.

Recently, the strategy of embedding pyridine units into D-A conjugated polymer backbones has attracted much attention due to the resulted lowered LUMO levels. In addition, the possible non-bonding interactions resulted from the nitrogen atoms also improve the coplanarity of the polymer backbones. All these factors have great contribution to enhance the device performance. In this review, we summarized the recent development of pyridine-embedded D-A conjugated polymers and their applications in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)."}{"Materials chemistry and the futurist eco-friendly applications of nanocellulose: Status and prospect ": "Cellulose, a linear biopolymer, is present naturally in all plants. Apart from being the planet\u2019s predominant natural polymer, it also offers a variety of features including excellent biocompatibility, lower density, substantial strength and the most beneficial mechanical characteristics, inexpensive in cost. Applying the mechanical or chemical techniques, cellulosic materials are transformed into cellulose nanofibres (CNFs) and even cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). These CNFs and CNCs exhibit excellent capabilities in comparison with native cellulose fibre. Nowadays, nanocellulose is being used in a variety of practical applications such as product packaging, papers as well as paperboard, food sector, healthcare, hygiene products, paints, skin care products and sensors.

AC was derived from rotten carrot, at different values of activating temperature under inert atmosphere, employing chemical activation method and ZnCl2 as activation agent. On the basis of results observed by surface area and pore size analysis, effect of activation temperature on synthesized AC was determined. Other material properties such as morphology, thermal stability, vibrational response, and crystal structure of prepared AC were studied using standard techniques of material characterization. Further, the electrochemical performance of synthesized AC was studied as an electrode, in aqueous, organic and ionic liquid based electrolyte. It was found that the synthesized AC based electrode exhibits highest specific capacitance (135.5\u202fF\u202fg\u22121 at 10\u202fmHz) in aqueous electrolyte and highest specific energy (29.1\u202fWh\u202fkg\u22121 at 2.2\u202fA\u202fg\u22121) and specific power (142.5\u202fkW\u202fkg\u22121 at 2.2\u202fA\u202fg\u22121) in ionic liquid based electrolyte.

The aim is to use the residual heat of process streams to raise the temperature of other process streams which are cold, thus minimizing the use of hot and cold utilities. The usual way to deal with this task is to pose a linear programming problem according to a transshipment model in order to minimize either the general services consumptions or the number of hot and cold stream matchings required. This optimization is subjected to several restrictions given by the energy balances corresponding to each heat exchange.\n                  The high number of variables and equations obliges the use of specific software to solve these problems, e.g. GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System). However, this software is not intuitive and requires a long time of training and a certain level of practice for the students to adequately use it.\n                  This work describes the use of Microsoft Excel-Solver for the sequential solving of HENS optimization problems according to the transshipment model. Solver is a much simpler, intuitive and easily available tool for the students who, besides, usually learn how to use it in the first years of their degree, in Informatics or similar subjects. Thus, it is not necessary to spend extra time in the teaching of the software, time that may be devoted to other contents.\n                  This paper presents an example of HENS problem proposed in the subject Simulation and Optimization of Chemical Processes corresponding to the Joint Master in Chemical Engineering of the Rey Juan Carlos University and the Aut\u00f3noma University of Madrid and solved by the students using Excel-Solver."}{"Workshops of innovation in chemical engineering to train communication skills in science and technology ": "This paper shows the application of an innovate pedagogical approach based on the project-based learning technique, focused on the training of communication skills in the framework of a workshop of innovation in chemical engineering. Written, graphical verbal, and non-verbal communication were tackled. For that purpose, a project of technological innovation was developed by the students in teams within the specific area of chemical engineering. A professional-like environment was simulated by a final workshop where the students defenced and supported their project by using oral presentation and production of a poster and a video. Several surveys were performed before and after the project application. The final survey revealed that both students and lecturers perceived an improvement on the communication skills of the students. Moreover, both lecturers and students declared satisfaction with the methodology, recommending its application in other disciplines."}{"Flipped classroom with cooperative learning as a cornerstone ": "This article discusses the reasons for flipping a classroom in an Engineering course and for including cooperative learning, supported by the literature. The case study then notes the challenges in changing the teaching mode, for example, in building front-loaded resources, and in coaxing students into using them. Bloom\u2019s taxonomy enables constructive alignment, adding a significant third pedagogic adjustment. Evidence from students shows what worked and what didn\u2019t. Findings were likely to alert other lecturers attempting greater student engagement to what is entailed and to the commonality of time-expense when improving learning outcomes. Then student feedback on the learning experience was analysed to show their perspective on the changes, and to be used to fine-tune the course for a second cycle of action research. The results showed that flipped classroom helped to develop and improve students\u2019 learning and critical analysis skills. Furthermore, cooperative learning improved students\u2019 communication skills and enabled them to build their teamwork and problem-solving skills. More than 90% of students agreed that flipped classroom with cooperative learning enabled them to extend their skills. Nonetheless, we show how much work is required to achieve this, and what pitfalls lie in the way."}{"Potential impact on the recruitment of chemical engineering graduates due to the industrial internship ": "Preparing, finding and making the transition from a Bachelor degree level to a successful job in the profession of Chemical Engineering requires not only an investment of time and effort but also prior training in a work placement environment, which allows the development and strengthening of the professional skills of the future graduates. A central aspect of this process is the ongoing consideration of an industrial internship to take advantage of the goals, strengths and opportunities that such alternative offers to undergraduate students. The Industrial Internship Program of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Universidade de Santiago de Compostela prepares third- and fourth-year college students to successfully integrate and thrive in the professional world and to have their first experience in a real-life work context, supported by a dynamic community of administrative and teaching staff and employers. Companies that collaborate in the training of future chemical engineers are distributed throughout the national territory, which allows a strong connection with the socioeconomic environment."}{"A successful experience with the flipped classroom in the Transport Phenomena course ": "Transport Phenomena is a core subject in Chemical Engineering studies. Its fundamentals need significant effort to be understood. Furthermore, students must apply theory to solve practical engineering problems, and it is usually problem resolution which has the largest weight in course assessment. However, due to the high amount of theory that must be covered in Transport Phenomena courses, usually little classroom time is reserved for practice and problem-solving skills are not worked in class. This constitutes a serious misalignment between learning activities, expected outcomes and evaluation. In this article, we propose the flipped classroom as a suitable methodology to solve this issue. As a pilot study, we flipped one unit of the Transport Phenomena course of the Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Chemical Engineering. Theory was provided through whiteboard animated video before the classroom sessions. Classroom time was mainly dedicated to participative discussion and problem solving in small groups. Satisfaction questionnaires were used to monitor student perception of learning quality before and after the methodology update. Student judgement on the interest of the subject and the value of the learnt concepts boosted about 20% on average with the flipped classroom. Around 70% of the surveyed students reported that the new methodology increased their motivation and that it helped them to learn both theory and practice. These results indicate that the flipped classroom is suitable for highly-technical classes with a large amount of complex theory, and it helps in the understanding and application of such theory."}{"Programming skills in the industry 4.0: are chemical engineering students able to face new problems? ": "A reflection on teaching programming at undergraduate level using advanced tools is presented. Advanced digital tools and computational evolution have shaped different areas, such as industrial process, communications, education and innovation. New technologies, such as the Internet of Things-IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, have boosted software development and computational skills in different areas. The chemical engineering knowledge acquired by senior students and programming skills can be integrated to develop computational tools, favoring chemical engineers to take advantage of new opportunities in digital area. Normally, programming courses are offered at the beginning of chemical engineering program, with examples not related to chemical engineering problems. To fill this gap, an elective discipline was created for final year undergraduate students in the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil). This paper discusses the main motivations for a new programming course, presents the structure of the course and shows some outcomes from a students' survey about what they have learned."}{"Learning by doing: Chem-E-Car\u00ae motivating experience ": "Since 2013 a group of professors from the Chemical Engineering Department of Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) has implemented a teaching tool based on the concept of \u201clearning by doing\u201d that has been successfully used in the US to increase motivation of students. This tool consists of a competition, called Chem-E-Car\u00ae, which helps to teach not only specific, but also transversal competences of the undergraduate students. They have to design, build and move a car controlled by a chemical reaction that it has to travel a specified distance while carrying a certain amount of water.\n                  The Chem-E-Car\u00ae World Competition took place at the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering, in 2017, and the students\u2019team from UCM presented a Chem-E-Car\u00ae moved by a battery based on an oxidation-reduction reaction and stopped by means of an iodine timer. It has been the first time that UCM has competed and the first time that the competition has taken place in Spain.\n                  Chem-E-Car\u00ae has contributed to develop both the application of Chemical Engineering knowledge and professional skills. Chem-E-Car\u00ae project has allowed the students to incorporate new abilities, such as team-working, leading, facing personal and professional troubles, interpreting and applying rules, project management and safety hazards."}{"Professional design of chemical plants based on problem-based learning on a pilot plant ": "This work describes a novel teaching methodology and its application in a subject framed in the last course of the master\u2019s degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Seville. The main aim consists of promoting a way to facilitate professional practice in this field to the students. Authors also aim at guiding the transition to the new learning requirements demanded by the European Higher Education Area (EHEA).\n                  The novel methodology is based on the development of a detailed design of a pilot plant that can be further evaluated by the students themselves. Students are also allowed to run experiments at the facility and carry out several standard tests to verify the quality of the results of their works. The novelty of this proposal consists of incorporating a real installation available in our department to drive new learning methodologies applied in Chemical Engineering curricula. The methodology is distributed across several tasks: training (self-learning), project execution and supervision, comparison with a real installation and pilot plant experiences. The application of the proposed teaching methodology provided quality didactic material production, high satisfaction of the students with the new learning approach and the fact that they gained practical experience at industrial scale."}{"Development and application of scoring rubrics for evaluating students\u2019 competencies and learning outcomes in Chemical Engineering experimental courses ": "This paper reflects on the interest of several teachers in reviewing the instruments and evaluation processes in Chemical Engineering experimental courses taught during three consecutive academic years at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid: Engineering Laboratory, Experimentation in Chemical Engineering and Process Scale-up.\n                  In this study, a methodology has been proposed to design, develop, and apply rubrics based on competence and learning outcome approaches. Thanks to the collaborative work of the three teaching teams involved, the application of comprehensive rubrics to provide gradual attainment of competence and formative evaluation over the academic years was rendered possible.\n                  Rubrics were developed to evaluate the main tasks of the courses: Personal Work, Written Report, and Oral Presentation. The rubric for each task contained the same evaluation criteria and dimensions with four levels of achievement, but differed in the scoring strategy depending on the course in which the rubric was implemented.\n                  The use of evaluation rubrics had a low impact on the final students\u2019 grade; its greatest impact was on Personal Work, as a larger number of students achieved higher scores. The rubrics fostered transparency in the evaluation process of the students and homogenized the evaluation criteria for a large number of teachers (22) and students (180 per year)."}{"\n               KBR (Kinetics in Batch Reactors): a MATLAB-based application with a friendly Graphical User Interface for chemical kinetic model simulation and parameter estimation ": "The simulation of chemical kinetic models is necessary in order to analyze comprehensive chemical reaction mechanisms and perform the estimation of the kinetic parameters. In many cases, a chemical process can be composed of several series and/or independent reactions that requires a complex set of kinetic equations to be solved. Computer-based tools for the study of kinetics of chemical reaction networks have been used since the last 50 years. However, the educational tools in this field should be friendly for the user and easy to learn and adapt to practical cases, avoiding long frustrating learning curves. Herein, the main objective of this contribution is to present a Matlab\u00ae application for the evaluation of Kinetics in Batch Reactors (KBR), which will help students to estimate kinetic parameters of complex chemical reaction models. The KBR application was used in the Final Degree Projects of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Engineering Degrees at Rey Juan Carlos University (Spain). This application provides a friendly Graphical User Interface to formulate any kind of kinetic model for subsequent simulation in order to monitor the evolution of reagents and products along the reaction time. Moreover, the student will be able to estimate kinetic parameters according to available experimental data as well as to apply sensitivity analysis of those parameters for particular cases of chemical reactions in batch systems. Finally, the results can be exported for further analysis as a spreadsheet of an Excel\u00ae file (.xlsx)."}{"Incorporating life cycle assessment and ecodesign tools for green chemical engineering: A case study of competences and learning outcomes assessment ": "Chemical engineers assume a broad range of roles in industry, spanning the development of new process designs, the maintenance and optimization of complex systems, and the production of intermediate materials, final products and new technologies. The technical aptitude that enables chemical engineers to fulfill these various roles along the value chain makes them compelling participants in the environmental assessment of the product in question. Therefore, the introduction of life cycle assessment (LCA) and ecodesign concepts into the chemical engineering curriculum is essential to help these future professionals to face design problems with a holistic view of the technical, economic, social and environmental impacts of their solutions. The teaching of these and other disciplines by means of student-centered methods, based on a holistic structure, have demonstrated better teamwork and communication skills. For that reason, this paper proposes a Micro (Assess-Analyze-Act) (M-3A) model of assessment mainly focused on closing the loop of the learning activities. This model has been applied to an ecodesign case study of the \u201cUniversity master\u2019s Degree in chemical engineering\u201d of the University of Cantabria/University of the Basque Country, with positive feedback of the students. They felt that the approach has allowed them to utilize their analytical skills in quantifying a situation before applying other subjective measures, and that the public discussion of the results was a satisfactory element for improving their communication skills. Moreover, the students found that the workload was nicely adjusted, highlighting the acquisition of 4 competences preferentially: teamwork, creativity; relevance of environmental issues and initiative and entrepreneurship. Finally, the students suggest that the application of this methodology into their degree could motivate future students improving their performance."}{"Learning-by-Doing: The Chem-E-Car Competition\u00ae in the University of Cantabria as case study ": "It is widely known that the Learning-by-Doing (LbD) pedagogical tool is not the most common form of education in Chemical Engineering nowadays. The aim of this work is to describe the application of LbD considering as case of study the participation of undergraduate students from the Chemical Engineering Degree of the University of Cantabria (UC) from Spain in the Chem-E-Car Competition\u00ae in the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering (WCCE10). The Chem-E-Car Competition\u00ae is a world-known student event run by AIChE, which provides chemical engineering undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in a team-oriented hands-on design and construction of a small prototype car powered by a chemical reaction. Within the context of the WCCE10, the competition gathered 18 teams from different countries all around the world. The UC team ended in the 6th position and won the award to the best inherent safety design. Overall, the benefits outpaced the time cost both for students and the teaching staff. This situation was not clear at the beginning of the project.\n                  Prior to this competition, LbD was used as an innovative pedagogical tool for the requested acquisition of competences. The proposal of a multi-annual Final Degree Programme was a win\u2013win situation for all the stakeholders. From a teaching point of view, the LbD let transferable and core competences to be evaluated not only internally, but also externally thanks to the competition. A survey was completed among the students that participated in the project. Competences such as \u201cProblem-solving\u201d and \u201cAdaptation to new situations\u201d were pointed out as those which were developed in a higher level by the students."}{"Improving the internship experience in the master of chemical engineering at the University of Granada ": "The purpose of this paper is to analyze the present status of the internship program of Master of Chemical Engineering at the University of Granada and establish a systematic model to annually acquaint the satisfaction of students. It will allow the improvement of the internship program according to the opinions of students. The authors have examined a total of 33 items grouped in 7 different blocks. The results showed that the majority of students were satisfied with the internship program. Students recognized that the possibility of carrying out the internship abroad and improve the soft skills are some of the advantages of the internship offer of master\u2019s degree. In fact, most of them prolonged their training period in order to perform their final Master project in the research center where they had carried out their internship. Some aspects should be improved, namely the communication between the academic tutor and the students, the information and guidance in the internship selection or the proposal of practices in more varied sectors. The findings of the present study had let to propose improvements for the internship program."}{"Prevalence of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in a wastewater effluent-receiving river in the Netherlands ": "Antibiotics are being used intensively for humans and livestock worldwide and have led to the presence of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as a point source for ARB&Gs, and water catchments consequently are potential receptors of ARB&Gs. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of antibiotics (macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines), ARGs (ermB, sul1, sul2, tetW), and class 1 integron (targeting the integrase gene), in a Dutch river that receives wastewater treatment plant effluent. Sediment and water samples were collected during one year along the river. The WWTP significantly increased the amounts of antibiotics and ARGs in the river as compared to the upstream samples, of which the antibiotics decreased once they entered the river. ARGs were persistent in the water and sediment from the WWTP effluent discharge point until 20\u202fkm downstream. This study provides insight in the prevalence of antibiotics and ARGs in a wastewater effluent-receiving river system in the Netherlands. Even though human antibiotic usage is low in the Netherlands, antibiotics, residues of antibiotics, and ARGs are detected in the river surface water-sediment system, which shows that a river has the potential to act as a reservoir of ARGs."}{"Efficiency of various recent wastewater dye removal methods: A review ": "Dye effluents released from numerous dye-utilizing industries are harmful towards the environment and living things. Consequently, existence of dye effluent in environmental water bodies is becoming a growing concern to environmentalists and civilians. A long term sustainable and efficient dye effluent treatment method should be established to eliminate this issue. Dye wastewater should be treated first before release to minimize its negative impacts towards the environment and living things. However, due to lack of information on efficient dye removal methods, it is difficult to decide on a single technique that resolves the prevailing dye effluent issue. Therefore, this paper reviews existing research papers on various biological, chemical and physical dye removal methods to find its efficiency through percentage of dye removal. Although there are numerous existing tried and tested methods to accomplish dye removal, most of them have a common disadvantage which is the generation of secondary pollution to the environment. This paper highlights enzyme degradation (biological) and adsorption (physical) dye removal as these are known as one of the most efficient dye removal techniques these days. This paper also suggests the usage of a combined adsorbent as it is envisioned that this technique has better efficiency and is able to remove dyes at a faster rate."}{"Removal of cadmium from wastewaters with low-cost adsorbents ": "Instead of using commercial activated carbon or ion exchange resins, researchers have worked on inexpensive materials, such as wastes from industry and agricultural operations due to their outstanding adsorption behavior toward heavy metal ions. Low-cost adsorbents are easily and locally available in large quantities. The modification of these materials could considerably increase their sorption capacity. In this review, the technical feasibility of various low-cost adsorbents for removal of Cd(II) from wastewaters has been discussed. Due to widespread cadmium contamination and its toxicity, there is considerable interest to remove it before discharge into wastewater streams. Several factors affecting an adsorption process such as pH, contact time as well as the reported maximum adsorption capacity values are summarized. The subsequent regeneration and reuse of adsorbents has been given considerable attention and some adsorption studies using real wastewater samples were also discussed."}{"Trends in CO2 conversion and utilization: A review from process systems perspective ": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) community has been struggling over the past few decades to demonstrate the economic feasibility of CO2 sequestration. Nevertheless, in practice, it has only proven feasible under conditions with a market for the recovered CO2, such as in the beverage industry or enhanced oil/gas recovery. The research community and industry are progressively converging to a conclusion that CO2 sequestration has severe limitations for the value proposition. Alternatively, creating diverse demand markets and revenue streams for the recovered almost-pure CO2 may prevail over CO2 sequestration option and improve the economic feasibility of this climate change mitigation approach. As such, research in the carbon capture and management field is seen to be shifting towards CO2 utilization, directly and indirectly, in energy and chemical industries.\n                  In this paper, we have critically reviewed the literature on carbon capture, conversion, and utilization routes and assessed the progress in the research and developments in this direction. Both physical and chemical CO2 utilization pathways are studied and the principles of key routes are identified. The literature is also probed in addressing the process integration scenarios and the performance assessment benchmarks."}{"Fabrication of advance magnetic carbon nano-materials and their potential applications: A review ": "Novel magnetic carbon nano-materials have attracted great interest in recent years due to their potential applications in many areas that exploit the combined advantage of magnetic with nano-scale properties. These materials are suitable for the catalysis, adsorption, carbon capture, energy and hydrogen storage, drug delivery, bio-sensing and cancer detection. This is due to some of amazing properties that allow them to be utilized multiple functionalities including high porosity, distinguished structures, uniform morphologies, high stability, high magnetic properties and high conductivity. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of promising methods for synthesis of magnetic carbon nano-materials and their applications."}{"Development of peroxidase enzyme immobilized magnetic nanoparticles for bioremediation of textile wastewater dye ": "Peroxidase enzyme plays a major role in the degradation of phenolic compounds such as azo dyes. This enzyme was isolated and purified from the bioremediation products of textile wastewater containing direct green azo dye in a UFC/CSA prototype bioreactor. To improve the enzyme stability, efficiency and recyclability, peroxidase was immobilized on Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles produced and modified by co-precipitation using glutaraldehyde. The immobilized enzyme was characterized by transmission electron microscopy analysis and examined against different pH as well as storage time and temperatures. The MNPs-immobilized peroxidise was remarkable stable towards temperature and pH perturbations, compared to the free enzyme form. Moreover, the immobilized peroxidase maintained its full activity upon storage at 4 and 25\u2009\u00b0C for 90 days, and upon recycling for up to 100 cycles. Finally, the MNPs-immobilized peroxidase was successfully employed to decolorize dyes of different chemical natures in a lab scale bioreactor. Hence, we believe that the immobilized peroxidase on magnetic nanoparticles reported in this work can be potentially used in various industrial and environmental applications."}{"A review of integrated photocatalyst adsorbents for wastewater treatment ": "Photocatalysis has the best potential to replace the conventional wastewater treatment technology due to its utilization of visible light to photo-degrade organic and inorganic contaminants. However, when applied in slurry form, agglomeration of nanoparticle will lead to serious decrease in photocatalytic performance due to hinderance effect. By combining the photocatalyst and adsorbents, which is designated as integrated photocatalyst adsorbent (IPCA), an adsorbent material which also degrades toxic organic compounds in the presence of UV/visible light irradiation could be produced. The compound does not only preserve all the interesting characteristics of both individual components, but also overcomes serious drawbacks, such as low absorptivity, rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and hinderance effect of photocatalyst when applied in slurry form. There are several criteria that must be obeyed by the absorbent material used such as high absorption capacity to target compound, reasonable transparency to UV\u2013vis light, high surface area, inhibition of photocatalyst leaching and good stability with dispersing solvent. In this review article, the authors presented an overview on the application of photocatalyst, adsorbents and integrated photocatalyst adsorbents for wastewater treatment. Moreover, the discussions were also focused on the major adsorbent which has been integrated with photocatalyst such as carbon, clays, zeolite matrix materials and others. Additionally, the mechanisms of the adsorption of emerging organic contaminants with adsorbents in IPCA were also discussed to clearly understand the possible interactions between organic contaminants and IPCA. Outlook on IPCA study were also discussed to further broaden the prospective of this technology."}{"Green synthesis of silver doped nano metal oxides of zinc & copper for antibacterial properties, adsorption, catalytic hydrogenation & photodegradation of aromatics ": "Silver doped copper and zinc nano metal oxides were synthesized in the presence of Sida rhombifolia leaf extract by self propagating sol-gel autocombustion process. X-ray diffraction studies indicated the formation of wurtzite hexagonal phase for ZnO, monoclinic for CuO and FCC structure for silver nanocomposites. The surface morphology of nanoparticles were studied using FESEM. FTIR studies confirmed the presence of silver & M\u2013O bonds. UV\u2013vis DRS studies revealed that silver doping reduced the band-gap energy which overcomes fast recombination rate of electron-hole pairs of the nanoparticles. TGA studies indicated enhanced thermal stability of doped nanocomposites. Hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with NaBH4 showed that Ag/ZnO & Ag/CuO exhibited greater photoreduction capacity than undoped ZnO & CuO. ZnO, Ag/ZnO, CuO & Ag/CuO nanocomposites have antagonistic effect on the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus with greater inhibition zones. Ag/CuO NPs exhibited the highest sensitivity against various bacterial strains with MIC below 1\u2009mg. Ag/CuO nanorods showed excellent adsorption properties with high removal capacity of MG of about 90%. Kinetic, thermodynamic and equilibrium studies on adsorption of MG onto Ag/CuO nanorods was carried out. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO and Ag/ZnO nanocomposites was investigated by studying the degradation of methylene blue & malachite green under UV irradiation. Ag/ZnO exhibited better photodegradation efficiency of MG & MB and follows pseudo first order kinetic model. Thus the simple, low-cost and eco-friendly herbal synthesis of oxides of silver doped zinc & copper provides nanocomposites with multifunctional applications."}{"Towards industrial implementation of Electro-Fenton and derived technologies for wastewater treatment: A review ": "This is an updated critical review of the advances towards the full exploitation of diverse Electro-Fenton technologies for the decontamination of real effluents at industrial scale. The main relevant innovations spanning almost three decades are analyzed from a historical perspective. Electro-Fenton, Photoelectro-Fenton, Peroxi-coagulation, Sonoelectro-Fenton and related methods are assessed. Economic aspects and engineering challenges that should be overcome to reach the title goal, such as efficient cathodes for H2O2 electrogeneration, heterogeneous catalysis, the pH issue, and the iron sludge problem are particularly highlighted. A special section is devoted to examining the R&D works on actual wastewaters. Overviews of both pilot scale studies currently available in the literature and companies that already provide some of these technologies are presented. Finally, suggestions for further development at a large scale, depending on wastewater characteristics, are summarized."}{"Review of extractive distillation. Process design, operation, optimization and control ": "Extractive distillation processes enable the separation of non-ideal mixtures, including minimum or maximum boiling azeotropes and low relative volatility mixtures. Unlike azeotropic distillation, the entrainer fed at another location than the main mixture induces an extractive section within the column. A general feasibility criterion shows that intermediate and light entrainers and heterogeneous entrainers are suitable along common heavy entrainers. Entrainer selection rules rely upon selectivity ratios and residue curve map (rcm) topology including univolatility curves. For each type of entrainer, we define extractive separation classes that summarize feasibility regions, achievable products and entrainer \u2013 feed flow rate ratio limits. Case studies are listed as Supplementary materials. Depending on the separation class, a direct or an indirect split column configuration will allow to obtain a distillate product or a bottom product, which is usually a saddle point of rcm. Batch and continuous process operations differ mainly by the feasible ranges for the entrainer \u2013 feed flow rate ratio and reflux ratio. The batch process is feasible under total reflux and can orient the still path by changing the reflux policy. Optimisation of the extractive process must systematically consider the extractive column along with the entrainer regeneration column that requires energy and may limit the product purity in the extractive column through recycle. For the sake of reducing the energy cost and the total cost, pressure change can be beneficial as it affects volatility, or new process structures can be devised, namely heat integrated extractive distillation, extractive divided wall column or processes with preconcentrator."}{"Optimisation approaches for supply chain planning and scheduling under demand uncertainty ": "This work presents efficient MILP-based approaches for the planning and scheduling of multiproduct multistage continuous plants with sequence-dependent changeovers in a supply chain network under demand uncertainty and price elasticity of demand. This problem considers multiproduct plants, where several products must be produced and delivered to supply the distribution centres (DCs), while DCs are in charge of storing and delivering these products to the final markets to be sold. A hybrid discrete/continuous model is proposed for this problem by using the ideas of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and global precedence representation. In order to deal with the uncertainty, we proposed a Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (HMPC) approach for this particular problem. Despite of its efficiency, the final solution reported still could be far from the global optimum. Due to this, Local Search (LS) algorithms are developed to improve the solution of HMPC by rescheduling successive products in the current schedule. The effectiveness of the proposed solution techniques is demonstrated by solving a large-scale instance and comparing the solution with the original MPC and a classic Cutting Plane approach adapted for this work."}{"Sustainable production of chemical intermediates for nylon manufacture: A techno-economic analysis for renewable production of caprolactone ": "Caprolactone is a precursor for the synthesis of caprolactam, the key monomer for nylon-6 which is produced globally at a scale of 4 million tonnes per annum. This work describes and assesses a bio-based production route to caprolactone from an agricultural residue, specifically corn stover, via glucose, fructose, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and 1,6-hexanediol. The material and energy balances, the cost efficiency, as well as on the potential reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reported and discussed. The developed process model was simulated in Aspen Plus\u2122 with the optimization and energy integration performed for the entire process from corn stover to caprolactone. A sensitivity analysis was performed with consideration of various economic factors to explore the process economics. The results of the techno-economic and environmental assessment show that a bio-based caprolactone production process via glucose and HMF could be competitive with conventional hydrocarbon-based processes when major by-products are valorised and has a lower environmental impact. Areas where further investigation is needed to improve sustainable caprolactone production are identified and discussed."}{"Biodiesel production catalyzed by liquid and immobilized enzymes: Optimization and economic analysis ": "In this work, the use of enzymes as alternative catalysts for the production of biodiesel was evaluated. Due to the high price of enzymes, process optimization and economical evaluation is essential to evaluate the feasibility of their use. Two alternatives were proposed. The first one evaluated the use of liquid enzyme while the second alternative analyzed the use of immobilized enzyme for the transesterification of castor oil. Both alternatives were investigated as an integral part of the whole production plant and optimized considering the profit of the process as objective function. For an annual biodiesel production capacity of 250,000tons, the process with liquid enzymes resulted in higher total investment costs due to the complex steps for the biodiesel separation. However, the higher cost of immobilized enzymes requires that this enzyme is reused at least 300 times to obtain a profit similar to the liquid enzyme-based process, which resulted in a production cost of 0.78US$/kg of biodiesel and a plant profit of 51.6 million US$/year for the defined plant capacity."}{"Castor oil biorefinery: Conceptual process design, simulation and economic analysis ": "The paper presents the conceptual design of a castor oil biorefinery. Castor oil contains over 90% ricinoleic acid (12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic) triglyceride, a versatile functional molecule. Fatty methyl ricinoleic ester (FAMRE) is the key building block. This can be valorised as biodiesel, but more profitable is making biochemicals, namely high-value polyamides. The goal is the conceptual design, simulation and economic analysis of a biorefinery processing 80ktpy castor oil, equally shared between biodiesel and biochemicals. The process synthesis work is based on research papers and patents, supported by simulation with Aspen Plus\u2122 . The biorefinery involves three plants: transesterification, pyrolysis and amination. Two innovative technologies are developed for transesterification, by heterogeneous catalysis in variable-time PFR and by homogeneous catalysis in reactive-extraction device. The reactors are simulated by employing detailed kinetics such that the ester composition fulfils the specifications set by the quality norms for biodiesel. Both methods result in compact and low energy processes, but the first delivers more valuable high-purity glycerol. FAMRE pyrolysis supplies heptanal, a valuable intermediate for specialities, and methyl undecenoate, converted further to \u03c9-aminoundecanoic acid. Energy saving of 77% is achieved by employing mechanical vapour recompression. The amination is complex as chemistry and processing, involving aqueous solutions and solids. The economic analysis estimates capital costs and minimum product prices for 20% ROI. The performance and contribution of each process is highlighted. The bottleneck in design is the amination plant, capital-intensive and handling large amounts of process water. This stage makes necessary high equipment and energy costs but delivers a high-value monomer that boost the profitability. The result is that at equal throughput the biochemicals bring 2.5 times more revenues than biodiesel. By a synergy effect, high-value biochemicals sustain the profitability of commodity biodiesel, which in turn offers a broader market and secures stable revenues for farmers."}{"A modelling approach to kinetics study and novel monolith channel design for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) applications ": "A systematic modelling approach was scrutinized to develop a kinetic model and design a novel monolith channel geometry for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) applications. An equation-oriented modelling tool, gPROMS\u00ae ProcessBuilder\u00ae, was employed to build the kinetic model for a commercial SCR catalyst by extracting intrinsic kinetic parameters from the experimental data collected in a conventional fixed-bed reactor in which resistances to mass and heat transfer were expected to be an influence. All catalytic chemical reactions and relevant transport phenomena were simultaneously considered for the kinetic model development. The kinetic model and parameters estimated were then summarized in a form of a user-defined function that would be utilized in a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package, ANSYS\u00ae Fluent\u00ae, to search for a novel SCR monolith channel geometry. An elongated hexagonal channel was found to have better performance in terms of NO conversion and pressure drop, in comparison with a conventional square channel."}{"Thermal analysis and heat capacity study of polyethylene glycol (PEG) phase change materials for thermal energy storage applications ": "Phase change materials (PCMs) generally offer high latent heats for a wide range of thermal energy storage technologies. As typical organic PCMs, polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been widely studied due to their high latent enthalpy, non-toxic and non-corrosive natures. However, the thermal properties especially the heat capacities of PEG, which would play a vital role in theoretically and technically investigating PCM thermal performance, have never been studied in a wide temperature region. Herein, we reported the heat capacities of PEG samples with the molar massvarying from 1000 to 20,000 for the first time in the temperature range from (1.9 to 400) K using a combination method of Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Furthermore, the standard molar heat capacity, entropy and enthalpy at 298.15\u202fK and 0.1\u202fMPa were calculated based on the heat capacity curve fitting. Meanwhile, the phase transition temperature and enthalpy, thermal conductivity and thermal stability of these PEG samples were measured using various thermal analysis methods, and these thermal properties were also compared with the previous results."}{"Bio- and mineral acid leaching of rare earth elements from synthetic phosphogypsum ": "Leaching of six individual rare earth (yttrium, cerium, neodymium, samarium, europium, and ytterbium) doped synthetic phosphogypsum samples using a suite of lixiviants was conducted. The lixiviants chosen for this study were phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, and a \u201cbiolixiviant\u201d consisting of spent medium containing organic acids from the growth of the bacterium Gluconobacter oxydans on glucose. The biolixiviant had a pH of 2.1 and the dominant organic acid was determined to be gluconic acid, present at a concentration of 220\u202fmM. The leaching behaviors of the studied lixiviants were compared and rationalized by thermodynamic simulations. The results suggest that at equivalent molar concentrations of 220\u202fmM the biolixiviant was more efficient at rare earth element (REE) extraction than gluconic acid and phosphoric acid but less efficient than sulfuric acid. Unlike the organic acids, at pH 2.1 the mineral acids failed to extract REE, likely due to different complexation and kinetic effects."}{"Isotherm, kinetic and thermodynamic studies on the adsorption of paclitaxel onto Sylopute ": "Batch experimental studies were carried out on the adsorption of paclitaxel onto Sylopute, with the data then being fit to the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models. A comparison of the results revealed that, among the four isotherm models considered, the Freundlich isotherm model could account for the adsorption isotherm data with the highest accuracy. From the analysis of adsorption isotherms, it was found that the adsorption capacity increased with an increasing temperature and the adsorption of paclitaxel onto Sylopute was favourable. The obtained kinetics data for paclitaxel adsorption with Sylopute agreed well with the pseudo-second-order model. In addition, according to the intraparticle diffusion model, intraparticle diffusion played a dominant role in paclitaxel adsorption. Thermodynamic parameters revealed the endothermic, irreversible, and nonspontaneous nature of the adsorption."}{"Heat capacities of potential organic phase change materials ": "The heat capacity of a material is an important factor for many applications, including phase change material (PCM) selection for thermal energy storage. Aside from storing energy via the latent heat of a phase transition, significant sensible heat can be stored using the material\u2019s heat capacity outside the transition temperature region. Furthermore, accurate heat capacity values are required to model and thereby optimize PCM heat storage systems. Various group additivity models can be used to estimate the heat capacity of organic liquids. However, these methods do not distinguish isomers built of the same base units. In the present study the liquid phase heat capacities of five isomeric, 12-carbon, linear, saturated fatty esters (potential PCMs) have been measured experimentally, and the results are compared to calculations from several group additivity methods. It was found that the heat capacities of the liquid esters are well described by the group additivity models, and that each of the esters had approximately the same heat capacity at a given temperature, despite their structural differences. The heat capacity of another isomer, dodecanoic acid, was also compared to the ester isomers, and found to be significantly different. The group additivity methods also were able to accurately represent the heat capacity of the acid isomer."}{"Thermodynamic properties of organic substances: Experiment, modeling, and technological applications ": "In this review, results of the studies of thermodynamic properties of organic substances conducted at the Chemistry Department of the Belarusian State University (Minsk, Belarus) over a period of more than 50\u202fyears are summarized. Emphasis is made on precise measurements (both calorimetry and equilibria) and prediction methods, including group-contribution, quantum chemical, and statistical mechanical, for a broad range of thermodynamic properties of various classes of chemical substances. The principal purposes of these studies were to establish relationships between thermodynamic properties of organic substances and their molecular structures, develop methods of extrapolation and prediction of the properties of substances lacking experimental data, and provide thermodynamic background for innovative energy- and resource-saving technologies."}{"The NADES glyceline as a potential Green Solvent: A comprehensive study of its thermophysical properties and effect of water inclusion ": "In this paper, two Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents, glyceline (Gly) and glyceline-water (GlyW), containing choline chloride as acceptor H-bond compound and glycerol as donor H-bond group are studied. For glyceline the mole relation is 1 (choline chloride): 2 (glycerol) and for glyceline-water the mole relation is 1 (choline chloride): 1.99 (glycerol): 1.02 water.

The binary NADES (Gly) is a more structured liquid than ternary one (GlyW)."}{"Fractionation of REE, U, and Th in natural ore-forming hydrothermal systems: Thermodynamic modeling ": "This contribution presents a thermodynamic model revealing the mechanisms responsible for separation of Heavy and Light Rare Earth (HREE and LREE) phosphates in natural hydrothermal systems at temperatures of 250\u2013350\u202f\u00b0C. Our calculations were performed for an isothermal column of rock containing 0.5\u202fwt% of apatite (Ca phosphate), which served as an immobilizing agent for REE dissolved in the solution. REE were transported by 10\u202fwt% NaCl acidic solution. The model accounted for formation of REE phosphate solid solutions through a regular mixing model. It demonstrates that hydrothermal flushing can efficiently separate REE forming xenotime (HREE phosphate solid solutions) at the beginning of the column, and re-transportation of monazite (LREE rich) to the end of the column. This separation is primarily due to the fact that at elevated temperatures stability LREE chloride complexes is significantly higher than that for HREE. The model also evaluates behavior of U and Th, which accompany REE in vast majority of natural locations. It was found that U strongly fractionates to xenotime, whereas Th fractionates to monazite. This phenomenon can be explained by the differences in crystal-chemical characteristics between monazite and xenotime, and the mobility of Th in aqueous solutions at elevated temperatures."}{"Vapor pressure and vaporization enthalpy studies of (+)-longifolene, (\u2212)-isolongifolene and \u03b2-myrcene by correlation gas chromatography ": "This paper examines the use of two different sets of standards, n-alkanes and a more structurally diverse group of cyclic and polycyclic molecules to evaluate the vaporization enthalpies and vapor pressures of (+) longifolene(\u2212)-isolongifolene and \u03b2-myrcene using correlation gas chromatography. Both sets of standards provide similar vaporization enthalpies and vapor pressures of the title compounds at T\u202f=\u202f298.15\u202fK within their experimental uncertainties. The group of cyclic and polycyclic hydrocarbons reproduce the vapor pressures of the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons at elevated temperatures best while the same properties of \u03b2-myrcene are best reproduced by the n-alkanes as judged by reproduction of both experimental boiling temperatures measured at reduced pressures and vapor pressures. The results confirm previous findings obtained on polycyclic hydrocarbons regarding the suitability of using structurally similar standards and suggest that n-alkanes are suitable vapor pressure standards for highly unsaturated acyclic hydrocarbons."}{"Solubility of l-tyrosine in aqueous solutions of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and dimethyl sulfoxide: Experimental determination and preferential solvation analysis ": "The equilibrium solubility of l-tyrosine in solvent mixtures of methanol (1)\u202f+\u202fwater (2), ethanol (1)\u202f+\u202fwater (2), n-propanol (1)\u202f+\u202fwater (2) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 1)\u202f+\u202fwater (2) were determined experimentally by using isothermal dissolution equilibrium method within the temperature range from 283.15 to 323.15\u202fK under atmospheric pressure (101.1\u202fkPa). At the same temperature and mass fraction of methanol (ethanol, n-propanol or DMSO), the mole fraction solubility of L-tyrosine was greater in (DMSO\u202f+\u202fwater) than in the other three solvent mixtures. The solvent effect was explained in terms of solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions. The preferential solvation parameters were derived from their thermodynamic solution properties by means of the inverse Kirkwood\u2013Buff integrals method. The preferential solvation parameters (\u03b4x\n                     1,3) for methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or DMSO were negative in the methanol (1)\u202f+\u202fwater (2), ethanol (1)\u202f+\u202fwater (2), n-propanol (1)\u202f+\u202fwater (2) mixtures with a very wide compositions, which indicated that l-tyrosine was preferentially solvated by water. While l-tyrosine was preferentially solvated neither by water nor by DMSO for the DMSO (1)\u202f+\u202fwater (2) mixtures. Temperature has a little effect on the preferential solvation magnitudes for the studied solutions. The higher solvation by water could be explained in terms of the higher acidic behavior of the solvent interacting with the Lewis basic groups of the l-tyrosine. In addition, the drugs\u2019 solubility was mathematically represented by using the Jouyban-Acree model, van\u2019t Hoff-Jouyban-Acree model and Apelblat-Jouyban-Acree model obtaining average relative deviations lower than 1.47% for correlative studies. It is noteworthy that the solubility data presented in this work contribute to the expansion of the physicochemical information about the solubility of drugs in binary solvent mixtures and also allows the thermodynamic analysis of the respective dissolution and specific solvation process."}{"Physical properties of seven deep eutectic solvents based on l-proline or betaine ": "Density, \u03c1, refractive index, nD\n                     , speed of sound, u, and viscosity, \u03b7, of the betaine\u202f+\u202fdl-lactic acid (1:2), betaine\u202f+\u202fdl-lactic acid (1:5), betaine\u202f+\u202fdl-lactic acid-water (1:1:1), betaine-levulinic acid (1:2), betaine-citric acid-water (2:1:6), l-proline\u202f+\u202flevulinic acid (1:2) and l-proline\u202f+\u202fdl-lactic acid (1:1) deep eutectic solvents were measured at several temperatures from 293.15\u202fK to 343.15\u202fK and at atmospheric pressure.

A new version of a Knudsen effusion apparatus, coupled with a quartz crystal microbalance, which is used for a reliable measurement of the mass flow from a Knudsen effusion cell, is described in detail. In the new system, designed and optimized for the vapour pressure measurement of ionic liquids, it is possible to measure the vapour pressure of small samples using very short effusion time over a wide temperature range. This apparatus allows the vapour pressure measurements using step-temperature and continuous-temperature modes that have the advantage of reducing the measurement time interval and minimize the effect of a sample degradation. A significant number of improvements on the performance and capability for the vapour pressure measurements of ionic liquids has been implemented: in situ temperature control of the vacuum chamber for a better stability of background signal; a new design of a stainless steel effusion cell to decrease the reactivity and sample decomposition; dual temperature control ensuring a positive temperature gradient between bottom and top of the cell in order to avoid the ionic liquids condensation on the effusion cell lid and significantly improved stability of the time frequency derivative at high temperatures; Installation and test of a mass flow tube, on the top of the outlet of the cell lid oven block in order to increase the mass sensitivity coefficient of QCM. The tests and benchmarking concerning the measurement of vapour pressures of ionic liquids performed with [C2mim][NTf2] indicate that the described Knudsen effusion apparatus and methodology is able to produce reproducible and reliable experimental vapour pressure data with an accuracy and quality similar than the achieved in the measurements with low volatile solids. The effect of the improvements on the performance of the Knudsen effusion apparatus was tested and evaluated by the comparison of the vapour pressure results of 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium with the available literature data."}{"Financial time series forecasting model based on CEEMDAN and LSTM ": "In order to improve the accuracy of the stock market prices forecasting, two hybrid forecasting models are proposed in this paper which combine the two kinds of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with the long short-term memory (LSTM). The financial time series is a kind of non-linear and non-stationary random signal, which can be decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions of different time scales by the original EMD and the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). To ensure the effect of historical data onto the prediction result, the LSTM prediction models are established for all each characteristic series from EMD and CEEMDAN deposition. The final prediction results are obtained by reconstructing each prediction series. The forecasting performance of the proposed models is verified by linear regression analysis of the major global stock market indices. Compared with single LSTM model, support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and other hybrid models, the experimental results show that the proposed models display a better performance in one-step-ahead forecasting of financial time series."}{"Bitcoin technical trading with artificial neural network ": "This paper explores Bitcoin intraday technical trading based on artificial neural networks for the return prediction. In particular, our deep learning method successfully discovers trading signals through a seven layered neural network structure for given input data of technical indicators, which are calculated by the past time-series data over every 15\u00a0min. Under feasible settings of execution costs, the numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of a buy-and-hold strategy. Especially, our model performs well for a challenging period from December 2017 to January 2018, during which Bitcoin suffers from substantial minus returns. Furthermore, various sensitivity analysis is implemented for the change of the number of layers, activation functions, input data and output classification to confirm the robustness of our approach."}{"SVM and KNN ensemble learning for traffic incident detection ": "Traffic incident detection is a very important research area of intelligent transportation systems. Many methods have obtained good performance in traffic incident detection. However, the robustness of these methods is not satisfactory. Namely, when one method is applied on another data set again, its performance is not always good, even it had obtained good performance on one data set once. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning method to improve the robustness in traffic incident detection. The proposed method trains individual SVM and KNN models firstly. And then, it takes a strategy to combine them for better final output. Experimental results show that the propose method has achieved the best performance among all the compared methods. Also, the ensemble learning strategy in the proposed method has improved the robustness of the individual models."}{"A modeled perovskite solar cell structure with a Cu2O hole-transporting layer enabling over 20% efficiency by low-cost low-temperature processing ": "We introduce Cu2O as a hole-transporting material in perovskite solar cells. Device modeling with a configuration of glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide/ZnO/perovskite/Cu2O/carbon was performed by SCAPS, a solar cell capacitance simulator. The simulation results indicate that the device performance is greatly dependent on the defect densities and thickness of the perovskite absorber. An absorber thickness of 500\u202fnm was optimum for efficient light absorption. The defect states at the perovskite/ZnO interface had a stronger influence on solar cell performance than those at the Cu2O/perovskite interface; therefore, to further improve photovoltaic performance, we should pay particular attention to the perovskite/ZnO interface. Proper interface modification and passivation to lower defect densities of the interface below 1016\u202fcm\u22123 was essential. The impact of acceptor density and hole mobility of the hole-transport layer on device performance further confirmed that Cu2O is a suitable hole-transport layer for perovskite solar cells. Finally, to achieve better photovoltaic performance, a back-contact material with a high work function is very necessary."}{"ZnO rod decorated with Ag nanoparticles for enhanced photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue ": "Silver-zinc oxide nanocomposite (Ag-ZnO nanocomposite) were synthesised with different concentrations of Ag doped to the ZnO for enhance photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. The structures, morphologies, and optical properties of synthesised nanocomposites were characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FRIR), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The average size of the synthesized Ag nanoparticles was around 40\u202fnm and ZnO nanorod were 2\u202f\u03bcm in length and 200\u202fnm in width. The morphological characterization revealed that Ag nanoparticles were well doped with the ZnO rod surface. The performance and stability of the nanocomposites for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation were evaluated. The overall results suggested that, 6% of Ag nanoparticles achieved better degradation than compare to the other concentrations and bare ZnO. This work provides a simple and effective route to prepare Ag-ZnO nanocomposite for effective degradation of methylene blue. Therefore, Ag-ZnO nanocomposite can be regarded as a potential candidate for application in the treatment of waste water."}{"Removal of tetracycline by BiOBr microspheres with oxygen vacancies: Combination of adsorption and photocatalysis ": "Oxygen vacancy-containing BiOBr microspheres with dual functions of adsorption-photocatalysis were synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). BiOBr microspheres with oxygen vacancies exhibited a higher adsorptive and photocatalytic activity for the removal of tetracycline (TC) than that of defect-deficient BiOBr microspheres. After adsorption for 30\u202fmin and visible light irradiation for 90\u202fmin, about 94% of TC was removed by oxygen vacancy-containing BiOBr microspheres, and TC removal efficiency performed effectively in a wide pH range from 3.1 to 11.00. Almost all inorganic anions, such as Cl\u2212, SO2\u2212 4, PO3\u2212 4, CO2\u2212 3and NO\u2212 3, inhibited the removal of TC by BiOBr microspheres and their inhibition effects followed the order of PO3\u2212 4\u202f>\u202fSO2\u2212 4\u202f>\u202fCO2\u2212 3\u202f>\u202fCl\u2212>NO\u2212 3. The surface hydroxyl groups had no effect on TC adsorption, and the adsorption of TC on BiOBr was mainly through the anion exchange process. The existence of oxygen vacancies facilitated the generation of superoxide radicals (O2\n                     \u2212\u2022), which were the dominant reactive oxygen species for TC degradation in BiOBr suspension. The adsorptive and photocatalytic performance of oxygen vacancy-containing BiOBr decreased to different degrees after three cycles mainly due to the formation of surface complex."}{"VSe2-reduced graphene oxide as efficient cathode material for field emission ": "Field emission properties of pristine VSe2 and its hybrid with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) have been investigated in detail. Promising field emission performance were noted with lower values of turn-on and threshold fields of \u223c1.3\u202fV\u202f\u03bcm\u22121 and 2.12\u202fV\u202f\u03bcm\u22121 respectively for the VSe2/RGO hybrid which is much more superior than that of pristine VSe2 emitter and other 2D materials. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations have also been performed to qualitatively support our experimental observations through demonstration of Density of States and computation of work function for pristine VSe2 and hybrid VSe2/RGO. The lowering of work function and appearance of additional states near Fermi level from carbon p orbital of RGO is responsible for superior field emission characteristics in hybrid VSe2/RGO compared to pristine VSe2 which supports our experimental observations. Our experimental data and theoretical insight from electronic structure simulations strongly infer that the synthesized hybrid VSe2/RGO has the potential to be tailored as efficient and high performance cathode material in field emission based devices."}{"Possible structural transformation and enhanced magnetic fluctuations in exfoliated \u03b1-RuCl3\n             ": "We present Raman spectroscopy experiments on exfoliated \u03b1-RuCl3, from tens of nm thick down to single layers. Besides unexpectedly finding this material to be air stable, in the thinnest layers we observe the appearance with decreasing temperature of a symmetry-forbidden mode in crossed polarization, along with an anomalous broadening of a mode at 164\u202fcm\u22121 that is known to couple to a continuum of magnetic excitations. This may be due to an enhancement of magnetic fluctuations and evidence for a distorted honeycomb lattice in single- and bilayer samples."}{"Thermodynamics with the Gr\u00fcneisen parameter: Fundamentals and applications to high pressure physics and geophysics ": "The Gr\u00fcneisen parameter, \u03b3, conventionally written as a dimensionless combination of familiar properties, expansion coefficient, bulk modulus, density and specific heat, can also be presented in terms of elastic moduli and their pressure derivatives, providing a quantitative link between thermal and mechanical parameters.

A nitrifying-enriched activated sludge (NAS) was obtained in this study through particular ammonium feeding of conventional activated sludge (CAS). Next, the dominance of autotrophic nitrifier population in NAS system was checked and compared with CAS system by its high nitrification efficiency (100% vs. 43%) and low COD removal (9% vs. 65%). Furthermore, the maximum amount of N-NO3\n                     \u2212 produced from similar concentrations of ammonium in CAS and NAS systems were 6.6\u202fmg/L and 37.5\u202fmg/L, respectively. A filterability test also was done in the cross-flow and simple dead-end filtration systems proportionally employing different amount of NAS and CAS with a constant MLSS concentration of 2000\u202fmg/L. NAS was twice as filterable compared to CAS. Soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in CAS were significantly higher than NAS system (2 and 6\u202fmg/L for NAS vs.100 and 36\u202fmg/L for CAS). By increasing the proportion of nitrifying bacteria, the permeation was enhanced remarkably about 2.5 folds and the operation time of MBR was approximately doubled (6\u201311.5\u202fh). The results indicated that an appropriate C/N ratio can control the microbial population and help the nitrifier significantly mitigate fouling in MBR."}{"Treatment of textile wastewater by a hybrid ultrafiltration/electrodialysis process ": "Conventional treatment of textile wastewater is generally based on physical-chemical treatment. Although the effluents from this can be discharged directly there is an increasing interest in industrial wastewater reuse. The present study is based on the investigation of the performance of a hybrid ultrafiltration/electrodialysis process for the removal of COD, salt, and color. Effects of temperature and intrinsic resistances were analyzed to study the ultrafiltration process. The ultrafiltration process was then integrated with electrodialysis (ED) for the treatment of Primary treated textile wastewater (PTTW) and was found that the hybrid process was capable of promoting the quality of the treated textile wastewater. In case of treated textile by UF with a ceramic membrane, ED process was effectiveness where the removal efficiency of TDS and conductivity were 94.2, 97.1% respectively corresponds to conductivity value of 0.450\u2009mS/Cm at 25\u2009min.

In this context, this work aims to compare six different cumene production plants, namely conventional, transalkylation, heat-integrated, dividing wall column, reactive distillation and double-effect distillation technologies, with regard to their economics and environmental efficiencies. The economic analysis was performed by estimating their respective Gross Annual Profit (GAP) and determining the specific production costs indicator, whereas the environmental assessment was carried out by calculating seven eco-indicators, namely raw materials consumption, fuel consumption, energy use, CO2 emissions, water consumption, specific production costs and wastewater generation.

Among these structures, open-cell foams are considered as one of the most promising candidates as catalyst supports. In this work, we investigated the heat transfer in the solid matrix of open-cell foams by means of 3D numerical simulations carried out on virtually reconstructed structures. The totally interconnected solid matrix promotes high heat transfer rates because the conduction in the solid matrix is the main contribution to the heat transport. Our analysis reveals that the void fraction is the controlling parameter for the performances of the structures. An engineering correlation for the effective solid thermal conductivity has been derived, enabling a rational design of the foam geometry. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of the ratio between the node and strut diameters. We found that it has a strong influence on the heat conduction performance. High ratios penalize the heat transfer due to the reduced strut cross-section area at fixed porosity. On the other hand, an advanced design with a node-to-strut diameter ratio close to one can enhance the effective heat conductivity of open-cell foams up to 30%, improving the reactor performances compared to conventional open-cell foams."}{"Process intensification for pharmaceutical crystallization ": "Process intensification (PI) provides great opportunities to drastically improve the performance of chemical processes within many branches of chemical industry including the pharmaceutical industry.

Silica ore was used as the test material. The experimental parameters that were kept constant in this investigation was the grinding media filling, powder filling and the mill rotational speed. The data obtained from these batch tests was then analyzed using a model free technique called the Attainable Region method. This analysis technique showed that the required product fineness is a function of grinding media and feed material size distributions. It was also observed from the experimental results that in order to increase the milling efficiency of a ball mill, towards optimum production of material in the desired size class, there is a need to correlate the ball size and the feed size distributions."}{"The effect of NaOH catalyst concentration and extraction time on the yield and properties of Citrullus vulgaris seed oil as a potential biodiesel feed stock ": "In this work, oil was extracted from Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) seeds for potential feedstock in biodiesel production.

The effect of the saw dust concentration and the molasses concentration was investigated through measuring the briquette's calorific value, fixed carbon, compressive strength and shatter index. Addition of Ca(OH)2 was done to effect removal of sulphur from the briquette. Measurements of the briquettes physicochemical properties such as moisture content, ash content and sulphur content were measured using the standard methods. As the saw dust and the molasses concentration increased, the calorific value, fixed carbon and compressive strength increased by 16%, 8% and 50% respectively. Whereas, the shatter index decreased by 146% as the saw dust and the molasses concentration increased in relation to the coal fines. Addition of the saw dust and the molasses are therefore critical in the production of a high quality coal-saw dust-molasses briquette which does not shatter."}{"Role of vortex finder depth on pressure drop and performance efficiency in a ribbed hydrocyclone ": "Hydrocyclones are devices used in many chemical and mineral based process industries for separation of fine particles.

In the present study, the effects of spiral rib on pressure drop and separation efficiency are investigated experimentally and effect of vortex finder depth of a ribbed hydrocyclone was analyzed. The experimental results showed that the spiral rib has a significant effect on pressure drop and separation efficiency. It is interesting to note that by using a rib in the cylindrical part of the hydrocyclone resulted in lower pressure drop and improved separation efficiency. The pressure drop decreases by 17.5% and total efficiency increases by 10.5% at a feed velocity of 5\u202fm/s and at a vortex finder depth of 7.6\u202fcm. Pressure drop and separation efficiency also affected by the vortex finder depth.

Chlorella vulgaris was very effective in reduction of chemical concentrations (COD, NO3\u00af, SO4\u00af, and PO4\u00af) in SWW along with flue gas (CO2, NOx and SOx). COD removal was achieved up to 78% in batch mode and 42% in continuous mode. The other nutrients from the sewage wastewater were removed up to 75% whereas, with continuous mode 55%. Concerning the flue gas treatment studies, Chlorella vulgaris removed CO2 up to 64% in batch mode and when grown in continuous mode it was up to 72%. The SOx and NOx concentrations were reduced up to 62% and 63% respectively in batch mode and the removal efficiencies of the same were 59% and 55% in continuous mode. Both batch and continuous mode showed the maximum biomass productivity in hetero and mixotrophic cultivations. While average biomass productivity in mixotrophic continuous mode was higher as 1.0\u202fg/L. Fourier infrared spectroscopy examination of algal biomass revealed the presence of \u2013OH, \u2013COOH, NH2, and\u202f=\u202fO organic compound groups. It was concluded from the results that C.\u00a0vulgaris was very effective in the treatment of SWW and industrial flue gas on the other hand the biomass obtained is a sustainable green energy source."}{"Bio ethanol from sewage sludge: A bio fuel alternative ": "In this study, the potential to fully exploit sewage sludge as a raw material for bio ethanol a source of bio fuel is investigated. Sewage sludge hydrolysate was first made by introducing Bacillus flexus in order for saccharification to take place before fermenting to bio ethanol using yeast. The hydrolysate was then prepared for fermentation by introducing 10\u202fg/L of peptone, 2\u202fg/L of KH2PO4 and 1\u202f\u202fg/L of MgSO4. Afterwards, fermentation was allowed to take place at varying pH (4.0\u20137.0), temperature (15\u201345\u202f\u00b0C), incubation time (10\u201370\u202fh) and yeast concentrations (2\u201310% (v/v). Bio ethanol concentrations were characterized through spectrophotometry and its physicochemical properties analyzed by standard methods. Pearson Correlations Coefficients in MATLAB 13.0 were used to determine the coefficients of interaction between the various parameters in bio ethanol production at 95% confidence interval. Highest bio ethanol yields of greater than 40 mL/L were achieved at an incubation period of 10 days, with an operating temperature of 30\u202f\u00b0C and pH of 6.5 with yeast concentration of 6% wt. The interactions between incubation temperature and pH had the best interaction coefficient of 0.9759 being achieved for optimal bio ethanol yield. The bio ethanol produced had a flash point of 19.2\u202f\u00b0C, pour point of 4.9\u202f\u00b0C, cloud point of 20\u202f\u00b0C and viscosity of 1.30\u202fcP."}{"Simple method for functionalization of silica with alkyl silane and organic ligands ": "3\u2013(chloropropyl)triethoxysilane (CPTES) with imidazole and sodium silicate from rice husk ash (RHA) successfully reacted within a short time in one\u2013pot synthesis in purely homogenous method. A similar procedure was used for the immobilization of melamine and saccharine to demonstrate a generally applicable method. No reflux was needed, and a green solvent was used as the reaction medium. The surface areas of the prepared materials were very high compared with the materials which have similar structure prepared by the traditional method. The TGA/DTA confirmed that all the materials were highly stable. The FT-IR shows that all expected the functional groups were present. The HRTEM showed that the materials had ordered mesoporous straight-channels which were like the MCM-41. The synthesis procedure is simple, repeatable with different organic ligands and does not require toxic solvents or multiple steps with high products yield."}{"Comparative study of various carbon sources on rhamnolipid production ": "This study aimed at comparing the effect of various carbon sources with a fixed nitrogen source for the syntheses of rhamnolipid biosurfactant using a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The carbon sources used were glycerol, glucose and waste cooking oil (WCO), for the benefit of utilising wastes. The characterized microbial strain was obtained from the Microbiology Department of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. It was grown on a surface culture before inoculation into a production culture. Each culture media were sterilized at 121\u202f\u00b0C, 15 psi for 15\u202fmin and cooled before inoculation. Each procedure was carried out in duplicates and culture flasks incubated in a shaker for 7 days with 24-h monitoring. The growth of P. aeruginosa on the three carbon sources passed through the phases of formation of primary metabolites. The surface tensions of medium relative to water was reduced from 86.69\u202fmNm\u22121 to 33.63\u202fmNm\u22121, 36.44\u202fmNm\u22121 and 18.02\u202fmNm\u22121 for biosurfactant from use of glycerol, glucose and WCO as carbon sources respectively. Excellent emulsification index, E24, was obtained in the continuous media Heavy black oil and lubricating oil unlike in the other media: vegetable oil and kerosene. The FTIR spectra revealed that the glycerol- and glucose-based biosurfactants were di-substituted rhamnolipids with difference in the hydrophobic moieties. However, the biosurfactant formed with WCO was not a rhamnolipid but a lipopeptide."}{"The formation of astrophysical Mg-rich silicate dust ": "We present new results for ground-state candidate energies of Mg-rich olivine (MRO) clusters and use the binding energies of these clusters to determine their nucleation rates in stellar outflows, with particular interest in the environments of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Low-lying structures of clusters (Mg2SiO4)\n                        n\n                      2\u202f\u2264\u202fn\u202f\u2264\u202f13 are determined from a modified minima hopping algorithm using an empirical silicate potential in the Buckingham form. These configurations are further refined and optimized using the density functional theory code Quantum Espresso. Utilizing atomistic nucleation theory, we determine the critical size and nucleation rates of these clusters. We find that configurations and binding energies in this regime are very dissimilar from those of the bulk lattice. Clusters grow with SiO4\u2013MgO layering and exhibit only global, rather than local, symmetries. When compared to classical nucleation theory we find suppressed nucleation rates at most temperatures and pressures, with enhanced nucleation rates at very large pressures. This implies a slower progression of silicate dust formation in stellar environments than previously assumed."}{"Formation of acetamide in interstellar medium ": "Acetamide (C2H5NO) is the largest molecule containing a peptide bond, which is an amine (-NH2) group bonded to a carbonyl (C\u202f=\u202fO) group, that has yet been detected in interstellar medium (ISM). It is also considered to be a precursor for amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). Formation of acetamide in ISM is believed to occur due based on evidence for the existence of the molecule itself and its component smaller species in ISM. A case study of acetamide is presented here, to introduce a new method to determine its possible formation reaction pathways in ISM based on the molecular formula of a species. All possible species with the same molecular formula as acetamide (C2H5NO) but with different connectivity, the so-called constitutional isomers of the molecule (198 structures, 91 unique species), were created and studied under the extreme conditions of dense molecular clouds. Acetamide was found to be the most stable of the C2H5NO isomer family. Based on the stability of the uni- and bimolecular species, eight reactions were proposed which could led to the formation of acetamide in ISM."}{"Catalytic conversion of methanol to larger organic molecules over crystalline forsterite: Laboratory study and astrophysical implications ": "Laboratory catalytic reactions of methanol over heated crystalline silicates (forsterite) lead to the formation of gas-phase olefinic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules, and are of potential importance in astrophysical environments including hot molecular cores, protoplanetary disks and shocks. In our experiments the methanol reagent, together with intermediate and product gas-phase molecular species were detected using time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (TOF-MS). A solid deposited on the crystalline forsterite surface was examined subsequently using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and thermal gravimetric techniques and found to comprise amorphous and graphitic carbon. The chemical players in this work \u2013 gas-phase methanol, crystalline silicates and PAHs, have been identified spectroscopically in a range of astrophysical environments including young and evolved stars, protoplanetary disks, comets, captured dust particles and meteorites. It is envisaged that reactions on bare dust grains as studied here both experimentally and theoretically through DFT calculations, can have implications for chemical transformations and conversions, in forming PAH molecules and potentially in the synthesis of prebiotic molecules."}{"First-principles study of the formation of glycine-producing radicals from common interstellar species ": "Glycine, the simplest amino acid, has been intensively searched for in molecular clouds, and the comprehensive clarification of the formation path of interstellar glycine is now imperative. Among all the possible glycine formation pathways, we focused on the radical pathways revealed by Garrod (2013). In the present study, we have precisely investigated all the chemical reaction steps related to the glycine formation processes based on state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that two reaction pathways require small activation barriers (\u0394E\u2021\n                     \u202f\u2264\u202f7.75\u00a0kJ mol\u20131), which demonstrates the possibility of glycine formation even at low temperatures in interstellar space if the radical species are generated. The origin of carbon and nitrogen in the glycine backbone and their combination patterns are further discussed in relation to the formation mechanisms. According to the clarification of the atomic correspondence between glycine and its potential parental molecules, it is shown that the nitrogen and two carbons in the glycine can originate in three common interstellar molecules, methanol, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia, and that the source molecules of glycine can be described by any of their combinations. The glycine formation processes can be categorized into six patterns. Finally, we discussed two other glycine formation pathways expected from the present DFT calculation results."}{"Polarizability of isomeric and related interstellar compounds in the aspect of their abundance ": "Currently, about 100 carbon-containing molecules have been detected in interstellar and circumstellar environments, and this list includes isomeric substances. In most cases, the minimum energy principle is able to explain the ratio of abundances of the isomeric compounds but in some cases is not. Trying to rationalize the questions unsolved within the energetic approach, we have theoretically studied the polarizability of isomeric and related compounds detected or proposed in interstellar conditions. As we found, in general both energy and polarizability provide the consistent estimates for the ratio of the isomers (e.g., for the isomers having generic formulae CHO, CHN, C3H, C3H2, CHNO, C2H3N, C2H6O, etc.). In the case of the C4H3N isomers, the most abundant isomer (cyanoallene) is not the most stable but the least polarizable that is in a good agreement with relevant experimental study. We assume that the efficiency of the use of polarizability is due to its relevance to the molecules\u2019 response to the external electric fields, i.e., more polarizable molecules are more responsive, more reactive, and, hence, less abundant. Further, we have analyzed the polarizabilities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, fullerene hydrides (fulleranes), polyynes, and their derivatives with respect to their possible detection under interstellar conditions."}{"A theoretical investigation of the reaction between the amidogen, NH, and the ethyl, C2H5, radicals: a possible gas-phase formation route of interstellar and planetary ethanimine ": "The reaction between the amidogen, NH, radical and the ethyl, C2H5, radical has been investigated by performing electronic structure calculations of the underlying doublet potential energy surface. Rate coefficients and product branching ratios have also been estimated by combining capture and RRKM calculations. According to our results, the reaction is very fast, close to the gas-kinetics limit. However, the main product channel, with a yield of ca. 86\u201388% in the range of temperatures investigated, is the one leading to methanimine and the methyl radical. The channels leading to the two E-, Z- stereoisomers of ethanimine account only for ca. 5\u20137% each. The resulting ratio [E-CH3CHNH]/[Z-CH3CHNH] is ca. 1.2, that is a value rather lower than that determined in the Green Bank Telescope PRIMOS radio astronomy survey spectra of Sagittarius B2 North (ca. 3). Considering that ice chemistry would produce essentially only the most stable isomer, a possible conclusion is that the observed [E-CH3CHNH]/[Z-CH3CHNH] ratio is compatible with a combination of gas-phase and grain chemistry. More observational and laboratory data are needed to definitely address this issue."}{"Providing theoretical data for detection of four formamidic acid isomers in astrophysical media ": "We present a theoretical study, so that molecular data (geometrical parameters, vibrational frequencies, infrared intensities, electronic energies, enthalpies, and Gibbs energies) of four formamidic acid (FA) isomers (labeled here as FA1, FA2, FA3, and FA4) and formamide (HCONH2) are obtained from CCSD/cc-pVTZ, CCSD/aug-cc-pVTZ, CCSD/cc-pVQZ, and CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ calculations. Furthermore, on the basis of insufficient or even lacking theoretical and experimental results in the literature, we employed the aforementioned theory levels to determine benchmark values of dipole moments and rotational constants for these four FA isomers in order to contribute for their detection in astrophysical environments. Besides, we provide for the first time data about forward and reverse rate constants (200\u20134000\u202fK) and Arrhenius\u2019 parameters for each interconversion reaction between pairs of FA isomers as well as for the tautomeric process involving FA4 and formamide, which were calculated from a Complete Basis Set (CBS) extrapolation equation obtained at CCSD/cc-pVTZ optimized geometries. Our kinetic analysis indicated a faster interconversion between the FA structures in comparison with the FA4 \u2194 HCONH2 process, suggesting that these isomers could co-exist in astrophysical media. Finally, we estimated that these isomers may be detected with relative abundances, [FA\n                        x\n                     ]/[HCONH2] (x\u202f=\u202f1, 2, 3, and 4), between \u223c0.01 and \u223c0.1% in astrophysical sources at chemical equilibrium conditions and temperatures around 1000\u202fK. However, these ratios can become as high as \u223c1, \u223c3, and \u223c5%, respectively, in hotter regions with temperatures around 2000, 3000, and 4000\u202fK (expected, for example, in massive star-forming regions)."}{"Ro-vibrational analysis of SiO in UV-irradiated environments ": "SiO emission lines are important probes of chemical processes in diverse astrophysical environments, commonly observed in shocks associated with the outflows of young stellar objects, both low- and high-mass, and in the envelopes of evolved stars. Modelling SiO emission for conditions of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) requires collisional rate coefficients due to H2, H, and He impact, with the first of these of limited availability. Unknown collisional rate coefficients are often estimated from known systems. For the case of SiO-H2, rate coefficients have previously been adapted from a different collider, He, based on a reduced-mass scaling approach. Here, we construct comprehensive SiO collisional rate coefficients data with multiple colliders (H2, He and H) and rovibrational transitions up to \n                        \n                           v\n                           =\n                           5\n                        \n                      and \n                        \n                           J\n                           =\n                           39\n                        \n                     .

These BDC, which are energy dependent dissociation branching ratios (BR) curves, were used to predict products branching ratios for various processes leading to the formation of C2N(+) and C3N(+) excited adducts. These processes, of astrochemical interest, are neutral-neutral and ion-molecule reactions, dissociative recombination and charge transfer reactions with He+. Model predictions of BR are compared to the literature data and to reported values in the kinetic database for astrochemistry KIDA. With the new BR values, the CnN abundances in cold cores were simulated."}{"Transmission spectroscopy with the ACE-FTS infrared spectral atlas of Earth: A model validation and feasibility study ": "Infrared solar occultation measurements are well established for remote sensing of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and the corresponding primary transit spectroscopy has turned out to be valuable for characterization of extrasolar planets. Our objective is an assessment of the detectability of molecular signatures in Earth\u2019s transit spectra.\n                  To this end, we take a limb sequence of representative cloud-free transmission spectra recorded by the space-borne ACE-FTS Earth observation mission (Hughes et\u00a0al., ACE infrared spectral atlases of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, JQSRT 2014) and combine these spectra to the effective height of the atmosphere. These data are compared to spectra modeled with an atmospheric radiative transfer line-by-line infrared code to study the impact of individual molecules, spectral resolution, the choice of auxiliary data, and numerical approximations. Moreover, the study serves as a validation of our infrared radiative transfer code.\n                  The largest impact is due to water, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen, nitric acid, oxygen, and some chlorofluorocarbons (CFC11 and CFC12). The effect of further molecules considered in the modeling is either marginal or absent. The best matching model has a mean residuum of 0.4\u2009km and a maximum difference of 2\u2009km to the measured effective height. For a quantitative estimate of visibility and detectability we consider the maximum change of the residual spectrum, the relative change of the residual norm, the additional transit depth, and signal-to-noise ratios for a JWST setup. In conclusion, our study provides a list of molecules that are relevant for modeling transmission spectra of Earth-like exoplanets and discusses the feasibility of retrieval."}{"Active packaging films as a carrier of black cumin essential oil: Development and effect on quality and shelf-life of chicken breast meat ": "Fabrication of active PET films assembled with antimicrobial chitosan and alginate coatings incorporating black cumin oil(BCO) was performed by layer-by-layer(LbL) technique and effect of active packaging film on quality and shelf-life of chicken breast meats stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 5 days was investigated. Multilayer films were characterized in terms of surface morphology, color, thickness, and antimicrobial activity. Incorporation of BCO into film demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and spherical particles on surface profile. Changes in weight loss, color, pH, total aerobic mesophilic(TAMC), and psychrotrophic bacteria counts(PBC) of chicken meat, packaged in trays containing antimicrobial films, were observed. Increase in pH values was higher in control samples than samples packaged with antimicrobial film during storage. Samples stored in active packaging had slightly lower TAMC and PBC compared to control samples. Results indicated that active film containing BCO has the potential to maintain safety and quality of chicken meat."}{"Investigation into the release of nanomaterials from can coatings into food ": "In this study internal and seam covering coatings as used in food cans were investigated on their potential to release nanomaterials (pigments, fillers) when food is stored and processed (sterilised) within coated cans. Two interior lacquers based on epoxy- and polyester- (with and without bisphenol A) resins and two seam covering coatings were used as lacquer matrices covering typical lacquer formulations. Eight different nanomaterials (four pigments and four fillers) were investigated that are typically used for adjusting colour and enhancing thermal and mechanical stability of the coatings. Aqueous sodium dodecylsulfate surfactant solution showed best suitability to disperse the nanomaterials with sufficient stability. A stable multi-nanomaterial dispersion, containing all eight nanomaterials at the same concentration each, was successfully used to develop an analytical method based on asymmetric flow filed-flow fractionation (AF4) coupled with multi angle laser light scattering (MALLS) detection and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) that allowed screening for possibly migrating nanomaterials at a limit of detection of 0.5\u202fmg/dm2. Coated metal plates were brought in contact with the aqueous surfactant solution as alternative food simulant for 2\u202fh at 130\u202f\u00b0C (sterilisation) followed by for 10\u202fdays at 60\u202f\u00b0C (long-term storage). Via AF4/MALLS measurements the release of small oligomeric components from internal coating formulations was detected. However, the particle- and element-specific detection system demonstrated the none-migration of nanomaterials (fillers or pigments) from all test samples."}{"Utilization of mango peel extracts on the biodegradable films for active packaging ": "Mango peels extract (MPE) was incorporated into fish gelatin films to determine their physical, barrier, mechanical and antioxidant properties for active food packaging. Films with three different concentrations of MPE (1\u20135%) were prepared by solution casting method. Films incorporated with MPE showed a decrease (P\u202f>\u202f0.05) of water vapor permeability (WVP) and lower (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05) films solubility. High level of MPE films also exhibited more rigid and less flexible film formation. Colored tint films and a reduction in transparency were due to the hydrogen bond linkages between fish gelatin molecules and phenolic content within the film matrix. Higher free radicals scavenging activities also observed for films with higher concentrations of MPE. This study reveals the benefits of mango by-products incorporated into gelatin based films as a potential material for active packaging."}{"Moringa oil/chitosan nanoparticles embedded gelatin nanofibers for food packaging against Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus on cheese ": "The current study aims to prepare moringa oil-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (MO@CNPs) and fabricate MO@CNPs embedded gelatin nanofibers for biocontrol of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus on cheese. The optimal MO@CNPs were prepared by the ionic crosslinking method with the concentration of moringa oil at 20\u2009mg/mL and chitosan at 3.0\u2009mg/mL. The nanoparticle exhibited desirable particle size, PDI and zeta potential. Furthermore, the optimal concentration of MO@CNPs embedded in gelatin nanofibers was found to be 9.0\u2009mg/mL after the determination of nanofiber physical properties. The results of SEM and AFM confirmed that the nanofibers were prepared successfully and achieved uniform diameter at 142.5\u2009nm. The release rate of moringa oil from the nanoparticles declined due to the encapsulation of nanofibers. For the application on cheese, MO@CNPs nanofibers possessed high antibacterial activity against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus at 4\u2009\u00b0C and 25\u2009\u00b0C for 10 days, without any effect on the sensory quality of cheese. As a result, MO@CNPs nanofibers could be a promising active food packaging material for food preservation."}{"Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of carbohydrate-based films enriched with cinnamon essential oil by Pickering emulsion method ": "The overall aim of this research is to introduce a novel approach for maintaining a greater amount of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) in the material. We used the Pickering stabilization method, in order to increase the antioxidant and antifungal properties of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based films. The light transmission, antioxidant and antifungal properties of the films were studied. In addition, the effect of the packaging was studied on the shelf life of bread. The results showed great improvement of the antifungal and antioxidant properties of the prepared films. The films containing 1.5 and 3% CEO were highly effective against P. digitatum and showed complete inhibition in in vitro and in vivo tests. Moreover, the films exhibited a good UV inhibitory effect. Consequently, the CEO Pickering emulsion was an ideal alternative for incorporation with CMC-PVA based films for increasing the shelf life of bread."}{"A freshness indicator for monitoring chicken-breast spoilage using a Tyvek\u00ae sheet and RGB color analysis ": "In this study, a simple, inexpensive, and high-confidence freshness indicator was developed to detect chicken-breast spoilage using a pH-sensitive dye, bromocresol green (BCG); color changes in the freshness indicator were analyzed using RGB digital images. The indicator consisted of a three-layered structure, using a Tyvek\u00ae sheet with high gas and vapor permeability as the inner layer, BCG-immobilized with the binding polymer as the color-changing layer, and a low-density polyethylene film as the outer layer. Color changes in the indicator were correlated with CO2 and total volatile basic nitrogen contents and bacterial growth in the chicken breast, which were quantified using digital images captured on a smartphone. When the indicator turned yellow from green, it indicated spoilage; further, a large difference was observed in the RGB values. The proposed freshness indicator with no dye migration is highly feasible, safe, and reliable for the real-time monitoring of quality changes in chicken breasts. Digital image processing via a smartphone makes it a simple and accurate method, allowing consumers to judge food quality easily and reliably."}{"Aqueous hibiscus extract as a potential natural pH indicator incorporated in natural polymeric films ": "Intelligent packaging system was developed based on natural polymeric films (chitosan, gelatin and starch), containing bioactive compounds from aqueous hibiscus extract (HAE). Anthocyanin, a compound present on HAE, changes colour under different pH conditions. Thus, the application of HAE as a natural pH indicator with visible colour variation incorporated into renewable materials to allow for simple, economic, and easy disposal, can be considered an invocation in the area of intelligent packaging system. Films containing HAE (25\u2009g/100\u2009g of filmogenic dispersion, intelligent films) were produced by casting using 2\u2009g of starch, gelatin or chitosan/100\u2009g of filmogenic dispersion and 30\u2009g of sorbitol/100\u2009g of macromolecules. These films were characterized by the colour change at different pH values (from 2.2 to 8.0 and 13.0), water content, total soluble matter, light barrier properties and morphological structure. Intelligent films presented homogeneous surfaces without visible defects. The colour variation of intelligent films was visibly observed and completely dependent on pH. This was associated with the presence of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds in HAE. The addition of HAE in the films provoked a significant increase in the water content. A significant increase was observed only for the starch film for total soluble matter. The gelatin films presented a barrier to light. The proposed device could be used as an alternative natural pH indicator in intelligent packaging systems."}{"A new active nanocomposite film based on PLA/ZnO nanoparticle/essential oils for the preservation of refrigerated Otolithes ruber fillets ": "In the current study, the active packaging films based on poly lactic acid (PLA) containing 1.5% w/w zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles and varying concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5% w/w) of Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil (ZEO) and Menthe piperita L. essential oil (MEO) were produced. The efficacies of the resulted active films on shelf life extension of Otolithes ruber fish during 16 days of refrigerated storage (4\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C) were evaluated. The antibacterial activity of the films was tested against five common food-borne pathogens (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) by disc diffusion method. The fillet samples were analyzed periodically for microbiological (aerobic count, Enterobacteriaceae count, Pseudomonas spp., Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) count and H2S-producing bacteria) and chemical (TBARS and TVB-N). PLA/ZnO/ZEO and PLA/ZnO/MEO films showed enhanced antibacterial (691 and 513.33\u2009mm2, repectively, against S. aureus) and antioxidant (69.14 and 49.08%, repectively) activity than control. Based on the microbial count, the active films significantly increased the shelf life of fillets from 8 to 16 days. The lowest TBARS (0.8\u2009mg MA/kg muscle) and TVB-N (21.23\u2009mg/100\u2009g muccle) values were obtained in fillets wrapped with PLA/ZnO containing 1.5% ZEO. Carvacrol and menthone were found to be the main compounds of ZEO and MEO following GC analysis, respectively. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer showed transfer only a minuscule amount of Zn2+ ions to the meat. Overally, the PLA/ZnO films containing the essential oils could be deemed as a potential alternative to the current common technologies for extending the shelf-life of meat products like \u2018Otolithes ruber fillets."}{"Biodegradable and active nanocomposite pouches reinforced with silver nanoparticles for improved packaging of chicken sausages ": "This study reports the development of biodegradable PVA-montmorillonite K10 clay nanocomposite blend films with in situ generated ginger extract mediated silver nanoparticles. Photo-assisted method using sunlight irradiation was adopted for the rapid and eco-friendly in situ generation of ginger extract mediated silver nanoparticles in the composite. FTIR, XRD and SEM analysis were conducted to confirm the generation of AgNPs. The nanocomposite blend film had clear antimicrobial activity against common food borne pathogens S. Typhimurium and S. aureus. It also had superior mechanical properties, water resistivity and light barrier ability compared to control films. Indoor soil burial test revealed the nanocomposite blend would degrade completely within 110 days. The nanocomposite blend film was then fabricated into novel packaging pouches and found to be highly efficient in reducing the microbial burden in chicken sausage samples, compared to control polyethylene pouches, signifying its potentiality in extending the shelf life of chicken meat products."}{"Effect of poly(lactic acid) films incorporated with different concentrations of Tanacetum balsamita essential oil, propolis ethanolic extract and cellulose nanocrystals on shelf life extension of vacuum-packed cooked sausages ": "The objective of the present research was to evaluate the effect of the poly)lactic acid(composite films combined with cellulose nanocrystals composite (CNC), Tanacetum balsamita (L.) essential oil (TBE) and propolis ethanolic extract (PEE) on shelf life extension of vacuum-packed cooked sausages. The The addition of CNC significantly increased the mechanical properties of PLA composite and this effect more pronounced with PEE and TBE. The in vitro inhibitory effects of PLA films were significantly affected by the addition of TBE (p\u2009<\u20090.05), while PLA films containing only PEE and/or CNC could not inhibit the growth of bacteria. It was found that the Gram positive bacteria were more susceptible to the active PLA films than the Gram negatives, and B. cereus is the most sensitive bacteria to films containing TBE and PEE. All films containing TBE showed significant antibacterial effects against APC, LAB and psychrotroph compared to PLA as control sample (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, the PLA composite with pure PEE and CNC had no significant effect on the aforementioned microbial populations (p\u2009>\u20090.05). The findings of this work purpose that the use of TBE and PEE in PLA matrix might be an emerging platform for antimicrobial packaging development."}{"Nano silica-carbon-silver ternary hybrid induced antimicrobial composite films for food packaging application ": "In this work, Ag assisted biobased silica-carbon nanoparticles (SCAg-NPs) were incorporated into a viscous biopolymer solution to fabricate antimicrobial thin films using 3D printing technique. The Ag NPs were prepared in situ from AgNO3 through one-step ball milling in the presence of silica-carbon hybrid obtained from pyrolysis of rice husk. The nanostructure of the SCAg-NPs was determined by XRD and TEM. These as-synthesized particles were also characterized by XPS analysis. The printed films were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, Raman microanalysis, TGA, DSC and tensile testing to investigate the influence of nanoparticles on the thermal and mechanical properties on the films. Antimicrobial testing was carried out on the films to assess the inhibitory effect of SCAg NPs on Salmonella Enteritidis inoculum. XRD, XPS and Raman microanalysis confirmed the incorporation of Ag particles into SCNPs, while FE-SEM size measurement of the SCAg NPs ranged between 10\u2013100\u2009nm in diameter. Thermal analysis revealed that the inclusion of SCAg NPs led to improvement in the thermal stability of the fabricated nanocomposites films. Tensile test was carried out to determine the influence of SCAg NPs on mechanical properties of the films and found moderate increase in the strength of the polymer film."}{"Corn starch and gelatin-based films added with guabiroba pulp for application in food packaging ": "The guabiroba pulp (GP) has natural antioxidant compounds, such as phenolic compounds and ascorbic acid. The aim of this work was to produce an active biodegradable film based on blends of gelatin (GEL) and corn starch (NCS) and activated with GP, for application as package for extra-virgin olive oil, as a sachet. For that, the effect of blends composition was first evaluated in passive films, and then, a formulation was chosen to produce the active film with guabiroba pulp. The effect of the incorporation of GP on the barrier, mechanical and optical properties of these films was studied, and the antioxidant effect on the storage of extra virgin olive oil was verified in a specific test. Blends with GEL (5 and 10%) and NCS (2 and 4%) were prepared, in the different ratios. The film with 5% GEL and 2% NCS in the 1:1 ratio, was selected for the addition of GP (10 and 20%). The addition of GP caused a reduction in tensile strength and increased elongation values. The film with 10% GP was selected for the preparation of the sachet, due to its lower value of water vapor permeability. At the end of the storage period (15 days), the values of acidity index and peroxide index of the extra-virgin olive oil did not reach the maximum limit allowed by the current legislation. It can be concluded that the results obtained may be useful for future studies and applications using active and biodegradable packaging."}{"Antimicrobial poly(lactic acid)/cellulose bionanocomposite for food packaging application: A review ": "Conventional food packaging materials are derived from nonrenewable fossil resources and face difficulties in disposal and recycling. The development of green and ecologically balanced food packaging materials has received much attention as a prospective solution that can partially substitute for the imperishable fossil fuel-derived plastic. Polylactic acid (PLA) is known as a promising biopolymer, and the incorporation of nanocellulose can further enhance the properties of this biopolymer. The combination of PLA and nanocellulose enables the development of a sustainable eco-friendly food packaging as PLA can be obtained from agricultural resources and nanocellulose can be extracted from agricultural waste. This critical review demonstrates the current developments, and the advantages of PLA and nanocellulose for the purpose of food packaging are introduced.

This work objectives to understand the interactional phenomena between WPI and polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and to evaluate the effect of the addition of up to 30% of PVOH on flexibility, water vapor barrier and solubility in water of WPI films. FT-IR analysis of the blends showed the formation of new interactions and structures, while morphology analysis indicated a possible compatibility between the polymers. The addition of 30% of PVOH provided a more ductile material, increasing nine times the WPI elongation capability, leading to tensile properties close to that from commercial LPDE. PVOH addition did not act reducing puncture resistance or water barrier, but decreased solubility of WPI film in water. It is indicated the addition of 30% of PVOH in WPI matrix in order to improve its flexibility and reduce solubility in water."}{"Methyl orange adsorption comparison on nanoparticles: Isotherm, kinetics, and thermodynamic studies ": "A batch equilibrium system has been used to investigate the adsorption of methyl orange (MO) on NiO and CuO nanoparticles (NPs). The effects of experimental conditions such as initial concentration, agitation time, solution pH and temperature were examined. Langmuir and Freundlich's models were used for determining the adsorption parameters at three different temperatures. It was observed that the Langmuir model fits well with the experimental adsorption data. The pseudo first-order, second-order and intra-particle diffusion models were applied to investigate the kinetic data. The obtained results indicate that experimental kinetics data of NiO and CuO NPs were only well explained by the second-order model. It was found that the adsorption capacities of NiO NPs are higher than that of CuO NPs for each temperature. However, CuO NPs has higher adsorption rate than that of NiO NPs. The thermodynamic parameters (\u0394H\u2070, \u0394S\u2070, and \u0394G\u2070) were determined and their values indicate that the adsorptions of MO on NiO and CuO NPs are endothermic and spontaneous processes. Thermodynamics parameters also confirm that the adsorption of MO is chemical and physical adsorption on the surfaces of NiO and CuO NPs, respectively."}{"A highly selective ESIPT-based fluorescent probe with a large Stokes shift for the turn-on detection of cysteine and its application in living cells ": "A new imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine-based fluorescent probe, named MZC-AC, is developed for the detection of cysteine (Cys) based on an excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) mechanism. The probe MZC-AC uses an acrylate moiety as the ESIPT blocking group as well as the recognition site. Upon the treatment with Cys, MZC-AC exhibits a dramatic fluorescence enhancement (85-fold) and a large Stokes shift (166\u202fnm). The limit of detection obtained from fluorescent titration was as low as 0.07\u202f\u03bcM. MZC-AC displays highly sensitive and selective response to Cys over homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione (GSH). Significantly, MZC-AC could be used to detect Cys in living cells."}{"Synthetic food dyes in electronic cigarettes ": "Apart from nicotine, the identity and levels of the ingredients of electronic cigarette liquids are typically not available to consumers. Herein we have identified and quantified synthetic dye additives used in e-liquids. Tartrazine, Brilliant Blue FCF and Allura Red AC were found in six randomly-chosen commercial e-liquids. They were present in amounts comparable to those of dye concentrations in colored foodstuffs. The synthetic dyes found in the e-liquids are generally recognized as safe for ingestion; however, their inhalation toxicity is unknown. The ongoing treatment of e-liquids as foodstuff, for example via the use of ingredients such as sweeteners, synthetic dyes and related non-volatile additives, may increase appeal as well as potential harm without directly enhancing intended medicinal benefits."}{"Investigation of B-F substitution on BODIPY and aza-BODIPY dyes: Development of B-O and B-C BODIPYs ": "Among the wide-range of chemical reactions that can be performed on BODIPYs, attack on the boron atom opens the door to the synthesis of numerous more or less complex fluorophores. Moreover, the modifications that occur preserve the unique photo-physical properties of while improving their quantum yield, stability and solubility either in water or in organic solvents.

Ultrasound generates acoustic cavitation in a liquid medium, developing physical forces that are considered the main mechanism responsible for changes in exposed materials. In meat, ultrasound has been successfully used to improve processes such as mass transfer and marination, tenderization of meat and inactivation of microorganisms. It is also an alternative to traditional meat ageing methods for improving the quality properties of meat. Moreover, the combination of ultrasonic energy with a sanitizing agent can improve the effect of microbial reduction in foods.

The usage of ultrasound in photocatalysis finds much attention as the combined process offers some advantages over individual processes. Herein, we report the ultrasound assisted photocatalytic degradation of an organic pollutant (methyl orange as a model dye) in the presence of CuO-TiO2/rGO photocatalyst which was prepared by a simple wet impregnation method. A synergistic effect (3.7-fold) was observed by combining the sonolysis and photocatalysis processes. Influence of Cu loading and graphene oxide (GO) dosage over the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 was examined in detail.

Twenty farmers managed the experiment under their prevailing conditions for 30 weeks. Stored grain was assessed for damage every six weeks. The dominant storage insect pests identified were the Maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) and the Red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). The moisture content of grain in hermetic conditions increased from 12.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2% at the start of storage to a range of 13.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u201313.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2% at 30 weeks. There was no significant difference (F\u202f=\u202f87.09; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) regarding insect control and grain damage between hermetic storage and fumigation with insecticides. However, the insecticide treatment of polypropylene yarn (ZeroFly\u00ae) did not control the insect populations for the experimental period under farmers' management. Grain damage was significantly lower in hermetic storage and fumigated grain than ZeroFly\u00ae and polypropylene bags without fumigation. No significant difference in grain damage was found between airtight treatment alone and when combined with the use of insecticides. During storage, S.\u00a0zeamais was predominant and could be of more economic importance than T.\u00a0castaneum as far as maize damage is concerned. At 30 weeks, the germination rate of grain stored with insecticides or in hermetic storage (68.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.6% to 81.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.0%) had not significantly reduced from the rate before storage (F\u202f=\u202f15.55; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) except in ZeroFly\u00ae, also in polypropylene bags without treatment. Even though such bags did not control storage pests, farmers still liked this cheap technology. Hermetic storage techniques can be recommended to farmers without the use of insecticides provided they are inexpensive, and the proper application of technologies is ensured."}{"A time-saving method for sealing Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags ": "Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags were designed to reduce grain storage losses on smallholder farms. The bag consists of three layers: two high-density polyethylene liners fitted inside a woven polypropylene bag. Recently, farmer groups, development relief programs, and government food security agencies have shown interest in PICS bags for large-scale use. PICS bags are conventionally closed by a twist-tie (TT) method, which involves twisting, folding, and tying the lip of each layer individually with a cord. This is not only time and labor intensive, but also may affect the integrity of the liners. We evaluated three new bag closure methods: i) inner liner rolled onto itself and middle liner fold-tied (IR), ii) both liners folded together and tied (FT), and iii) both liners folded and tied separately (FS), along with the conventional twist tie (TT) method. The time to close partially or fully filled 50\u202fkg-capacity PICS bags filled with maize grain was assessed. Results showed that FT was the most time-saving method, reducing bag sealing time by >34% versus the usual TT method. The average internal oxygen levels reached <2% within a week in bags containing grain highly infested with Sitophilus zeamais, while it remained >5% levels for less-infested bags. In both cases, insect population growth was suppressed. Oxygen depletion rates among tying methods remained the same regardless of the closure method used. When large numbers of bags need to be closed, the time-saving FT method is a good alternative PICS sealing method over the conventional twist-tie approach."}{"Analysis of green coffee quality using hermetic bag storage ": "Coffee (Coffea arabica L.) value is highly dependent on quality. However, due to high humidity in the Central Andean Ranges of Colombia, where much of the country's coffee production resides, Farmers must sell their coffee at harvest in order to mitigate quality loss due to the high moisture. Cooperatives are generally forced to store green coffee until enough volume is collected for export, making it crucial to utilize storage solutions that maintain quality over time. This study examines the efficacy of Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) hermetic bags for storage of green coffee in a simulated small farm setting. PICS bags with the standard three layers (PICS3), PICS bags with two layers (PICS2), and Traditional jute sacks were studied. Quality indicators examined were moisture content, water activity, and cupping score. Analysis of coffee stored at monthly intervals over seven months suggests that both versions of PICS show promise in maintaining moisture content, water activity, and sensory scores. Furthermore, the data suggest that water activity is a better indicator of quality than the currently used moisture content and there is no statistically significant difference in performance between the two PICS treatments."}{"Effect of artificial aging on wheat quality deterioration during storage ": "The quality of wheat deteriorates naturally during long-term storage. In this study, to evaluate the quality changes of stored wheat, an artificial aging treatment was applied to accelerate the deterioration of wheat grain. The germination rate, free fatty acid content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and embryo and endosperm microstructures were examined in the wheat cultivars Zhengmai-103 and Zhengmai-379. In both wheat cultivars, seed germination almost completely ceased during storage for 10 months, whereas the contents of free fatty acids and MDA increased significantly. The variance analysis results showed that the accelerated deterioration process had significant effects on the free fatty acid, MDA, and superoxide radical contents. Further, the storage time was well correlated with the germination rate, free fatty acid content, and MDA content, and there was significant correlation between the free fatty acid and MDA contents (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). However, there was no significant correlation between the superoxide radical content, which decreased in the later stages of storage, and the above indicators. Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed that artificial aging resulted in blurring of the interstitial space in the embryo cells of wheat seeds, looser binding between the protein matrix and starch granules in the endosperm, and increased exposure of starch granules, which have some protein fragments on their surfaces. The insights obtained in this study about the quality deterioration of stored wheat can potentially be applied to the development of improved wheat cultivars."}{"Moisture content, insect pest infestation and mycotoxin levels of maize in markets in the northern region of Ghana ": "Reliable quantitative data on maize post-harvest losses and factors that cause them in northern Ghana are limited. In this study we assessed maize at six markets in the Northern Region of Ghana, in and around Tamale, during the harvest and storage period of October 2015\u2013June 2016. Across all the markets and sampling periods grain temperature was 32.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202f\u00b0C and equilibrium moisture content (EMC) was 9.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2%. EMC tended to decrease to a low in January and February and then increased again, while mean maize temperature was above 30\u202f\u00b0C in all months. The primary stored product insects collected from the samples were Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), Sitophilus spp., Rhyzopertha dominica (Fauvel), and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens). Using all the market and sampling month data, there was a significant correlation between EMC and total number of insects recovered, but not between total number of insects and temperature. The average percentage of insect-damaged kernels (IDK) in the maize sampled across all the markets and sampling periods was 2.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2%, with a range between 0 and 21.4%. Using all the market and sampling month data, levels of insect damage tended to be positively correlated with maize moisture, but not temperature, and levels of insect damage increased with number of stored product insects recovered. The action threshold for aflatoxin in maize in Ghana is 15\u202fppb, but overall mean aflatoxin level was 19.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.5\u202fppb and aflatoxin levels ranged from 0.3 to 132.2\u202fppb, with 53% of the samples having levels above 15\u202fppb. The mean fumonisin level was 1.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0\u202fppm, which is below the 4.0\u202fppm action threshold for Ghana. Our results show that aflatoxin levels were high in the market maize in Northern Region of Ghana and insects were prevalent, even though grain moisture tended to be relatively low, especially compared to the Middle Belt of Ghana."}{"Paddy rice stored under hermetic conditions: The effect of relative humidity, temperature and storage time in suppressing Sitophilus zeamais and impact on rice quality ": "The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of relative humidity in suppressing Sitophilus zeamais, in paddy rice stored under hermetic conditions, during four and seven months, at different average temperatures, as well as the impact on rice quality.\n                  Hermetic bags, GrainPro\u00ae SuperGrainbag\u00ae Farm\u2122, were used to store two rice varieties under three different relative humidities: 67%, 75% and 85% RH, and average temperatures of 14\u202f\u00b0C, 17\u202f\u00b0C and 24\u202f\u00b0C, both monitored by Hobo\u00ae Data loggers, with the probe placed inside the bags. CheckpointII Portable O2 and CO2 Gas Analyzer was used to assess gas contents on the top and bottom of each bag. At the end of the trials, paddy samples were collected to estimate water activity (aw). The rheology behaviour of rice pastes prepared with race flour obtained from the different treatments was also evaluated, using a controlled stress rheometer.\n                  The results showed that the response of the stored-product insects changes with environmental conditions, O2 and CO2 contents. Other parameters were considered; aw increased with relative humidity and temperature, but decreased with storage time. The relative humidity played an important role, together with the increase of temperature, in suppressing insect populations. A modified atmosphere was naturally produced inside the hermetic bag, under 85% RH, with low O2 and high CO2 contents, at different average temperatures, 14\u202f\u00b0C and 17\u202f\u00b0C. These results demonstrated that S.\u00a0zeamais can survive, but has no progeny. Under the same conditions, but at the higher average temperature of 24\u202f\u00b0C, S.\u00a0zeamais attained 100% mortality before producing progeny.\n                  The increase on respiration rate, registered by CO2 increase and O2 decrease, for higher RH values, reduced the viscoelastic functions and changed the starch gelatinization point of Indica and Japonica rice.\n                  The results obtained showed that storing paddy hermetically, at low relative humidity, did not change atmospheric content and maintained the viscoelastic functions of the rice pastes."}{"Performance of PICS bags under extreme conditions in the sahel zone of Niger ": "Experiments in Niger assessed whether extreme environmental conditions including sunlight exposure affect the performance of triple-layer PICS bags in protecting cowpea grain against bruchids. Sets of PICS bags and woven polypropylene bags as controls containing 50\u202fkg of naturally infested cowpea grain were held in the laboratory or outside with sun exposure for four and one-half months. PICS bags held either inside or outside exhibited no significant increase in insect damage and no loss in weight after 4.5 months of storage compared to the initial values. By contrast, woven bags stored inside or outside side by side with PICS bags showed several-fold increases in insects present in or on the grain and significant losses in grain weight. Grain stored inside in PICS bags showed no reduction in germination versus the initial value but there was a small but significant drop in germination of grain in PICS bags held outside (7.6%). Germination rates dropped substantially more in grain stored in woven bags inside (16.1%) and still more in woven bags stored outside (60%). PICS bags held inside and outside retained their ability to maintain internal reduced levels of oxygen and elevated levels of carbon dioxide. Exposure to extreme environmental conditions degraded the external polypropylene outer layer of the PICS triple-layer bag. Even so, the internal layers of polyethylene were more slowly degraded. The effects of exposure to sunlight, temperature and humidity variation within the sealed bags are described."}{"Primary radiation damage: A review of current understanding and models ": "Scientific understanding of any kind of radiation effects starts from the primary damage, i.e. the defects that are produced right after an initial atomic displacement event initiated by a high-energy particle. In this Review, we consider the extensive experimental and computer simulation studies that have been performed over the past several decades on what the nature of the primary damage is. We review both the production of crystallographic or topological defects in materials as well as radiation mixing, i.e. the process where atoms in perfect crystallographic positions exchange positions with other ones in non-defective positions. All classes of materials except biological materials are considered. We also consider the recent effort to provide alternatives to the current international standard for quantifying this energetic particle damage, the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens displacements per atom (NRT-dpa) model for metals. We present in detail new complementary displacement production estimators (\u201cathermal recombination corrected dpa\u201d, arc-dpa) and atomic mixing (\u201creplacements per atom\u201d, rpa) functions that extend the NRT-dpa, and discuss their advantages and limitations."}{"Fission gas release from UO2 nuclear fuel: A review ": "Gaseous fission product generation, transport, and release can have a large impact on nuclear fuel performance, degrading fuel and fuel\u2013cladding gap properties. Over the past several decades much progress has been made in understanding the key mechanisms of fission gas behavior through investigations with bulk reactor experiments and simplified analytical models. Concurrently, new mechanisms have come to light that can have a strong influence on gas release, especially the unexpected acceleration of fission gas release under high burn-up conditions. Additionally, novel modeling techniques, such as atomistic, mesoscale, and multiscale methods have joined the arsenal of investigative tools. In this review, existing research on the basic mechanisms of fission gas release during normal reactor operation is summarized, and critical areas where further work is needed are identified and discussed."}{"A review of fuel performance modelling ": ""}{"Radiation damage and irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking of additively manufactured 316L stainless steels ": "The irradiation-induced microstructure and irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC) behavior of additively manufactured (AM) 316L stainless steels produced by laser powder bed fusion were evaluated for the first time. Irradiation-induced dislocation loops, voids, and \u03b3\u2032 precipitates were observed in all processing conditions following 2.5 dpa at 360\u202f\u00b0C. The cell structure and dense dislocation walls in the stress-relieved AM materials recovered and showed signs of recrystallization following irradiation. Anisotropy in both tensile property and IASCC susceptibility were observed in the stress-relieved AM 316L stainless steel due to the printing texture. The hot-isotropic pressed AM 316L had better radiation tolerance and lower IASCC susceptibility than the stress-relieved AM 316L and conventionally forged 316L. Therefore, post-printing hot-isotropic pressing (HIP) is recommended for enhancing radiation tolerance and IASCC performance in nuclear applications as it eliminates the anisotropic mechanical behavior and IASCC susceptibility associated with the printing texture."}{"A brief review on breccia: it's contrasting origin and diagnostic signatures ": "A brief literature review on the breccias of contrasting origin, their diagnostic signatures along with related terminologies is presented here. The importance of individual breccia types and their geological implication has also been reviewed. The present study suggests that breccia is formed either by igneous, sedimentary and tectonic processes or a combination of these. This review is mainly focused on the most common seven sub-classes, (i.e., volcanic, igneous-hydrothermal, chert, collapse, fault, impact and seismic) and the specification of the processes involved in their formation, which subsequently brings more clarity in its classification and characterization."}{"Progress and challenges of big data research on petrology and geochemistry ": "We are entering the era of big data, and big data achievements have benefited ordinary people. However, big data application in geochemistry research has not been really appreciated. Big data is a kind of method and a pattern of thought. It is different from traditional scientific research methods and thinking in that it starts from the data and adopts full data mode. This paper introduces basalt, andesite and continental marginal arc basalt tectonic environment discrimination diagrams made by the author and his collaborators using all the global rock geochemical data available. We have discussed the following scientific problems of petrology and geochemistry using big data research: 1. we found many better illustrations in the study of discriminant diagrams, mainly relying on the relationship among the major elements, transition elements, and metal elements. What the points between the relationships are? Why did they work? These new questions need to be studied by the geochemists. 2. Data mining found that mid-ocean ridge is extremely lack of intermediate-acidic rocks. Does it mean that the upper mantle is an acute shortage of water? 3. This study found that the Miocene is the most developed epoch of magmatic activities. The Miocene appeared many important geological events in the world. Is there a connection between them? 4. The Miocene adakite most developed in the world, according to adakite exposed. There may be a giant Eurasian plateau from the Tibetan plateau to the Carpathians. 5. According to the spatial and temporal distribution of Cenozoic picrite, we put forward how to realize a global hotspot issues, etc. The paper also put forward some suggestions of further research and emphasized that science has entered the era of big data. In the era of big data, scientific classification standards have changed: any discipline which can be expressed in data is called science, and which cannot be expressed in data is called non-science. Whether it can be expressed by data is the watershed of science and non-science. In the era of big data, the geology encountered an unprecedented crisis. According to our forecast, in the foreseeable future, geophysics will be far ahead of geology. Space science will boom, and geochemistry will lead the way for a long time in the field of geology."}{"Zircon saturation in terrestrial basaltic melts and its geological implications ": "Zircon is a widely used accessary mineral, and zircon saturation in silicate melts has many applications in geology. Based on the original model proposed by Watson and Harrison (Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 64:295\u2013304, 1983), the quantification of the zircon saturation in melts with felsic and intermediate compositions has recently become a major research topic, resulting in some disagreements and different models. Theoretically, the addition of new data, especially regarding the zircon solubility in a basaltic (peralkaline) melt that can provide an upper limit below which zircon is likely to crystallize in igneous rocks, is thus critical to the development of a new, refined model that can be applied to a wide range of compositions and provide a resolution to the ongoing debate. Here, the zircon saturation in a terrestrial basaltic melt was systematically investigated for the first time using a piston-cylinder apparatus across the temperature range of 1050\u20131350\u00a0\u00b0C at pressures of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5\u00a0GPa. We combined our new data on mafic melts with data from previous studies on mafic to felsic melts to investigate the factors affecting zircon saturation in basaltic melts. Our results confirm an extremely high zircon saturation in mafic (peralkaline) melts in addition to its strong dependence on the melt composition and temperature and its weak dependence on the pressure and water content. We used all available data that can be used to calculate compositional parameter G [=(3\u00b7Al2O3\u00a0+\u00a0SiO2)/(Na2O\u00a0+\u00a0K2O\u00a0+\u00a0CaO\u00a0+\u00a0MgO\u00a0+\u00a0FeO), molar ratio] to evaluate fit to a previous model designed to work with more alkaline compositions and proposed a new refined model, given by (with 1\u03c3 errors): lnC\n                     Zr(melt)\u00a0=\u00a0(3.313\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.349)\u2013(1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10)\u00b7lnG\u00a0+\u00a0(0.0065\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0003)\u00b7T, where C\n                     Zr(melt) is the Zr concentration in the melt at zircon saturation and T is temperature in \u00b0C. Additionally, we reintroduced the previously proposed dominance of the temperature and melt composition on the degree of polymerization and thus the ability of zircon to enter the melt, thereby leading to large differences in the zircon saturation between intermediate-felsic magmas and mafic magmas. Although mantle-derived basaltic magmas have a low Zr concentration, they are capable of dissolving the zircon in surrounding rocks during their ascent. Zircons are generally rare in extrusive or hypabyssal basaltic rocks but can form during the late crystallization stage of plutonic basaltic magmas; thus, zircon crystallization has little impact on the distribution of trace elements in mafic magmas."}{"Fluid-controlled element transport and mineralization in subduction zones ": "Many of the world's metal deposits are associated with hydrothermal fluids in subduction zones, indicating the intimate relationship between subduction process and mineralization. During subduction process, subducting slab would release fluids/melts which in general could be subdivided into aqueous fluid, hydrous melt and supercritical fluid based on the water content and P-T condition. The distinct fluids/melts are able to transport plenty of elements to the overlying mantle wedge and play an important role in the formation of various deposits. Subduction-related mineralization includes porphyry-type deposit, orogenic gold (Au) deposit, metamorphic hydrothermal deposit, volcanogenic massive sulfides (VMS) deposit and so on. In particular, porphyry-type deposit is generally related to arc magmatism or partial melting of subducted plate, with parts of ore-forming fluids ultimately derived from dehydration of the subducted slab. The orogenic Au deposit and the metamorphic hydrothermal deposit are believed to result from metamorphic fluids with the former generally enriched in CO2. The other types of deposits in subduction zones are always related to magmatic rocks with the magma supplying materials, heat or driving force for ore-forming fluid circulation. The aqueous fluids derived from dehydration of subducting plate contain various amounts of CO2, Cl, S, N and other solutes. These components are efficient agents to dissolve and transport metals. When partial melting of subducted plate occurs, the melt could carry numerous metals and plays a direct role in mineralization. In addition, sulfide melts in subduction zones are extremely beneficial for the transport of chalcophile elements. Although numerous achievements have been obtained, some more detailed studies should be implemented to find out the exact processes of metal transport and redistribution. In this paper we firstly review ore deposits and fluid types in subduction zones, and then emphatically discuss subduction fluid-controlled element transport and its significance for widespread mineralization."}{"An evaluation of precision and accuracy of SIMS oxygen isotope analysis ": "In this study, a high-precision secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) zircon oxygen isotope ratio analytical protocol is described. The analysis is conducted using a Cameca IMS 1280-HR at the SIMS Laboratory of Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (GIGCAS). Four reference zircons (91,500, Qinghu, TEMORA 2 and Penglai) have been chosen to evaluate the reproducibility (precision) and accuracy. An identical protocol is used for the analyses, with unchanged instrumental parameters and with ion beam intensities kept as identical as possible. The Penglai zircon is used as an external reference material to calibrate the instrumental mass fractionation. The 91,500, Qinghu and TEMORA 2 zircons are used as the unknown samples, which yielded 10.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26\u2030 (2SD), 5.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u2030 (2SD) and 8.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u2030 (2SD), respectively, all consistent with the recommended values within error (2SD). A half-year long-term precision of 0.44\u2030 (2SD) is achieved using the Qinghu zircon as a monitoring sample for the routine measurement of zircon 18O/16O ratio, which demonstrates the reliability of this analytical protocol."}{"Measuring the decay constant of 87Rb: Is the decay in radioisotopes linear?\u00a0Manifestation and disintegration of the matter in space-time, and age\u00a0of the Universe ": "Villa et\u00a0al. (2015) (Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 164, 382\u2013385) proposed a new value of (1.3972\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0045) (10\u221211\u00a0yr\u22121) for the decay constant of 87Rb, which according to them is based on the meta-analysis of the analytical data of some experiments conducted by others. In my view their suggested value cannot be considered viable because it is very similar to the one which was discarded about forty years ago, and secondly, for restricting their meta-analysis to only four papers. Therefore, a need is felt to review the literature and take a fresh look at this problem. The paper also discusses some theoretical models for estimating the decay constant of 87Rb; and as per the theoretical model (Gargi, 2012; Chemie der Erde 72, 323\u2013332) the decay constant for 87Rb should be revised to 1.408 (10\u221211\u00a0yr\u22121). I have also shown that the mode of decay in unstable isotopes is in fact linear, not exponential. The linear decay and other phenomena, such as manifestation and disintegration of matter in space-time, and the origin and age of the Universe are all intertwined. Hence, the evidence for the one is also an evidence for the other. Therefore, the latter two phenomena also would be discussed briefly. The decay constant as measured in the laboratory assuming exponential decay increases with time."}{"Petrogenesis and mantle source characteristics of Triassic alkaline basaltic rocks of North Kamarbon, Northern Central Alborz, Iran ": "The Triassic alkaline basaltic rocks (TABR) of North Kamarbon are located in Central Alborz, which is regarded as the northern part of the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. Fractional crystallization does not appear as a major process in the genesis of TABR while different degree of partial melting may be regarded as the main process, based on petrography and geochemistry studies. The geochemical characteristics of TABR are in conflict with a substantial involvement of continental crust or crustal contamination. High (La/Yb)N and (Dy/Yb)N ratios, along with other geochemical features, in the TABR magma, suggest an asthenospheric origin, with low degree of partial melting of a garnet-bearing mantle sources. Enrichment patterns of LILE (Ba, Sr and Th), HFSE (Nb, Ta and Zr) and P, and depletion at HREE (Yb, Lu) are similar to what observed for OIB or intraplate alkaline magmatic rocks. The Sr and Nd isotopic ratios range from 0.70448 to 0.70522 and from 0.51269 to 0.51280, respectively, suggesting time-integrated slightly depleted magma sources. The data indicate that the evolution of TABR could be related to the rifting basin, in Late Triassic, which caused their development by upwelling and decompressional melting of an asthenospheric mantle, without a major involvement of subcontinental lithospheric mantle or crustal contamination."}{"Evaluation of terrigenous input, diagenetic alteration and depositional conditions of Lower Carboniferous carbonates of Tethys Himalaya, India ": "Geochemical and isotopic signatures from Lower Carboniferous Limestone of the Lipak Formation of Spiti region, Tethys Himalaya (for the first time) have been studied for palaeo-climatic reconstruction of the region and to evaluate the influence of terrigenous input into the Tethyan Ocean. The principal component analysis (PCA) suggests that CaO exhibits different modes of origin as compared to other elements. The low and relatively constant Al/Si ratio (0.19\u20130.46) of Lipak limestone suggests that Si has multiple sources besides clay minerals. Higher Al2O3 of the limestone than siliciclastic-contaminated carbonates (1.59%) as well as comparable Y/Ho ratio to terrestrial material suggests terrigenous input into the basin. The Er/Nd ratio ranges from 0.07 to 0.18 which further indicates the influence of detrital input (in normal seawater Er/Nd is 0.27). The Mn/Sr ratio suggests insignificant diagenetic alterations. The lack of correlation between Sr and LREE concentration in the limestone (r\u00a0=\u00a00.036) lends credence to this conclusion. Geochemical palaeo-redox parameters such as negative Mn and positive Ce anomalies\u00a0(V/V\u00a0+\u00a0Ni) and Th/U ratios indicate that the limestone was deposited in anoxic environmental conditions. \u03b418O and \u03b413C isotope composition of whole-rock samples ranges from \u221210%o to \u221224%o and +3.34%o to \u22128.24%o respectively indicating significant climatic change during Carboniferous period. These observations are consistent and match with those of contemporaneous carbonates elsewhere in the world, which can be linked to the alternative occurrences of cold and warm paleoclimates in the Carboniferous. The onset of the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation would have resulted in more positive \u03b413C and less negative \u03b418O values for these carbonates. The isotopic values also indicate eustatic sea level changes due to the glacial and interglacial phases during the period. Thus the signatures of Gondwana glaciation events are well preserved in the Lipak limestone of Spiti region."}{"Evaluating the effect of leaching on trace element and Nd-Pb isotopic systematics in continental basalts ": "Leaching technique was mostly carried out on submarine rock powder to minimize or eliminate secondary effect of seawater interaction on Sr and Pb isotope magmatic signatures. However, the effect of leaching on trace element contents is comparatively poorly established. To investigate such effects, we have compared trace element and Nd-Pb isotopic data for acid leached \u223c290\u00a0Ma Keping basalts in the Tarim Large Igneous Province (NW China) with unleached data on the same rocks. Rare earth elements (REE), Y, Th and U contents of leached sample grains (0.6\u20131.0\u00a0mm size) are 10\u201365% lower than those of unleached grains of the same sample, whereas other trace elements are not affected. Sm/Nd, Lu/Hf, U/Pb and Th/Pb ratios are fractionated by acid leaching between leached and unleached sample grains. Nd isotope values are unaffected by leaching, but 208Pb/204Pb and 206Pb/204Pb values of leached samples are significantly lower than those of unleached samples. X-ray diffraction results suggest that removal of secondary epidote during the acid leaching process could result in the fractionation of REE, Y, Th and U contents, and Sm/Nd, Lu/Hf, U/Pb and Th/Pb ratios, and 208Pb/204Pb and 206Pb/204Pb values. These results suggest that when the samples have been leached with strong acid (>1N HCl), their trace element cannot be used to trace the sources and petrogenesis. If leaching is applied to old (e.g., >100\u00a0Ma) continental basalts in order to eliminate contamination during sample collection, storage, sawing and crushing, Th/Pb and U/Pb ratios used to calculate the initial Pb isotope values, should be obtained on the same leached samples."}{"Principles underpinning the use of new methodologies in the risk assessment of cosmetic ingredients ": "Consumer safety is a prerequisite for any cosmetic product. Worldwide, there is an ever-increasing desire to bring safe products to market without animal testing, which requires a new approach to consumer safety. \u2018Next Generation Risk Assessment\u2019 (NGRA), defined as an exposure-led, hypothesis driven risk assessment approach that integrates in silico, in chemico and in vitro approaches, provides such an opportunity. The customized nature of each NGRA means that the development of a prescriptive list of tests to assure safety is not possible, or appropriate. The International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation (ICCR) therefore tasked a group of scientists from regulatory authorities and the Cosmetic Industry to agree on and outline the principles for incorporating these new approaches into risk assessments for cosmetic ingredients. This ICCR group determined the overall goals of NGRA (to be human-relevant, exposure-led, hypothesis-driven and designed to prevent harm); how an NGRA should be conducted (using a tiered and iterative approach, following an appropriate literature search and evaluation of the available data, and using robust and relevant methods and strategies); and how the assessment should be documented (transparent and explicit about the logic of the approach and sources of uncertainty). Those working on the risk assessment of cosmetics have a unique opportunity to lead progress in the application of novel approaches, and cosmetic risk assessors are encouraged to consider these key principles when conducting or evaluating such assessments."}{"Utilizing Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) with high throughput exposure predictions (HTE) as a risk-based prioritization approach for thousands of chemicals ": "Regulatory agencies across the world are facing the challenge of performing risk-based prioritization of thousands of chemicals in commerce. Here, we present an approach using the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) combined with heuristic high-throughput exposure (HTE) modelling to rank order chemicals for further evaluation. Accordingly, for risk-based prioritization, chemicals with exposures\u202f>\u202fTTC would be ranked as higher priority for further evaluation whereas substances with exposures\u202f<\u202fTTC would be ranked as lower priority. An initial proof of concept, using a dataset of 7986 substances with previously modeled median and upper 95% credible interval (UCI) total daily median exposure rates showed fewer than 5% of substances had UCI exposures\u202f>\u202fthe Cramer Class III TTC (1.5\u202f\u03bcg/kg-day). We extended the analysis by profiling the same dataset through the TTC workflow published by Kroes et al. (2004) which accounts for known exclusions to the TTC as well as structural alerts. UCI exposures were then compared to the appropriate class-specific TTC. None of the substances categorized as Cramer Class I or Cramer Class II exceeded their respective TTC values and no more than 2% of substances categorized as Cramer Class III or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors exceeded their respective TTC values. The modeled UCI exposures for the majority of the 1853 chemicals with genotoxicity structural alerts did exceed the TTC of 0.0025\u202f\u03bcg/kg-day, but only 79 substances exceeded this TTC if median exposure values were used. For substances for which UCI exposures exceeded relevant TTC values, we highlight possible approaches for consideration to refine the HTE: TTC approach. Overall, coupling TTC with HTE offers promise as a pragmatic first step in ranking substances as part of a risk-based prioritization approach."}{"Predictive models for acute oral systemic toxicity: A workshop to bridge the gap from research to regulation ": "In early 2018, the Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) published the \u201cStrategic Roadmap for Establishing New Approaches to Evaluate the Safety of Chemicals and Medical Products in the United States\u201d [1]. Cross-agency federal workgroups have been established to implement this roadmap for various toxicological testing endpoints, with an initial focus on acute toxicity testing. The ICCVAM acute toxicity workgroup (ATWG) helped organize a global collaboration to build predictive in silico models for acute oral systemic toxicity, based on a large dataset of rodent studies and targeted towards regulatory needs identified across federal agencies. Thirty-two international groups across government, industry, and academia participated in the project, culminating in a workshop in April 2018 held at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). At the workshop, computational modelers and regulatory decision makers met to discuss the feasibility of using predictive model outputs for regulatory use in lieu of acute oral systemic toxicity testing. The models were combined to yield consensus predictions which demonstrated excellent performance when compared to the animal data, and workshop outcomes and follow-up activities to make these tools available and put them into practice are discussed here."}{"Next generation physiologically based kinetic (NG-PBK) models in support of regulatory decision making ": "The fields of toxicology and chemical risk assessment seek to reduce, and eventually replace, the use of animals for the prediction of toxicity in humans. In this context, physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modelling based on in vitro and in silico kinetic data has the potential to a play significant role in reducing animal testing, by providing a methodology capable of incorporating in vitro human data to facilitate the development of in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of hazard information. In the present article, we discuss the challenges in: 1) applying PBK modelling to support regulatory decision making under the toxicology and risk-assessment paradigm shift towards animal replacement; 2) constructing PBK models without in vivo animal kinetic data, while relying solely on in vitro or in silico methods for model parameterization; and 3) assessing the validity and credibility of PBK models built largely using non-animal data. The strengths, uncertainties, and limitations of PBK models developed using in vitro or in silico data are discussed in an effort to establish a higher degree of confidence in the application of such models in a regulatory context. The article summarises the outcome of an expert workshop hosted by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) \u2013 European Union Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing (EURL ECVAM), on \u201cPhysiologically-Based Kinetic modelling in risk assessment \u2013 reaching a whole new level in regulatory decision-making\u201d held in Ispra, Italy, in November 2016, along with results from an international survey conducted in 2017 and recently reported activities occurring within the PBK modelling field. The discussions presented herein highlight the potential applications of next generation (NG)-PBK modelling, based on new data streams."}{"Assessing uncertainty in read-across: Questions to evaluate toxicity predictions based on knowledge gained from case studies ": "Read-across as an alternative assessment method for chemical toxicity has growing interest in both the regulatory and industrial communities. The pivotal means of acquiring acceptance of a read-across prediction is identifying and assessing uncertainties associated with it. This study has identified and summarised, in a structured way, the variety of uncertainties that potentially impact acceptance of a read-across argument. The main sources of uncertainty were established and divided into four main categories: i) the regulatory use of the prediction, ii) the data for the apical endpoint being assessed, iii) the read-across argumentation, and iv) the similarity justification. Specifically, the context of, and relevance to, the regulatory use of a read-across will dictate the acceptable level of uncertainties. The apical endpoint (or other) data must be of sufficient quality and relevance for data gap filling. Read-across argumentation uncertainties include: i) mechanistic plausibility (i.e., the knowledge of the chemical and biological mechanisms leading to toxicity), ii) completeness of the supporting evidence, iii) robustness of the supporting data, and iv) Weight-of-Evidence. In addition, similarity arguments for chemistry, physico-chemical properties, toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics are linked to these read-across argumentation issues. To further progress in this area, a series of questions are proposed with the goal of addressing each type of uncertainty."}{"Probabilistic prediction of human skin sensitiser potency for use in next generation risk assessment ": "Our aim is to develop and apply next generation approaches to skin allergy risk assessment that do not require new animal test data and better quantify uncertainties. We introduce the concept of the population threshold \u2013 a chemical-specific exposure level at which no individual in a population will experience induction of contact allergy to a chemical. A Bayesian multilevel (hierarchical) regression model is developed to estimate this population threshold under the conditions of a human-repeat-insult-patch-test. The approach is built on historical human (HRIPT) and murine (LLNA) data but, importantly, enables prediction based on in vitro (DPRA, Keratinosens\u2122, hCLAT and U-SENS\u2122) data. The Bayesian probabilistic framework allows us to explicitly quantify the uncertainty in the population threshold. Our skin allergy risk assessment defined approach (SARA DA) is used to estimate population thresholds for 30 chemicals using a weight-of-evidence across publicly available human, murine and in vitro data. Additionally, estimates for a further 43 chemicals are presented using chemical-specific data from in vitro assays only. Comparisons are made with current risk assessment metrics and across data types. We demonstrate that the approach can be used to derive a point-of-departure for next generation risk assessment based on in vitro data only."}{"Unlocking the potential of in silico chemical safety assessment \u2013 A report on a cross-sector symposium on current opportunities and future challenges ": "In silico chemical safety assessment can support the evaluation of hazard and risk following potential exposure to a substance. A symposium identified a number of opportunities and challenges to implement in silico methods, such as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and read-across, to assess the potential harm of a substance in a variety of exposure scenarios, e.g. pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and industrial chemicals. To initiate the process of in silico safety assessment, clear and unambiguous problem formulation is required to provide the context for these methods. These approaches must be built on data of defined quality, while acknowledging the possibility of novel data resources tapping into on-going progress with data sharing. Models need to be developed that cover appropriate toxicity and kinetic endpoints, and that are documented appropriately with defined uncertainties. The application and implementation of in silico models in chemical safety requires a flexible technological framework that enables the integration of multiple strands of data and evidence. The findings of the symposium allowed for the identification of priorities to progress in silico chemical safety assessment towards the animal-free assessment of chemicals."}{"Role of Physiologically Based Kinetic modelling in addressing environmental chemical mixtures \u2013 A review ": "The role of Physiologically Based Kinetic (PBK) modelling in assessing mixture toxicology has been growing for the last three decades. It has been widely used to investigate and address interactions in mixtures. This review describes the current state-of-the-art of PBK models for chemical mixtures and to evaluate the applications of PBK modelling for mixtures with emphasis on their role in chemical risk assessment. A total of 35 mixture PBK models were included after searching web resources (Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar), screening for duplicates, and excluding articles based on eligibility criteria. Binary mixtures and volatile organic compounds accounted for two-thirds of the chemical mixtures identified. The most common exposure route and modelled system were found to be inhalation and rats respectively. Twenty two (22) models were for binary mixtures, 5 for ternary mixtures, 3 for quaternary mixtures, and 5 for complex mixtures. Both bottom-up and top-down PBK modelling approaches are described. Whereas bottom-up approaches are based on a series of binary interactions, top-down approaches are based on the lumping of mixture components. Competitive inhibition is the most common type of interaction among the various types of mixtures, and usually becomes a concern at concentrations higher than environmental exposure levels. It leads to reduced biotransformation that either means a decrease in the amount of toxic metabolite formation or an increase in toxic parent chemical accumulation. The consequence is either lower or higher toxicity compared to that estimated for the mixture based on the additivity principle. Therefore, PBK modelling can play a central role in predicting interactions in chemical mixture risk assessment."}{"Grouping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes to read-across genotoxicity: A case study to evaluate the applicability of regulatory guidance ": "Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) consist of multiple layers of graphene sheets in a tubular shape. Depending on the synthesis and purification method, MWCNTs may differ in size, shape, rigidity and other properties. Previous research has shown that physicochemical properties can influence the translocation and toxicity of MWCNTs.\n                  Extensive in vitro and in vivo testing may be required to characterise the hazard of various physical forms of MWCNTs. Grouping of MWCNTs to read-across data for toxicological endpoints could efficiently contribute to reduce and focus MWCNT testing.\n                  This paper describes a case study to explore and illustrate read-across of genotoxicity data by following the \u201cRecommendations for nanomaterials applicable to the Guidance on QSARs and Grouping\u201d, developed by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The grouping hypothesis was supported by the use of chemoinformatics techniques such as hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis. The uncertainties of the present case study were evaluated using the Read-Across Assessment Framework (RAAF) developed by ECHA.\n                  While the aim of this study was not to conduct a hazard assessment, the study data chosen for illustrative purposes suggest that the MWCNTs analogues selected are not genotoxic. No (major) differences between the analogues were observed which could be attributed to differences in physicochemical properties such as length, diameter or rigidity/straightness. Such properties, however, may have an impact on other hazard endpoints such as carcinogenicity.\n                  This study shows the practical application of the ECHA framework for grouping of nanomaterials (NMs) as well as use of the ECHA RAAF for NMs, and how this can be supported by chemoinformatics techniques. Some adaptations to the workflow are suggested for a more practical and straightforward narrative in the reporting."}{"Physiologically based mathematical models of nanomaterials for regulatory toxicology: A review ": "The development of physiologically based (PB) models to support safety assessments in the field of nanotechnology has grown steadily during the last decade. This review reports on the availability of PB models for toxicokinetic (TK) and toxicodynamic (TD) processes, including in vitro and in vivo dosimetry models applied to manufactured nanomaterials (MNs). In addition to reporting on the state-of-the-art in the scientific literature concerning the availability of physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models, we evaluate their relevance for regulatory applications, mainly considering the EU REACH regulation. First, we performed a literature search to identify all available PBK models. Then, we systematically reported the content of the identified papers in a tailored template to build a consistent inventory, thereby supporting model comparison. We also described model availability for physiologically based dynamic (PBD) and in vitro and in vivo dosimetry models according to the same template. For completeness, a number of classical toxicokinetic (CTK) models were also included in the inventory. The review describes the PBK model landscape applied to MNs on the basis of the type of MNs covered by the models, their stated applicability domain, the type of (nano-specific) inputs required, and the type of outputs generated. We identify the main assumptions made during model development that may influence the uncertainty in the final assessment, and we assess the REACH relevance of the available models within each model category. Finally, we compare the state of PB model acceptance for chemicals and for MNs. In general, PB model acceptance is limited by the absence of standardised reporting formats, psychological factors such as the complexity of the models, and technical considerations such as lack of blood:tissue partitioning data for model calibration/validation."}{"The future of in silico chemical safety \u2026 and beyond ": "This commentary offers some perspectives on the future of in silico chemical safety assessment, grouped into four main themes: science, technology, regulation, and culture.

It reports\u202f>\u202f4.5 million data records for 15,145 organic chemicals that are ingredients in 32 different purpose groups of foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and 3682 colorants assigned to 36 chemical classes. Prioritization and scaling were facilitated by using: reference databases with known activities; data pre-processing; and prioritization P-metrics and P-indices to accentuate prediction strength of evidence and discriminate negative, indeterminate, and positive predictions. CD is computed based upon molecular descriptor properties of 1860 reference pharmaceuticals. CT is based upon predicted toxicities of 11,810 reference bioavailable test chemicals predicted with 3 software programs, 130 QSAR or expert system models. Results reveal major differences in toxicological activities: flavors and fragrances had very low predicted CD/CT activities, conversely, many colorants had high predicted genetic and carcinogenic activities. Contrasting CD/CT activities of flavors and hair dyes are presented. Furthermore, colorant chemical classes had different toxicological profiles, and a few classes having safer profiles were identified. Prediction data are also evaluated for DNA-reactivity as specified in ICH M7, persistent organic chemicals, and an alternative testing scheme is suggested to incorporate this methodology."}{"Computational models for the assessment of manufactured nanomaterials: Development of model reporting standards and mapping of the model landscape ": "Different types of computational models have been developed for predicting the biokinetics, environmental fate, exposure levels and toxicological effects of chemicals and manufactured nanomaterials (MNs). However, these models are not described in a consistent manner in the scientific literature, which is one of the barriers to their broader use and acceptance, especially for regulatory purposes. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) are in silico models based on the assumption that the activity of a substance is related to its chemical structure. These models can be used to provide information on (eco)toxicological effects in hazard assessment. In an environmental risk assessment, environmental exposure models can be used to estimate the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). In addition, physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models can be used in various ways to support a human health risk assessment. In this paper, we first propose model reporting templates for systematically and transparently describing models that could potentially be used to support regulatory risk assessments of MNs, for example under the REACH regulation. The model reporting templates include (a) the adaptation of the QSAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) to report models for MNs, and (b) the development of a model reporting template for PBK and environmental exposure models applicable to MNs. Second, we show the usefulness of these templates to report different models, resulting in an overview of the landscape of available computational models for MNs."}{"Homology models of mouse and rat estrogen receptor-\u03b1 ligand-binding domain created by in silico mutagenesis of a human template: Molecular docking with 17\u03b2-estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, and paraben analogs ": "Crystal structures exist for human, but not rodent, estrogen receptor-\u03b1 ligand-binding domain (ER\u03b1-LBD). Consequently, rodent studies involving binding of compounds to ER\u03b1-LBD are limited in their molecular-level interpretation and extrapolation to humans. Because the sequences of rodent and human ER\u03b1-LBDs are >95% identical, we expected their 3D structures and ligand binding to be highly similar. To test this hypothesis, we used the human ER\u03b1-LBD structure (PDB 3UUD) as a template to produce rat and mouse homology models. Employing the rodent models and human structure, we generated docking poses of 23 Group A ligands (17\u03b2-estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, and 21 paraben analogs) in AutoDock Vina for interspecies comparisons. Ligand RMSDs (\u00c5) (median, 95% CI) were 0.49 (0.21\u20131.82) (human-mouse) and 1.19 (0.22\u20131.82) (human-rat), well below the 2.0\u20132.5\u202f\u00c5 range for equivalent docking poses. Numbers of interspecies ligand-receptor residue contacts were highly similar, with Sorensen Sc (%)\u202f=\u202f96.8 (90.0\u2013100) (human-mouse) and 97.7 (89.5\u2013100) (human-rat). Likewise, numbers of interspecies ligand-receptor residue contacts were highly correlated: Pearson r\u202f=\u202f0.913 (human-mouse) and 0.925 (human-rat). Numbers of interspecies ligand-receptor atom contacts were even more tightly correlated: r\u202f=\u202f0.979 (human-mouse) and 0.986 (human-rat). Pyramid plots of numbers of ligand-receptor atom contacts by residue exhibited high interspecies symmetry and had Spearman r\n                     s\u202f=\u202f0.977 (human-mouse) and 0.966 (human-rat). Group B ligands included 15 ring-substituted parabens recently shown experimentally to exhibit decreased binding to human ER\u03b1 and to exert increased antimicrobial activity. Ligand efficiencies calculated from docking ligands into human ER\u03b1-LBD were well correlated with those derived from published experimental data (Pearson partial r\n                     p\u202f=\u202f0.894 and 0.918; Groups A and B, respectively). Overall, the results indicate that our constructed rodent ER\u03b1-LBDs interact with ligands in like manner to the human receptor, thus providing a high level of confidence in extrapolations of rodent to human ligand-receptor interactions."}{"The importance of mathematical modelling in chemical risk assessment and the associated quantification of uncertainty ": "Computational models pervade modern toxicology and are becoming an accepted part of chemical risk assessments. Mathematical and statistical tools are versatile enough to capture information from wide arrays of existing data and from our mechanistic understanding of human biology and chemical reactions. They are more accessible than ever given the number of readily available guidance documents and software packages. In the present article, we will highlight the utility of modelling for next generation risk assessments whilst emphasising the importance of characterising and reporting uncertainty. The concepts herein are the foundations for a paradigm shift in toxicology where transparency about scientific understanding replaces faith in animal models."}{"Titan's cold case files - Outstanding questions after Cassini-Huygens ": "The entry of the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft into orbit around Saturn in July 2004 marked the start of a golden era in the exploration of Titan, Saturn's giant moon. During the Prime Mission (2004\u20132008), ground-breaking discoveries were made by the Cassini orbiter including the equatorial dune fields (flyby T3, 2005), northern lakes and seas (T16, 2006), and the large positive and negative ions (T16 & T18, 2006), to name a few. In 2005 the Huygens probe descended through Titan's atmosphere, taking the first close-up pictures of the surface, including large networks of dendritic channels leading to a dried-up seabed, and also obtaining detailed profiles of temperature and gas composition during the atmospheric descent. The discoveries continued through the Equinox Mission (2008\u20132010) and Solstice Mission (2010\u20132017) totaling 127 targeted flybys of Titan in all. Now at the end of the mission, we are able to look back on the high-level scientific questions from the start of the mission, and assess the progress that has been made towards answering these. At the same time, new scientific questions regarding Titan have emerged from the discoveries that have been made. In this paper we review a cross-section of important scientific questions that remain partially or completely unanswered, ranging from Titan's deep interior to the exosphere. Our intention is to help formulate the science goals for the next generation of planetary missions to Titan, and to stimulate new experimental, observational and theoretical investigations in the interim."}{"Paradigm shifts about dust on the Moon: From Apollo 11 to Chang'e-4 ": "Strategic purposes of this DAP-2017 report are to update our DAP-2010 report on movements of inescapable fine lunar dust, to summarise key new measurements and to assist rigorous focus.\n                  Lunar dust is defined here in two sciences, Apollo dust and Ejecta dust, to end several confusions. The Kuhn Cycle is introduced to stimulate progression of a science about movements of Apollo dust which lacks an agreed paradigm to supply puzzles for scientists to solve and tools for their solution. We populate the cycle with two paradigm shifts. The first was serendipitous invention in 1966 of the Apollo Dust Detector Experiment (DDE), 3 orthogonal solar cells each with a thermometer, which on Apollo 12 measured cause and effect, collective movements of billions to trillions of low-energy Apollo dust particles and changes in temperature they cause. In contrast, Apollo 17 LEAM and LADEE LDEX experiments follow traditions to measure impacts of high-velocity Ejecta dust particles, one by one.\n                  In 2015, Apollo 12 DDE discoveries of sunrise-driven storms of Apollo dust stimulated a measurement-based 5-step model of dust transport at astronaut waist height. The discoveries solve (i) 50-year-old mysteries of Horizon Glow, (ii) 30-year-old uncertainties about levitated dust, (iii) processes leading to lunar surfaces being smooth and (iv) immobilisation of the Chang'e-3 lunar rover Yutu in 2014 after its first sunrise. The IAC-2017 Website   of a withdrawn Chang'e-3 presentation may support our views that sunrise-mobilised dust caused immobilisation of Yutu.\n                  A precursor to a second paradigm shift was May 2016 announced revision of Chang'e-4 scientific priorities. Using Kuhn terminology of scientific progress, a second shift would follow our \u201crevolution\u201d in 2015 that sunrise-driven dust storms caused the 2014 \u2033crisis\u201d of immobilisation of Chang'e-3 lunar rover Yutu. No such sequence occurred previously with lunar dust. Measurement-based evidence from Apollo 11 to Chang'e-3 confirms that Apollo dust is the major surface problem for risk management plans of lunar expeditions.\n                  As of 1 February 2018, a second paradigm change awaits transparent authoritative Ground truth measurements by Chang'e-4 or other relevant dust detectors to compare with Apollo 12 DDE measurements. Re-examination of risk management of effects of Apollo dust is essential for international expeditions including a Moon Village and Google Lunar XMedal competitors.\n                  Future DAPs could refine a third paradigm shift for Moon, moving from the past and present Earth-centric cultures of an inert Moon to cultures with visions of Moon as an active and close Extraterrestrial neighbour, because its outermost sunlit two cm of dusty plasmas are a variable soup of lunar and Extraterrestrial plasmas. An emphasis on its research seems a neat fit with the Directive of President Trump on 11 December 2017 to \u201cLead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial and international partners\u201d to \u201clead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization\u201d. It would also be measurement-based now thus less costly, more safe and quicker than any human visit to Mars."}{"Space weathering on the Moon: Farside-nearside solar wind precipitation asymmetry ": "The lunar surface is continuously under the impact of solar wind plasma, which breaks the chemical bonds of the surface material resulting in weathering of the surface and a modified chemical composition. Ion impact also sputters the surface material, affecting the composition of the lunar exosphere, and it controls the electrical properties of both the lunar surface and the near surface space.\n                  We have studied the lunar farside-nearside (FN) hemispherical asymmetry of the solar wind proton impact on the lunar surface along the orbit of the Moon during fast solar wind conditions. The analysis is based on a 3D hybrid model where ions are accelerated by the macroscopic j\u202f\u00d7\u202fB and pressure gradient forces.\n                  The derived proton impact surface map shows that the highest cumulative solar wind proton addition on the lunar surface is located on the farside while the most energetic protons precipitate on the nearside. The total ion impact rate was found to be smallest when the Moon is deep in the magnetotail. The total ion impact rate on the lunar surface varies while the Moon orbits the Earth and these longitudinal variations are caused by the magnetosphere and lunar tidal locking."}{"Mineralogy and spectroscopy (VIS near infrared and micro-Raman) of chromite from Nidar ophiolite complex, SE Ladakh, India: Implications for future planetary exploration ": "To determine the chemical composition of minerals on planetary surfaces from spectroscopic data, it is required to establish the link between mineralogy, spectroscopy and chemical composition of rock forming minerals on Earth. To meet this requirement, we performed integrated mineralogical and spectroscopic (Visible-Near Infrared and micro Raman) characterisation of chromite from the chromitite layer in the mantle section of the Nidar ophiolite complex, SE Ladakh, J&K, India. Chromite commonly occurs as monominerallic chromitite layers (up to 1 meter wide) and disseminated grains within the dunites and harzburgites. The Cr2O3 content is generally high (>60\u202fwt%) and chemically homogeneous across the grains. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses show highest peak intensity at \u223c36\u00b0 2\u03b8, followed by other diagnostic peaks for chromite. Micro-Raman of chromite yields very strong diagnostic Raman active vibrational modes at 685\u202fcm\u22121 (A1g), followed by 520\u202fcm\u22121 (F2g(2)). The other peaks, viz. 446\u202fcm\u22121 and 610\u202fcm\u22121 are rather weak and correspond to Eg and F2g, respectively. VNIR (0.4\u03bc to 2.4\u03bc) reflectance spectroscopy of chromite suggested strong absorption near 2\u202f\u03bcm and could be useful to quantify the chemical composition (especially Cr2O3, Al2O3 and Cr#). We found a good correlation of VNIR absorption and chemical composition of chromite (e.g. band positions versus Al2O3 and Cr# are well within 95% correlation interval). The intense Raman peak at 685\u202fcm\u22121 corresponds to higher Cr content. This study, therefore, implies a significant understanding in determination of mineral chemistry (especially Chromites) by VNIR and micro Raman spectroscopy, which could be a useful tool for the future planetary exploration."}{"The compositions of the lunar crust and upper mantle: Spectral analysis of the inner rings of lunar impact basins ": "The innermost ring in impact basins exposes material originating from various depths, and can be used to study the composition of the lunar crust with depth. In this study, we conduct quantitative mineralogical analyses of the innermost ring in 13 lunar impact basins using reflectance data from the Kaguya Multiband Imager and radiative transfer modeling. We use results from recent hydrocode modeling to calculate the depth of origin of the material exposed by the innermost rings. We find that the most abundant rock type on the innermost ring of most basins is anorthosite. The mafic assemblages are dominated by olivine in some cases, but most often by pyroxene. The impact modeling suggests that the innermost ring material was excavated from a wide range of depths. Here we focus on two mean depths: a crustal component and a mantle component. The crustal component largely dominates the innermost ring material, and the mantle component is present on the innermost ring of 9 of the basins we studied. On these 9 rings, the abundance of low-calcium pyroxene decreases with the proportion of crustal component, suggesting a dominantly mantle origin. However, as we do not detect exposures of ultramafic material, such mantle material is possibly present at the sub-pixel scale (<62\u202fm). This quantitative study reassesses the composition of the lunar crust and upper mantle, which is of great importance for understanding the formation of the Moon."}{"The physical properties of meteorites ": "Meteorites provide vast amounts of information on the make up and history of the solar system. Physical properties are a critical component to provide this information. This is a review of the physical properties of meteorites that have been conducted over the past approximately fifty years. Since the late 1950s, the understanding of physical properties has grown greatly. The density, porosity, and magnetic susceptibilities of hundreds of meteorites have been analyzed. More is known about the mineralogical and chemical compositions of meteorites, while the physical properties have not been as well characterized. Other properties summarized are specific gravity, strength (compressive and tensile), elastic wave velocity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity, albedo, and emissivity. For most stony meteorite types the average densities, between 3 and 4\u202fg/cm3, and porosities, below 10%, have not changed significantly over the 50 years. The compressive strengths of meteorites follow the expected trends of their material and cover a wide range from the weak Tagish Lake, 0.25\u202fMPa, to the strong Canyon Diablo, 411\u202fMPa. Thermal conductivity has mostly been studied from 200 to 300K, with most stony meteorites having conductivities less than 5\u202fW/(m-K). The studies of physical properties of meteorites provide information for a better understanding of meteor behavior in the atmosphere, model characteristics of parent bodies, and effectiveness of different deflection methods for potentially hazardous objects."}{"The 2016 UK Space Agency Mars Utah Rover Field Investigation (MURFI) ": "The 2016 Mars Utah Rover Field Investigation (MURFI) was a Mars rover field trial run by the UK Space Agency in association with the Canadian Space Agency's 2015/2016 Mars Sample Return Analogue Deployment mission. MURFI had over 50 participants from 15 different institutions around the UK and abroad. The objectives of MURFI were to develop experience and leadership within the UK in running future rover field trials; to prepare the UK planetary community for involvement in the European Space Agency/Roscosmos ExoMars 2020 rover mission; and to assess how ExoMars operations may differ from previous rover missions. Hence, the wider MURFI trial included a ten-day (or ten-\u2018sol\u2019) ExoMars rover-like simulation. This comprised an operations team and control centre in the UK, and a rover platform in Utah, equipped with instruments to emulate the ExoMars rovers remote sensing and analytical suite. The operations team operated in \u2018blind mode\u2019, where the only available data came from the rover instruments, and daily tactical planning was performed under strict time constraints to simulate real communications windows. The designated science goal of the MURFI ExoMars rover-like simulation was to locate in-situ bedrock, at a site suitable for sub-surface core-sampling, in order to detect signs of ancient life. Prior to \u201clanding\u201d, the only information available to the operations team was Mars-equivalent satellite remote sensing data, which were used for both geologic and hazard (e.g., slopes, loose soil) characterisation of the area. During each sol of the mission, the operations team sent driving instructions and imaging/analysis targeting commands, which were then enacted by the field team and rover-controllers in Utah. During the ten-sol mission, the rover drove over 100\u202fm and obtained hundreds of images and supporting observations, allowing the operations team to build up geologic hypotheses for the local area and select possible drilling locations. On sol 9, the team obtained a subsurface core sample that was then analyzed by the Raman spectrometer. Following the conclusion of the ExoMars-like component of MURFI, the operations and field team came together to evaluate the successes and failures of the mission, and discuss lessons learnt for ExoMars rover and future field trials. Key outcomes relevant to ExoMars rover included a key recognition of the importance of field trials for (i) understanding how to operate the ExoMars rover instruments as a suite, (ii) building an operations planning team that can work well together under strict time-limited pressure, (iii) developing new processes and workflows relevant to the ExoMars rover, (iv) understanding the limits and benefits of satellite mapping and (v) practicing efficient geological interpretation of outcrops and landscapes from rover-based data, by comparing the outcomes of the simulated mission with post-trial, in-situ field observations. In addition, MURFI was perceived by all who participated as a vital learning experience, especially for early and mid-career members of the team, and also demonstrated the UK capability of implementing a large rover field trial. The lessons learnt from MURFI are therefore relevant both to ExoMars rover, and to future rover field trials."}{"Verified solutions for the gravitational attraction to an oblate spheroid: Implications for planet mass and satellite orbits ": "Forces external to the oblate spheroid shape, observed from planetary to galactic scales, are demonstrably non-central, which has important ramifications for planetary science. We simplify historic formulae and derive new analytical solutions for the gravitational potential and force outside a constant density oblate. Numerical calculations that sum point mass contributions in a >109 element mesh confirm our equations. We show that contours of constant force and potential about oblate bodies are closely approximated by two confocal families whose foci (f) respectively are (9/10)\u00bd\n                     ae and (3/5)\u00bd\n                     ae for a body with f\u202f=\u202fae. This leads to useful approximations that address internal density variations. We demonstrate that the force on a general point is not directed towards the oblate's center, nor are forces simply proportional to the inverse square of that distance, despite forces in the equatorial and axial directions pointing towards the center. Our results explain complex dynamics of galactic systems. Because most planets and stars have an aspect ratio >0.9, the spherical approximation is reasonable except for orbits within \u223c2 body radii. We show that applying the \u201cgeneralized\u201d potential, which assumes central forces, yields J\n                     2 values half those expected for oblate bodies, and probably underestimates masses of Uranus and Neptune by \u223c0.2%. We show that the inner Saturnian moons are subject to non-central forces, which may affect calculations of their orbital precession. Our new series should improve interpretation of flyby data."}{"Gas flow in near surface comet like porous structures: Application to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko ": "We performed an investigation of a comet like porous surface to study how sub-surface sublimation with subsequent flow through the porous medium can lead to higher gas temperatures at the surface. A higher gas temperature of the emitted gas at the surface layer, compared to the sublimation temperature, will lead to higher gas speeds as the gas expands into the vacuum thus altering the flow properties on larger scales (kilometres away from the surface). Unlike previous models that have used modelled artificial structures, we used Earth rock samples with a porosity in the range 24\u201392% obtained from X-ray micro computed tomography (micro-CT) scans with resolution of some \u03bcm. Micro-CT scanning technology provides 3D images of the pore samples. The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the rarefied gas dynamics is directly applied on the digital rock samples in an unstructured mesh to determine the gas densities, temperatures and speeds within the porous medium and a few centimetres above the surface. The thicknesses of the rock samples were comparable to the diurnal thermal skin depth (5\u202fcm). H2O was assumed to be the outgassing species. We correlated the coma temperatures and other properties of the flow with the rock porosities. The results are discussed as an input to analysis of data from the Microwave Instrument on Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO) on the 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko."}{"Water in the history of Mars: An assessment ": "This paper presents a review of recent literature concerning issues related to the origin of water in planet Mars and its role in the geologic evolution of that planet. The baseline case of our discussion is the Grand Tack model of planetary migration in the solar nebula and an early planetary orbital instability according to the Nice Model. This discussion also benefits from a comparison with the Earth's accretional history. Recent observations are used to check the results of planetary accretion models, leading to a new picture of the early history of water on planet Mars. The embryo forming the basis of the planet is found to have been very deficient in water. During the following period, predating the formation of the Earth's Moon, the accreted water may have been as high as \u223c5\u202fkm Global Equivalent Layer (GEL) while the amount accreted at later times may have been as low as \u223c10\u202fm GEL according to recent studies. In particular, the trans-planetary source was insignificant, at whatever time it was active. The proposed resurfacing event creating the Borealis basin could have been important for the loss of a significant part of the early Martian water inventory."}{"Massive stereo-based DTM production for Mars on cloud computers ": "Digital Terrain Model (DTM) creation is essential to improving our understanding of the formation processes of the Martian surface. Although there have been previous demonstrations of open-source or commercial planetary 3D reconstruction software, planetary scientists are still struggling with creating good quality DTMs that meet their science needs, especially when there is a requirement to produce a large number of high quality DTMs using \u201cfree\u201d software. In this paper, we describe a new open source system to overcome many of these obstacles by demonstrating results in the context of issues found from experience with several planetary DTM pipelines. We introduce a new fully automated multi-resolution DTM processing chain for NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Context Camera (CTX) and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) stereo processing, called the Co-registration Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) Gotcha Optimised (CASP-GO), based on the open source NASA ASP. CASP-GO employs tie-point based multi-resolution image co-registration, and Gotcha sub-pixel refinement and densification. CASP-GO pipeline is used to produce planet-wide CTX and HiRISE DTMs that guarantee global geo-referencing compliance with respect to High Resolution Stereo Colour imaging (HRSC), and thence to the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA); providing refined stereo matching completeness and accuracy. All software and good quality products introduced in this paper are being made open-source to the planetary science community through collaboration with NASA Ames, United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System (AMMOS) Planetary Data System (PDS) Pipeline Service (APPS-PDS4), as well as browseable and visualisable through the iMars web based Geographic Information System (webGIS) system."}{"Synthesis, characterization, anticancer and antibacterial evaluation of Schiff base ligands derived from hydrazone and their transition metal complexes ": "Copper(II), Nickel(II) and Cobalt(III) complexes with Schiff base ligands derived from hydrazone, (HL1\n                     \u202f=\u202f(E)-N\u2032-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)benzohydrazide, H2L2\n                     \u202f=\u202f(E)-2-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazine-1-carboxamide and HL3\n                     \u202f=\u202f(E)-2-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)hydrazine-1-carboxamide, were synthesized and spectroscopically characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and cyclic voltammetry. The synthesized compounds have been screened for their antibacterial activities against the bacterial species E. coli, K. pneumonia (Gram-negative) and S. aureus, B. subtilis (Gram-positive) by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods. In vitro anticancer studies of the ligands and coordination compounds (1\u20133) using MTT assay was also done. Results show that the complexes (1\u20133) have higher antibacterial and anticancer activities than the respective free ligands."}{"Chiral 1,8-naphthyridine based ligands: Syntheses and characterization of Di- and tetranuclear copper (I) and silver (I) complexes ": "Oxazoline and camphor-pyrazole units are introduced on the 1,8-naphthyridine scaffold to access chiral ligands L1, L2 and L3. Metalation of these chiral ligands with Cu(I) and Ag(I) precursors afforded di- and tetranuclear complexes [Cu4I4(L1)2] (1), [Cu4I4(L2)2] (2), [Cu2I2(L3)] (3), [Cu2I(L2)2](OTf) (4), [Ag2(L1)2](OTf)2 (5) and [Ag4(L2)4Br](OTf)3 (6), containing [M4Xn] (n\u202f=\u202f1,4 and X\u202f=\u202fBr, I) or [M2Xn] (n\u202f=\u202f0, 1, 2 and X\u202f=\u202fI) core. All complexes are structurally characterized. Naphthyridine-derived ligands reveal bridge-chelate coordination motif and hold two metal centers in close proximity. The tetranuclear complexes are dimer of dinuclear complexes bridged by the halides. Electronic absorption and emission spectra of copper complexes are reported. Catalytic utility of all complexes are examined for asymmetric transformations but they showed poor activity probably due to limited solubility and coordinative saturation at the metal centers. The best results are obtained with [L3/Cu salt] combination for cyclopropanation of styrene, NH bond insertion and nitroaldol (Henry) reactions with very low enantioselectivity."}{"Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks nanosheets: Synthesis strategies and applications ": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as an attractive class of porous crystalline polymers in recent decade years, which are built from metal nodes and organic linkers with highly regular spatial structures, tunable pores and enormous surface areas. Compared with common bulky MOFs, two-dimension MOFs nanosheets (2D MNS) exhibit outstanding properties like ultrathin thickness and more accessible active sits are considered as a compelling two-dimension material now. Here various methods to obtain MNS including \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cbottom-up\u201d will be introduced and their applications in separation, catalysis and sensors will also be discussed in this review."}{"Synthesis and characterization of nano-sized metal organic framework-5 (MOF-5) by using consecutive combination of ultrasound and microwave irradiation methods ": "Nano-sized metal organic framework-5 (MOF-5) was prepared in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) via consecutive combination of ultrasound (US) and microwave irradiation (MW) methods by exploiting the benefit of obtaining MOF-5 in very short reaction times (\u223c2\u202fmin) and high yields (\u223c95%). The surface area of MOF-5 was found to be 1203\u202fm2/g. The highly crystalline structure of nano-sized MOF-5 was confirmed by XRD. Vibrational modes and thermal decomposition behavior of nano-sized MOF-5 were verified from ATR FT-IR and TGA results, respectively. Based on SEM and AFM results, MOF-5 nanoparticles are spherical in shape, and their sizes vary in the range of 20\u201380\u202fnm. The high purity of nanosized MOF-5 was confirmed by XRD and EDS results. A very regular and homogenous distribution of MOF-5 nanoparticles with a size range of 20\u201330\u202fnm within poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolyte was clearly observed from SEM results. The reason behind size reduction and homogenous distribution of nano-sized MOF-5 was stated as the elimination of any possible aggregation of MOF-5 nanoparticles due to favorable physical interactions between PEO and surface functional groups of MOF-5 during the solution casting process."}{"Water-based preparation of nano-sized NH2-MIL-53(Al) frameworks for enhanced dye removal ": "Nano-sized NH2-MIL-53(Al) particles were conveniently synthesized in aqueous solution at ambient temperature with a widely applicable mixing method, and the morphology and character were examined with a series of techniques. XRD patterns and TEM images showed that the obtained NH2-MIL-53(Al) material possessed rod-like shape, which is different from those obtained from N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). This nano-sized NH2-MIL-53(Al) matrix displayed enhanced efficiency for adsorptive elimination of methyl blue molecules in aqueous solution."}{"Microplastics in wastewater treatment plants: Detection, occurrence and removal ": "Microplastics have aroused increasing concern as they pose threats to aquatic species as well as human beings. They do not only contribute to accumulation of plastics in the environment, but due to absorption they can also contribute to spreading of micropollutants in the environment. Studies indicated that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in releasing microplastics to the environment. Therefore, effective detection of the microplastics and understanding their occurrence and fate in WWTPs are of great importance towards microplastics control. In this review, the up-to-date status on the detection, occurrence and removal of microplastics in WWTPs are comprehensively reviewed. Specifically, the different techniques used for collecting microplastics from both wastewater and sewage sludge, and their pretreatment and characterization methods are reviewed and analyzed. The key aspects regarding microplastics occurrence in WWTPs, such as concentrations, total discharges, materials, shapes and sizes are summarized and compared. Microplastics removal in different treatment stages and their retention in sewage sludge are explored. The development of potential microplastics-targeted treatment technologies is also presented. Although previous researches in microplastics have undoubtedly improved our level of understanding, it is clear that much remains to be learned about microplastics in WWTPs, as many unanswered questions and thereby concerns still remain; some of these important future research areas are outlined. The key challenges appear to be to harmonize detection methods as well as microplastics mitigation from wastewater and sewage sludge."}{"A review of bio-based materials for oil spill treatment ": "Being cost-effective, synthetic materials were initially used abundantly for the removal of oil. Gradually, however, awareness of the use of dispersants like Corexit, which makes water resources more toxic than oil, has changed the scenario for the treatment of spilled oil. The removal of spilled oil from water resources is still a very topical issue. An eco-friendly and sustainable approach towards the environment has introduced many low-cost, non-toxic and biodegradable materials along with different biomasses to make micro-to nano-sized materials, membranes, sponges/aerogel, etc. for the removal and recovery of oil from water resources. Additionally, the reusability of these materials after the recovery of oils has added one more step towards sustainability. This review comprises the work conducted by various researchers in the field of the removal and recovery of spilled oils using various biomasses and polymers, either in the form of sorbents or separators."}{"Occurrence, identification and removal of microplastic particles and fibers in conventional activated sludge process and advanced MBR technology ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are acting as routes of microplastics (MPs) to the environment, hence the urgent need to examine MPs in wastewaters and different types of sludge through sampling campaigns covering extended periods of time. In this study, the efficiency of a municipal WWTP to remove MPs from wastewater was studied by collecting wastewater and sludge samples once in every two weeks during a 3-month sampling campaign. The WWTP was operated based on the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The microplastic particles and fibers from both water and sludge samples were identified by using an optical microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscope and Raman microscope. Overall, the retention capacity of microplastics in the studied WWTP was found to be 98.3%. Most of the MP fraction was removed before the activated sludge process. The efficiency of an advanced membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology was also examined. The main related finding is that MBR permeate contained 0.4\u202fMP/L in comparison with the final effluent of the CAS process (1.0\u202fMP/L). According to this study, both microplastic fibers and particles are discharged from the WWTP to the aquatic environment."}{"Evaluation of advanced oxidation processes for water and wastewater treatment \u2013 A critical review ": "This study provides an overview of established processes as well as recent progress in emerging technologies for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In addition to a discussion of major reaction mechanisms and formation of by-products, data on energy efficiency were collected in an extensive analysis of studies reported in the peer-reviewed literature enabling a critical comparison of various established and emerging AOPs based on electrical energy per order (EEO) values. Despite strong variations within reviewed EEO values, significant differences could be observed between three groups of AOPs: (1) O3 (often considered as AOP-like process), O3/H2O2, O3/UV, UV/H2O2, UV/persulfate, UV/chlorine, and electron beam represent median EEO values of <1\u202fkWh/m3, while median energy consumption by (2) photo-Fenton, plasma, and electrolytic AOPs were significantly higher (EEO values in the range of 1\u2013100 kWh/m3). (3) UV-based photocatalysis, ultrasound, and microwave-based AOPs are characterized by median values of >100\u202fkWh/m3 and were therefore considered as not (yet) energy efficient AOPs. Specific evaluation of 147 data points for the UV/H2O2 process revealed strong effects of operational conditions on reported EEO values. Besides water type and quality, a major influence was observed for process capacity (lab-vs. pilot-vs. full-scale applications) and, in case of UV-based processes, of the lamp type. However, due to the contribution of other factors, correlation of EEO values with specific water quality parameters such as UV absorbance and dissolved organic carbon were not substantial. Also, correlations between EEO and compound reactivity with OH-radicals were not significant (photolytically active compounds were not considered). Based on these findings, recommendations regarding the use of the EEO concept, including the upscaling of laboratory results, were derived."}{"FDM process parameters influence over the mechanical properties of polymer specimens: A review ": "Designing and manufacturing functional parts for fields such as engineering and medicine is a major goal of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). These activities should be supported by knowledge on how different settings of process parameters impact the mechanical behavior of the products. However, obtaining this information is a quite complex task given the large variety of possible combinations of materials-3D printers-slicing software-process parameters. Thus, the importance of reviewing the current research on this topic for identifying practical and useful aspects, key process parameters and limitations, but also for understanding to what extent the results of these researches are relevant and can be applied in further studies and real applications. A systematic literature search was performed based on classification according to the type of 3D printing polymer. The most significant process parameters considered as influencing FDM specimens' tensile, compression, flexural or impact strengths are discussed considering the results presented in the literature. A necessary distinction between the mechanical properties of material and testing specimens (as given by producers and by experiments) and the mechanical behavior of a FDM end-part is also made."}{"Melt strength and drawability of HDPE, LDPE and HDPE/LDPE blends ": "The melt strength and drawability of a low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and HDPE/LDPE blends during extension flow were studied using a Rheotens test method under die extrusion temperature ranging from 160 to 200\u202f\u00b0C and die extrusion rates varying from 9 to 36\u202fmm/s. The results showed that the melt strength of the HDPE, the LDPE and the blends decreased with increasing die extrusion temperature while it increased with increasing die extrusion rate. The drawability of the HDPE, the LDPE and the blend melts could be improved through increasing die extrusion temperature and reducing die extrusion ratio. The dependence of the melt strength of the HDPE, the LDPE and the blend melts on the die extrusion temperature approximately obeyed the Arrhenius equation."}{"Interlaminar bonding performance of 3D printed continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites using fused deposition modelling ": "Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming more significant in industrial applications due to their inherit advantages such as excellent mechanical performance, potential use in lightweight structures and being recyclable. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative to conventional processes for the fabrication of CFRTPCs due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. However, a major concern affecting the efficient use of 3D printed composites is their weak interlaminar bonding performance compared to conventional pre-preg composites. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of layer thickness and fibre volume content on the interlaminar bonding performance of 3D printed continuous carbon, glass and Kevlar\u00ae fibre reinforced nylon composites manufactured by FDM technique. Short beam shear tests were carried out to determine interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). SEM images and cross-sectional micrographs were examined to assess failure mechanics of the different configurations.\n                  It was observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the interlaminar shear performance was marginally significance. ILSS values decrease as layer thickness increase due to higher porosity. In addition, continuous fibre reinforced samples show higher ILSS values than unreinforced ones but, conversely, the level of increase in ILSS is moderate with continued increase in fibre content, particularly in the case of Kevlar\u00ae fibre. Carbon fibre reinforced composites exhibit the best interlaminar shear performance with higher stiffness. On the other hand, Kevlar\u00ae fibre reinforced composites have the lowest interlaminar shear performance due to poor wettability of Kevlar\u00ae fibre bundles by the nylon, leading to extensive delamination. Finally, the results obtained demonstrate that it is still a challenge to increase shear performance of 3D printed composites with respect to common pre-preg materials. Nevertheless, ILSS values exhibited by 3D printed composites are significantly higher than the usual 3D printed thermoplastics."}{"Medical grade polylactide, copolyesters and polydioxanone: Rheological properties and melt stability ": "Rheological measurements have shown that lactide-based copolymers with L-lactide content between 50 and 100 \u202fmol% with varying comonomers, as well as polydioxanone (PDX), can be used in additive manufacturing analogously to poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) if their melt behaviour are balanced. The results indicate that copolymers can be melt processed if the temperature is adjusted according to the melting point, and parameters such as the speed are tuned to conteract the elastic response.\n                  Small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) rheology, thermal and chemical characterisation allowed us to map the combined effect of temperature and frequency on the behaviour of six degradable polymers and their melt stability. Values of complex viscosity and Tan\u202f\u03b4 obtained through nine time sweeps by varying temperature and frequency showed that the molecular structure and the number of methylene units influenced the results, copolymers of L-lactide with D-Lactide (PDLLA) or glycolide (PLGA) had an increased elastic response, while copolymers with trimethylene carbonate (PLATMC) or \u03b5-caprolactone (PCLA) had a more viscous behaviour than PLLA, with respect to their relative melting points. PDLLA and PLGA require an increased temperature or lower speed when processed, while PLATMC and PCLA can be used at a lower temperature and/or higher speed than PLLA. PDX showed an increased viscosity compared to PLLA but a similar melt behaviour. Negligible chain degradation were observed, apart from PLGA."}{"Biodegradability studies of poly(butylene succinate) composites filled with sugarcane rind fiber ": "Biodegradable composites were prepared from poly(butylene succinate)(PBS) and sugarcane rind fiber (SRF) by melt blending. The effects of SRF content and burial time on the biodegradability of SRF/PBS composites were investigated. Soil burial experiment was lasted 100 days under natural soil conditions. The biodegradability of pure PBS and SRF/PBS composites was evaluated by analyzing weight loss, mechanical properties, morphological properties, melting and crystallization behavior and thermal stability after the soil burial test. The weight loss and the mechanical property loss ratio of SRF/PBS composites were higher than that of pure PBS, and reached a maximum value when the SRF content was 5\u202fwt% after soil burial for 100 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) suggested that the degree of erosion of the composites was higher than that of the pure PBS. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG) showed an increase in crystallization temperature(Tc), degree of crystallinity(\u03c7c) and maximum weight loss rate temperature(Tmax) after soil burial for 100 days except for the 5\u202fwt% SRF/PBS composites. It is indicated that 5\u202fwt% SRF addition had the maximum impact on the accelerated degradation of PBS."}{"Self-healing chitosan/vanillin hydrogels based on Schiff-base bond/hydrogen bond hybrid linkages ": "Natural vanillin, the primary component of vanilla bean extract, was used as crosslinking agent to fabricate self-healing chitosan hydrogel. The aldehyde group of vanillin reacts with the amino group of one chitosan molecule through a Schiff-base reaction while its hydroxyl group forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl or the amino groups in another chitosan molecule, which provides the basis for construction of a reversible network. We found that the self-healing effect of the chitosan/vanillin hydrogel mainly originated from the reconstruction of the Schiff-base bond, while the hydrogen bonds were relatively stable at room temperature. It was found that 10\u202fml 5% (w/v) chitosan solution gelated with 0.3\u202fg vanillin achieved a good balance between self-healing capability and mechanical strength, reaching a moderate gelation time of 6\u202fmin. When the vanillin dosage exceeded 0.3\u202fg, a compact network was formed. In this case, the chitosan molecule chains were unable to move freely due to the fact that the linkages were fixed by the massive hydrogen bonds, which reduced the formation of new hybrid linkages through the dynamic exchange of Schiff-base bonds. This made the chitosan/vanillin hydrogel lose its self-healing capability."}{"On the miscibility of PVDF/PMMA polymer blends: Thermodynamics, experimental and numerical investigations ": "In this paper the miscibility of PVDF/PMMA blends was studied using different approaches: experimental tests, thermodynamics and numerical simulation. The first part of this study is devoted to the experimental work and aims to investigate the miscibility of blends by different experimental techniques. First, blends of PVDF/PMMA at different ratios were compounded and characterized using physico-chemical and rheological methods. The effect of PMMA content on the crystallization behavior of PVDF in the blend was experimentally investigated. At a second stage, the thermodynamic interaction parameter of Flory-Huggins was evaluated as a function of the PMMA proportion in the blends based on the experimental data related to the PVDF melting point and enthalpy. Besides, a numerical method has been developed using Fluent Ansys software to describe the coalescence phenomenon under different scenarios of viscosity ratios and grain sizes of polymers. The confrontation of the code simulation results with the experimental and thermodynamic approaches has shown a good agreement for reproducing the behavior of miscible polymers as well as their aptitude to form a homogeneous blend."}{"Polymer-based sensors: A review ": "Polymers are indispensable component of modern sensor devices.

Despite various challenges associated with lignin valorization, several strategies have emerged that could deliver value-added products in good yields. The present contribution aims to critically review recent advancements in biological, thermochemical and electrochemical strategies for lignin depolymerization mainly focusing on enzymatic, acid/base/metal-catalyzed, and microwave-assisted degradation approaches. All lignin degradation strategies result in the production of an arsenal of several monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric compounds, with no single molecule being produced in significant amount. For large-scale production of biofuels and other value-added chemicals via lignin depolymerization, the combination of two or more technologies with low cost and recyclable catalysts operating at mild reaction conditions needs to be explored."}{"Catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass over zeolites for high quality bio-oil \u2013 A review ": "Catalytic fast pyrolysis is a prominent technology for yielding high quality bio-oil and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass while the application of catalyst has been a hotspot for being capable to deoxygenate bio-oil and enhance its fuel properties. The fundamental reaction pathways in catalytic fast pyrolysis and potential routes of bio-oil and chemicals production from three major individual components are discussed at the early section of the review. The effect and potentiality of solid acid catalyst mainly zeolites, biomass particle size and catalyst loading ratio on the yield and quality of bio-oil are then emphasized. In addition, the lumped kinetic model and distributed activation energy model (DAEM), used to predict the thermal behavior of biomass components and energy calculation in catalytic pyrolysis are described.

As a unique chemical reaction, pyrolysis of microalgae yields useful chemicals like light olefins, alkanes, syngas, and biochar, as well as the bio-oils with less oxygen, more hydrocarbons, and higher gross heating values than the bio-oils derived from cellulosic biomass. The article reviews direct pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae, pyrolytic products, reaction mechanisms, and upgrading of microalgal bio-oils. Based on critical analyses of the state-of-the-art developments in this field, the article provides the following perspectives. The current major bottleneck of microalgal technologies is still the productivity, which makes microalgae less abundant than cellulosic biomass at this stage. Biorefinery of microalgae shall be further developed to produce multiple products from various microalgal species. Determination of high value-added chemicals that can be produced from microalgae, especially from microalgal proteins, might significantly promote the development of the conversion technologies and related catalytic science. Designing novel catalysts for the selective conversion of microalgae into fine chemicals may increase the effective use of microalgae and the economics of the process. With the advancement of science and technology, catalytic pyrolysis technology has the potential to process microalgae into biofuels and fine chemicals."}{"Municipal solid waste (MSW) pyrolysis for bio-fuel production: A review of effects of MSW components and catalysts ": "With the realization of fossil fuels depletion, research has been started on the alternate energy sources. Biomass is a renewable energy source, from which bio-fuels can been produced. These bio-fuels are then used for power generation. Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a type of biomass which has been widely used in the production of bio-fuels. Since 1900s, studies have shown that a lot of research has been done in determining the optimum processes for producing bio-fuel through MSW. Pyrolysis is one of these processes. This process roots out various drawbacks which are present in other processes. It produces high grade pyrolysis fuel and reduces production cost. This review paper focuses on pyrolysis of MSW by using its components as a feedstock material with varying composition. The effects of interaction between different components of MSW and their heating values has been reviewed. The heating values are then compared with conventional fuels to highlight the significance of MSW pyrolysis products. The case of catalytic pyrolysis has also been reviewed and the corresponding heating values are compared to obtain high quality fuel.

Among which, the remarkable non \u2013 wetting properties of lotus leaf has hugely occupied the minds of students, researchers and industrialists from last two decades. Due to high contact angle (>150\u00b0), water drops readily roll off the lotus leaf surface compiling dirt particles. This self \u2013 cleaning lotus effect has found huge attention in daily life. Many surfaces in day-to-day life eventually get contaminated due to the accumulation of dust/dirt or through air pollution. A huge amount of money, labor and energy is wasted in their restoration. The self \u2013 cleaning superhydrophobic coating is one of the best options for this problem. In this study, the suspension of hydrophobic silica nanoparticles was dip and/or spray coated on the body of motorcycle, building wall, mini boat, solar cell panel, window glass, cotton shirt, fabric shoes, paper (currency notes), metal, wood, sponges, plastic and marble. Every coated substrate exhibited superhydrophobicity with water contact angle nearly 160\u00b0 and sliding angle less than 6\u00b0.

A more sustainable pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) should be implemented to match future operations and management of the pharmaceutical products across the entire life cycle. The main purpose of this study is to identify the potential sustainability barriers of PSC and to investigate how Industry 4.0 can be applied in the sustainable PSC paradigms. This paper systematically reviews 33 relevant articles concerning sustainable PSC and Industry 4.0, taken from peer-reviewed academic journals over a decade (2008\u20132018). Based on content analysis, we find that the major challenges that inhibit inclusion of sustainability in the PSCs are: high costs and time consumption, little expertise and training, enforcement of regulations, the paucity of business incentives, ineffective collaborations and coordination across the PSC, lack of objective benchmarks, and poor end-customer awareness. The technologies and innovations based on Industry 4.0 can solve these barriers with regards to four aspects: enhancing the flexibility of the PSC for patient-centric drug supplies; improving the effectiveness of coordination and communication across different entities within the PSC; mitigating waste and pollution at different stages; and enabling a more autonomous decision-making process for supply chain managers. Our analysis reveals that future research interest should focus on: cross-linking coordination and cooperation, eco-friendly end-of-life products disposal, proactive product recall management, new benchmarks and measurement of sustainable performance, new regulation system design, and effects of incentives for sustainable activities."}{"Biopotential of compost and compost products derived from horticultural waste\u2014Effect on plant growth and plant pathogens' suppression ": "Besides ecological and environmental benefits of green open spaces, horticultural waste management has various environmental consequences. Green waste composting represents promising environmentally friendly alternative which gives valuable products with positive soil and plants impact. Composting products\u2019 quality determinates their application and depends on the particular waste material and process parameters. The aim of this paper was to estimate the chemical and microbiological quality of green waste compost and compost products (compost tea, compost extract and the solid phase after extraction), and their biopotential based on germination rate, germination index and inhibition of phytopathogenic fungi growth. Higher germination rate of examined plant seeds was noticed on the solid phase after extraction, and compost extract, compared to compost, and compost tea, respectively. Plants with low germination rate grown on compost showed higher fresh and dry biomass. Compost products strongly inhibited the growth of plant pathogens Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia sp., and Pythium debaryanum. Presented results show that composted biodegradable waste from urban green spaces contribute to the plant growth and phytopathogenic fungi suppression, and thus improve the overall environmental quality."}{"Industry 4.0 implementation for multinationals ": "Delivering on digitalization for large multinational business, in the contemporary context of global operations and real time delivery, is a significant opportunity. Operations of localised facilities independent of global operations can result in compromised global synergies.

These so-called Sustainable Development Goals are intended to serve as a foundation for a transformation of the global economies towards a sustainable development. This transformation process should be built on an economic development in accordance with social equality and within ecological boundaries. As essential stakeholders for a global sustainable development, industrial organizations have to shift towards a novel paradigm which puts an emphasis on sustainable value creation. Industrial value creation has gone through radical changes during the last years. Since the 2010s, the so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) can be observed. The state of the art in research and technology for Industry 4.0 and sustainability is outlined. The potential for sustainable value creation in Industry 4.0 is qualitatively assessed for a macro and micro perspective based on a literature review and expert interviews. The assessment unfolds that the value creation might positively contribute to a sustainable development in many cases. Critical areas with expected negative contributions related to the quantity of materials used, primary energy consumption, and working conditions are identified and elaborated in more detail. A demonstrator for an intelligent cube production is investigated in order to verify the results of the assessment. This demonstrator is currently set up in China as part of a Sino-German Research Institute."}{"The teratogenicity of allopurinol: A comprehensive review of animal and human studies ": "Allopurinol is widely used in the management of multiple disorders including gout, kidney stones and inflammatory bowel disease. Despite of long-term experience, its safety in pregnancy has been debated due to reports on possible teratogenicity. We aimed to review the literature on the safety of allopurinol in pregnancy and offspring. In animals, allopurinol induced species-specific reproductive toxicity. In humans, a total of 53 allopurinol exposed infants were reported in the literature. Major congenital malformations were reported in two cases with a comparable pattern of multiple abnormalities. Five other infants had minor birth defects. In conclusion, the association between allopurinol and teratogenicity appears to be weak and limited to two reports with uncertain causality. However, the available data are insufficient to make a certain judgement, and as allopurinol treatment evolves, report and prospective follow-up of all exposed infants (i.e. deviant and normal cases) should be encouraged."}{"First trimester ondansetron exposure and risk of structural birth defects ": "This study investigates risk of specific structural birth defects associated with ondansetron exposure during the first trimester in a large US commercially-insured population.\n                  Medical claims data were obtained from Truven Health Analytics for 864,083 mother-infant pairs from 2000 to 2014. Logistic regression was used to measure the association between first trimester exposure to ondansetron and risk of cardiac defects, orofacial clefts and other specific structural defects in offspring.\n                  First trimester exposure to ondansetron was associated with increased risk of cardiac (OR: 1.52 95% CI: 1.35\u20131.70) and orofacial cleft defects (OR: 1.32 95% CI: 0.76\u20132.28) in offspring compared to women with no antiemetic exposure during pregnancy.\n                  This analysis addresses limitations of prior studies including limited power, exposure misclassification, and generalizability to the US population. In a large, US population we found a statistically significant association between early pregnancy ondansetron exposure and specific structural birth defects in offspring."}{"Folic acid and primary prevention of neural tube defects: A review ": "With 4\u202fmg folic acid daily, it may take 20 weeks to reach red-blood-cell folate levels between 1050 and 1340 nmol/L, optimal for reduction of the neural tube defect risk. Therefore, folic acid supplementation should be started 5\u20136 months before conception. The residual risk with optimal red-blood-cell folate levels is reportedly 4.5 per 10,000 total births. The residual risk in pooled data from countries with mandatory folic acid fortification is 7.5 per 10,000 pregnancies, regardless of pre-fortification rates. European monitoring of folate intake with questionnaires should be replaced by periodic measurements of red-blood-cell folate. The risk of folate intake >1\u202fmg/day does not outweigh the benefits of folic acid fortification, provided un-metabolized folic acid, RBC folate and vitamin B12 are monitored periodically. A European monitoring system, based on U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, should reside with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."}{"Effects of bisphenol A and its analogs on reproductive health: A mini review ": "Known endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to be a reproductive toxicant in animal models. Its structural analogs: bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol AF (BPAF), and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) are increasingly being used in consumer products. However, these analogs may exert similar adverse effects on the reproductive system, and their toxicological data are still limited. This mini-review examined studies on both BPA and BPA analog exposure and reproductive toxicity. It outlines the current state of knowledge on human exposure, toxicokinetics, endocrine activities, and reproductive toxicities of BPA and its analogs. BPA analogs showed similar endocrine potencies when compared to BPA, and emerging data suggest they may pose threats as reproductive hazards in animal models. While evidence based on epidemiological studies is still weak, we have utilized current studies to highlight knowledge gaps and research needs for future risk assessments."}{"The Debye-H\u00fcckel theory and its importance in modeling electrolyte solutions ": "A colleague at the Technical University of Denmark has often stated: \u201cLife is too short for electrolytes\u201d. Another well-known scientist in the field of molecular simulation has recently said during an international Thermodynamics conference: \u201cAll my life I have tried to keep myself away from water and electrolytes\u201d. Sadly, what these statements correctly imply is that there are far too many unclear questions and concepts in electrolyte thermodynamics, and associated difficulties in modeling electrolyte solutions. In this work, we attempt to shed some light on some important concepts and misconceptions in electrolyte thermodynamics associated with the development of electrolyte equations of state, with emphasis on those based on the Debye-H\u00fcckel theory. Detailed mathematics is needed for some of the derivations but for brevity and in order to emphasize the principles rather than the derivations, the latter are omitted. We first discuss the peculiarities of electrolyte thermodynamics and associated modeling and continue with a literature review of equations of state for electrolyte solutions. Next we will provide a modern derivation of the Debye-H\u00fcckel and Born equations and discuss their assumptions in detail to answer some of the confusion that exists in current literature on the applicability ranges and show how the different versions of the Debye-H\u00fcckel and Born models are related. A discussion and outlook section conclude this review. Several of the statements in this work challenge \u201caccepted beliefs\u201d in electrolyte thermodynamics and, while we believe that this challenge is justified, we hope that a useful debate can result in improved and predictive thermodynamic models for electrolyte solutions."}{"Pelagic key species and mechanisms driving energy flows in the northern Benguela upwelling ecosystem and their feedback into biogeochemical cycles ": "The northern Benguela Upwelling System (nBUS) has been facing increasing temperatures and decreasing dissolved oxygen (DO) levels over the last decades. This has implications for key processes and trophic interactions within the ecosystem including shifts in community composition, distribution ranges, and trophic levels, changes in energy flows and migration patterns with feedbacks to biogeochemical processes. Here we summarise the results gained from the GENUS project (Geochemistry and Ecology of the Namibian Upwelling System) focussing on the geochemical and ecological structures and processes dominating the pelagic component of the nBUS. Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of key species of zooplankton and fish larvae yielded biomass estimates (5 to 81\u202fg\u202fWet Mass\u202fm\u22122 (10 to 90% quantile) with a median of 19.5\u202fg\u202fWet Mass\u202fm\u22122 for the upper 200\u202fm) and potential impacts on the vertical carbon flux. Vertical distribution ranges of key taxa were determined reflecting their specific abilities to tolerate hypoxia and, hence, their different adaptive mechanisms to cope with the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). The shoaling of the 2.5\u202fmL\u202fO2\u202fL\u22121-oxycline (0.24\u202fm\u202fy\u22121) constrains sensitive species and hampers daily and seasonal vertical migrations. It may also affect the ability of organisms to maintain themselves within nearshore habitats by hindering vertical migration into deeper onshore currents. Respiration rates of key species were determined with one standard method (optode respirometry), showing an average respiration rate of 54.6\u202fmL\u202fO2\u202fd\u22121 (g Dry Mass)\u22121 for the bulk fraction of mesozooplankton, allowing also the estimate of DO consumption by mesozooplankton at different depth layers. Stable isotopic ratios (N, C) revealed trophic interactions and positions of zooplankton and fish. Our results reveal many players within a small range of trophic levels and a dominance of zooplankton taxa (copepods, euphausiids) in terms of biomass over small pelagic fish (sardine, anchovy), essential to consider for future higher-resolution ecosystem modelling."}{"Modelling dispersal of juvenile krill released from the Antarctic ice edge: Ecosystem implications of ocean movement ": "Sea ice retreat is a key event affecting Southern Ocean ecosystems during spring and summer. The impacts of this change can be seen in these ecosystems from primary producers to top predators, through biological, chemical and physical systems. We apply a Lagrangian particle tracking method to investigate transport processes from the retreating sea ice edge in the Southern Ocean during spring and summer. The resulting distribution of surface krill patches is used as a case study for our modelling approach. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a secondary producer, plays a key role in the Southern Ocean ecosystems. Antarctic krill are highly abundant in the Southern Ocean with a complex distribution pattern both in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Observations dating back to the 1930s show that juvenile krill often form surface patches \u2013 high density clusters of krill at the ocean surface \u2013 throughout the Southern Ocean during the spring and summer seasons.\n                  We develop a hypothesis, based on historical observations, that surface krill patches composed of juvenile krill move passively with ocean currents after their release from the sea ice edge zone in spring. Applying this hypothesis and method to the Southern Hemisphere spring/summer, leads to results that indicate that the observed changes in distribution of krill patches from historical to contemporary records could be related to the southward shift of the sea ice edge over the last century."}{"Hydrodynamics of river plume intrusion into an adjacent estuary: The Minho River and Ria de Vigo ": "Minho River intrusion into the Rias Baixas has a twofold impact on estuaries. On the one hand, freshwater intrusion can modify the water exchange with the shelf affecting the residence time. On the other hand, it can fertilize the area and promote phytoplankton blooms and increase estuarine primary production. For these reasons, it is crucial to understand the frequency, duration, and relaxation of river freshwater intrusions. The frequency of intrusion events into the rias was calculated by means of in situ data from 2006 to 2016 using the difference in salinity between the inner part of the estuary and the southern mouth (\u0394S) as a proxy. Minho River intrusions, which are characterized by \u0394S\u202f>\u202f0, were detected in 8.9% of the available measurements in the Ria de Vigo, in 8.4% in the Ria de Pontevedra, and in only 4.5% in the Ria de Arousa. The FLOW module of the Delft3D model, which was previously calibrated and validated for the study area, was used to analyze the hydrodynamics of the intrusion events. The Ria de Vigo, which is the closest one to the Minho Estuary, was chosen to analyze the duration and intensity of the freshwater intrusions. Several consecutive events were detected in early 2010 (January 11th to February 8th) with \u0394S values ranging from 0.7 to 2.0. Velocity and density profiles were analyzed in the middle part of the estuary, where seven freshwater intrusions matched the wind peaks favorable to intrusion events with an approximate delay of ~12\u202fh. In general, the duration of the events was on the order of 1.5\u202fdays, although in one particular case the event lasted >3\u202fdays. The dynamic behavior of the freshwater intrusions was represented using velocity and density profiles along the main axis of Ria de Vigo. Finally, the phases of an intrusion event were characterized: initial positive estuarine circulation pattern; development of the intrusion; well-developed negative estuarine circulation; relaxation of the intrusion and recovery of the initial positive circulation."}{"Machine learning applications in minerals processing: A review ": "Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques have an ever-increasing presence and impact on a wide-variety of research and commercial fields. Disappointed by previous hype cycles, researchers and industrial practitioners may be wary of overpromising and underdelivering techniques. This review aims at equipping researchers and industrial practitioners with structured knowledge on the state of machine learning applications in mineral processing: the supplementary material provides a searchable summary of all techniques reviewed, with fields including nature of case study data (synthetic/laboratory/industrial), level of success, area of application (e.g. milling, flotation, etc), and major problem category (data-based modelling, fault detection and diagnosis, and machine vision). Future directions are proposed, including suggestions on data collection, technique comparison, industrial participation, cost-benefit analyses and the future of mineral engineering training."}{"The beneficiation of lithium minerals from hard rock ores: A review ": "The demand for lithium minerals has increased considerably in recent years due to the application of lithium compounds in lithium ion battery technology, portable electronic gadgets and power storage systems. Spodumene is the main lithium bearing mineral which is currently being explored and processed due to its high lithium content and the extensive occurrence of deposits. This literature review focuses on the various techniques used in the beneficiation of lithium minerals from hard rock pegmatite ores. Dense media separation and flotation are the main beneficiation methods used for the separation of lithium minerals from ores. The close similarity in chemical and physical properties between lithium minerals and associated gangue minerals complicates the beneficiation of lithium minerals from ores. Surface chemistry of minerals, type of collector, pulp pH, chemical pre-treatment methods, and the presence of slimes play key roles in lithium minerals flotation. This review also deals with the beneficiation flowsheets employed at some of the larger lithium processing plants in the world. Spodumene from pegmatite deposits is expected to be the main source of lithium from ores at present although future sources would most probably include other minerals such as lepidolite, petalite, zinnwaldite, jadarite and hectorite."}{"Study of Venturi tube geometry on the hydrodynamic cavitation for the generation of microbubbles ": "Venturi tubes have been extensively used to generate microbubbles through hydrodynamic cavitation. Due to their simple and flexible design, Venturi tubes have been used in a wide range of applications including mineral flotation. Although the impacts of the geometries of Venturi tubes on hydrodynamic cavitation have been studied in different specific contexts, no clear relation between cavitation and geometry parameters of Venturi tubes has been reported. In this work, we investigated numerically and experimentally the influence of several geometrical parameters on the cavitation inception detected by a hydrophone and the microbubble generation measured by a high-speed camera. Using a dimensionless number analysis, we found that the cavitation inception was determined by flow resistance, which significantly depends on the geometrical design of Venturi tube. In the cavitation regime, the flow resistance induced by cavitation increases linearly with reducing downstream cavitation number while the upstream cavitation number becomes constant regardless of the geometry of Venturi tube. A small outlet angle results in a low cavitation inception and a high microbubble production. Moreover, the degree of microbubble generation was found to increase with extra flow resistance and the dissolved gas concentration. The insights from this study provide a guideline for the design of efficient Venturi tubes for hydrodynamic cavitation system."}{"Science and Engineering of Superhydrophobic Surfaces: Review of Corrosion Resistance, Chemical and Mechanical Stability ": "Investigations on superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) are very interesting because of their importance in many applications. One of the major applications of these SHS is to increase the corrosion resistance of surfaces exposed to corrosive environments as well as their long-term chemical stability and maintaining the superhydrophobic characteristics. Deep understanding of how to increase the corrosion resistance by SHS has a significant effect on the development of strategies to improve corrosion resistance and long-term chemical stability of these surfaces. Other important properties that limited the real use of superhydrophobic surfaces are mechanical stability. In this review article, an overview of SHS is provided, and then their fabrication methods discussed. Moreover, the corrosion resistance of these SHS fabricated by various methods and their chemical stability and mechanical stability are reviewed. -In the following, recent strategies for improvement of corrosion resistance, chemical and mechanical stability are reviewed."}{"Coral reef degradation affects the potential for reef recovery after disturbance ": "The loss of coral cover is often accompanied by an increase of benthic algae, a decline in biodiversity and habitat complexity. However, it remains unclear how surrounding communities influence the trajectories of re-colonization between pulse disturbance events. Over a 12-month field experiment in the central Red Sea, we examined how healthy (hard-coral dominated) and degraded (algae-dominated) reef areas influence recruitment and succession patterns of benthic reef foundation communities on bare substrates. Crustose coralline algae and other calcifiers were important colonizers in the healthy reef area, promoting the accumulation of inorganic carbon. Contrary, substrates in the degraded area were predominantly colonized by turf algae, lowering the accumulation of inorganic carbon by 178%. While coral larvae settlement similarly occurred in both habitats, degraded areas showed 50% fewer recruits. Our findings suggest that in degraded reefs the replenishment of adult coral populations is reduced due to recruitment inhibition through limited habitat complexity and grazing pressure, thereby restraining reef recovery."}{"Oyster disease in a changing environment: Decrypting the link between pathogen, microbiome and environment ": "Shifting environmental conditions are known to be important triggers of oyster diseases. The mechanism(s) behind these synergistic effects (interplay between host, environment and pathogen/s) are often not clear, although there is evidence that shifts in environmental conditions can affect oyster immunity, and pathogen growth and virulence. However, the impact of shifting environmental parameters on the oyster microbiome and how this affects oyster health and susceptibility to infectious pathogens remains understudied. In this review, we summarise the major diseases afflicting oysters with a focus on the role of environmental factors that can catalyse or amplify disease outbreaks. We also consider the potential role of the oyster microbiome in buffering or augmenting oyster disease outbreaks and suggest that a deeper understanding of the oyster microbiome, its links to the environment and its effect on oyster health and disease susceptibility, is required to develop new frameworks for the prevention and management of oyster diseases."}{"Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environments: Evidence of emerged threat and future challenges for marine organisms ": "Pharmaceuticals are nowadays recognized as a threat for aquatic ecosystems. The growing consumption of these compounds and the enhancement of human health in the past two decades have been paralleled by the continuous input of such biologically active molecules in natural environments. Waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as a major route for release of pharmaceuticals in aquatic bodies where concentrations ranging from ng/L to \u03bcg/L are ubiquitously detected. Since medicines principles are designed to be effective at very low concentrations, they have the potential to interfere with biochemical and physiological processes of aquatic species over their entire life cycle. Investigations on occurrence, bioaccumulation and effects in non target organisms are fragmentary, particularly for marine ecosystems, and related to only a limited number over the 4000 substances classified as pharmaceuticals: hence, there is a urgent need to prioritize the environmental sustainability of the most relevant compounds. The aim of this review is to summarize the main adverse effects documented for marine species exposed in both field and laboratory conditions to different classes of pharmaceuticals including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, psychiatric, cardiovascular, hypocholesterolaemic drugs, steroid hormones and antibiotics. Despite a great scientific advancement has been achieved, our knowledge is still limited on pharmaceuticals behavior in chemical mixtures, as well as their interactions with other environmental stressors. Complex ecotoxicological effects are increasingly documented and multidisciplinary, integrated approaches will be helpful to clarify the environmental hazard of these \u201cemerged\u201d pollutants in marine environment."}{"Changes in the biochemical and nutrient composition of seafood due to ocean acidification and warming ": "Ocean acidification and warming may threaten future seafood production, safety and quality by negatively impacting the fitness of marine species. Identifying changes in nutritional quality, as well as species most at risk, is crucial if societies are to secure food production. Here, changes in the biochemical composition and nutritional properties of the commercially valuable oysters, Magallana gigas and Ostrea edulis, were evaluated following a 12-week exposure to six ocean acidification and warming scenarios that were designed to reflect the temperature (+3\u00a0\u00b0C above ambient) and atmospheric pCO2 conditions (increase of 350\u2013600\u202fppm) predicted for the mid-to end-of-century. Results suggest that O. edulis, and especially M. gigas, are likely to become less nutritious (i.e. containing lower levels of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate), and have reduced caloric content under ocean acidification and warming. Important changes to essential mineral composition under ocean acidification and warming were evident in both species; enhanced accumulation of copper in M. gigas may be of concern regarding consumption safety. In light of these findings, the aquaculture industry may wish to consider a shift in focus toward species that are most robust to climate change and less prone to deterioration in quality, in order to secure future food provision and socio-economic benefits of aquaculture."}{"Indoor air humidity, air quality, and health \u2013 An overview ": "There is a long-standing dispute about indoor air humidity and perceived indoor air quality (IAQ) and associated health effects. Complaints about sensory irritation in eyes and upper airways are generally among top-two symptoms together with the perception \u201cdry air\u201d in office environments. This calls for an integrated analysis of indoor air humidity and eye and airway health effects. This overview has reviewed the literature about the effects of extended exposure to low humidity on perceived IAQ, sensory irritation symptoms in eyes and airways, work performance, sleep quality, virus survival, and voice disruption. Elevation of the indoor air humidity may positively impact perceived IAQ, eye symptomatology, and possibly work performance in the office environment; however, mice inhalation studies do not show exacerbation of sensory irritation in the airways by low humidity. Elevated humidified indoor air appears to reduce nasal symptoms in patients suffering from obstructive apnea syndrome, while no clear improvement on voice production has been identified, except for those with vocal fatigue. Both low and high RH, and perhaps even better absolute humidity (water vapor), favors transmission and survival of influenza virus in many studies, but the relationship between temperature, humidity, and the virus and aerosol dynamics is complex, which in the end depends on the individual virus type and its physical/chemical properties. Dry and humid air perception continues to be reported in offices and in residential areas, despite the IAQ parameter \u201cdry air\u201d (or \u201cwet/humid air\u201d) is semantically misleading, because a sensory organ for humidity is non-existing in humans. This IAQ parameter appears to reflect different perceptions among other odor, dustiness, and possibly exacerbated by desiccation effect of low air humidity.\n                  It is salient to distinguish between indoor air humidity (relative or absolute) near the breathing and ocular zone and phenomena caused by moisture-damage of the building construction and emissions therefrom. Further, residential versus public environments should be considered as separate entities with different characteristics and demands of humidity. Research is needed about particle, bacteria and virus dynamics indoors for improvement of quality of life and with more focus on the impact of absolute humidity. \u201cDry (or wet) air\u201d should be redefined to become a meaningful IAQ descriptor."}{"A Faecal Contamination Index for interpreting heterogeneous diarrhoea impacts of water, sanitation and hygiene interventions and overall, regional and country estimates of community sanitation coverage with a focus on low- and middle-income countries ": "Objectives\n                  The impact on diarrhoea of sanitation interventions has been heterogeneous. We hypothesize that this is due to the level of prevailing faecal environmental contamination and propose a Faecal Contamination Index (FAECI) of selected WASH indicators (objective 1). Additionally, we provide estimates of the proportion of the population living in communities above certain sanitation coverage levels (objective 2).\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  \n                     Objective 1: Faecal contamination post-intervention was estimated from WASH intervention reports. WASH indicators composing the FAECI included eight water, sanitation and hygiene practice indicators, which were selected for their relevance for health and data availability at study- and country-level. The association between the estimated level of faecal environmental contamination and diarrhoea was examined using meta-regression. Objective 2: A literature search was conducted to identify health-relevant community sanitation coverage thresholds. To estimate total community coverage with basic sanitation in low- and middle-income countries, at relevant thresholds, household surveys with data available at primary sampling unit (PSU)-level were analysed according to the identified thresholds, at country-, regional- and overall level.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  \n                     Objective 1: We found a non-linear association between estimated environmental faecal contamination and sanitation interventions\u2019 impact on diarrhoeal disease. Diarrhoea reductions were highest at lower faecal contamination levels, and no diarrhoea reduction was found when contamination increased above a certain level. Objective 2: Around 45% of the population lives in communities with more than 75% of coverage with basic sanitation and 24% of the population lives in communities above 95% coverage, respectively.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  High prevailing faecal contamination might explain interventions' poor effectiveness in reducing diarrhoea. The here proposed Faecal Contamination Index is a first attempt to estimate the level of faecal contamination in communities. Much of the world's population currently lives in faecally contaminated environments as indicated by low community sanitation coverage."}{"Towards 5G communication systems: Are there health implications? ": "The spread of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) is rising and health effects are still under investigation. RF-EMF promote oxidative stress, a condition involved in cancer onset, in several acute and chronic diseases and in vascular homeostasis. Although some evidences are still controversial, the WHO IARC classified RF-EMF as \u201cpossible carcinogenic to humans\u201d, and more recent studies suggested reproductive, metabolic and neurologic effects of RF-EMF, which are also able to alter bacterial antibiotic resistance. In this evolving scenario, although the biological effects of 5G communication systems are very scarcely investigated, an international action plan for the development of 5G networks has started, with a forthcoming increment in devices and density of small cells, and with the future use of millimeter waves (MMW). Preliminary observations showed that MMW increase skin temperature, alter gene expression, promote cellular proliferation and synthesis of proteins linked with oxidative stress, inflammatory and metabolic processes, could generate ocular damages, affect neuro-muscular dynamics. Further studies are needed to better and independently explore the health effects of RF-EMF in general and of MMW in particular. However, available findings seem sufficient to demonstrate the existence of biomedical effects, to invoke the precautionary principle, to define exposed subjects as potentially vulnerable and to revise existing limits. An adequate knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms linking RF-EMF exposure to health risk should also be useful in the current clinical practice, in particular in consideration of evidences pointing to extrinsic factors as heavy contributors to cancer risk and to the progressive epidemiological growth of noncommunicable diseases."}{"Burden of climate change on malaria mortality ": "In 2016, an estimated 445,000 deaths and 216 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide, while 70% of the deaths occurred in children under five years old. Changes in climatic exposures such as temperature and precipitation make malaria one of the most climate sensitive outcomes. Using a global malaria mortality dataset for 105 countries between 1980 and 2010, we find a non-linear relationship between temperature and malaria mortality and estimate that the global optimal temperature threshold beyond which all-age malaria mortality increases is 20.8\u202f\u00b0C, while in the case of child mortality; a significantly lower optimum temperature of 19.3\u00b0 is estimated. Our results also suggest that this optimal temperature is 28.4\u202f\u00b0C and 26.3\u202f\u00b0C in Africa and Asia, respectively \u2013 the continents where malaria is most prevalent. Furthermore, we estimate that child mortality (ages 0\u20134) is likely to increase by up to 20% in some areas due to climate change by the end of the 21st century."}{"Environmental conditions in health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries: Coverage and inequalities ": "Safe environmental conditions and the availability of standard precaution items are important to prevent and treat infection in health care facilities (HCFs) and to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets for health and water, sanitation, and hygiene. Baseline coverage estimates for HCFs have yet to be formed for the SDGs; and there is little evidence describing inequalities in coverage. To address this, we produced the first coverage estimates of environmental conditions and standard precaution items in HCFs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); and explored factors associated with low coverage. Data from monitoring reports and peer-reviewed literature were systematically compiled; and information on conditions, service levels, and inequalities tabulated. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with low coverage. Data for 21 indicators of environmental conditions and standard precaution items were compiled from 78 LMICs which were representative of 129,557 HCFs. 50% of HCFs lack piped water, 33% lack improved sanitation, 39% lack handwashing soap, 39% lack adequate infectious waste disposal, 73% lack sterilization equipment, and 59% lack reliable energy services. Using nationally representative data from six countries, 2% of HCFs provide all four of water, sanitation, hygiene, and waste management services. Statistically significant inequalities in coverage exist between HCFs by: urban-rural setting, managing authority, facility type, and sub-national administrative unit. We identified important, previously undocumented inequalities and environmental health challenges faced by HCFs in LMICs. The information and analyses provide evidence for those engaged in improving HCF conditions to develop evidence-based policies and efficient programs, enhance service delivery systems, and make better use of available resources."}{"Pathogens transmitted in animal feces in low- and middle-income countries ": "Animals found in close proximity to humans in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) harbor many pathogens capable of infecting humans, transmissible via their feces. Contact with animal feces poses a currently unquantified\u2014though likely substantial\u2014risk to human health. In LMIC settings, human exposure to animal feces may explain some of the limited success of recent water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions that have focused on limiting exposure to human excreta, with less attention to containing animal feces.\n                  We conducted a review to identify pathogens that may substantially contribute to the global burden of disease in humans through their spread in animal feces in the domestic environment in LMICs. Of the 65 potentially pathogenic organisms considered, 15 were deemed relevant, based on burden of disease and potential for zoonotic transmission. Of these, five were considered of highest concern based on a substantial burden of disease for which transmission in animal feces is potentially important: Campylobacter, non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), Lassa virus, Cryptosporidium, and Toxoplasma gondii. Most of these have a wide range of animal hosts, except Lassa virus, which is spread through the feces of rats indigenous to sub-Saharan Africa. Combined, these five pathogens cause close to one million deaths annually. More than half of these deaths are attributed to invasive NTS. We do not estimate an overall burden of disease from improperly managed animal feces in LMICs, because it is unknown what proportion of illnesses caused by these pathogens can be attributed to contact with animal feces.\n                  Typical water quantity, water quality, and handwashing interventions promoted in public health and development address transmission routes for both human and animal feces; however, sanitation interventions typically focus on containing human waste, often neglecting the residual burden of disease from pathogens transmitted via animal feces. This review compiles evidence on which pathogens may contribute to the burden of disease through transmission in animal feces; these data will help prioritize intervention types and regions that could most benefit from interventions aimed at reducing human contact with animal feces."}{"The effectiveness of respiratory protection worn by communities to protect from volcanic ash inhalation. Part I: Filtration efficiency tests ": "During volcanic eruptions and their aftermath, communities may be concerned about the impacts of inhaling volcanic ash. Access to effective respiratory protection (RP) is therefore important for many people in volcanic areas all over the world. However, evidence to support the use of effective RP during such crises is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to build the first evidence base on the effectiveness of common materials used to protect communities from ash inhalation in volcanic crises.\n                  We obtained 17 forms of RP, covering various types of cloth through to disposable masks (typically used in occupational settings), which communities are known to wear during volcanic crises. The RP materials were characterised and subjected to filtration efficiency (FE) tests, which were performed with three challenge dusts: ashes from Sakurajima (Japan) and Soufri\u00e8re Hills (Montserrat) volcanoes and aluminium oxide (Aloxite), chosen as a low-toxicity surrogate dust of similar particle size distribution. FE tests were conducted at two concentrations (1.5\u202fmg/m3 and 2.5\u202fmg/m3) and two flow rates (equivalent to 40 and 80\u202fl/min through 15.9\u202fcm2 sections of each RP type). Each material was held in a sample holder and PM2.5 dust concentrations were measured both outside the mask material and inside the sample holder to determine FE. A limited number of tests were undertaken to assess the effect on FE of wetting a bandana and a surgical mask, as well as folding a bandana to provide multiple filter layers.\n                  Overall, four RP materials performed very well against volcanic ash, with median FEs in excess of 98% (N95-equiv., N99-equiv., PM2.5 surgical (Japan), and Basic flat-fold (Indonesia)). The two standard surgical masks tested had median FEs of 89\u201391%. All other materials had median FEs ranging from 23 to 76% with no cloth materials achieving >44%. Folding a bandana resulted in better FE (40%; 3\u00d7 folded) than single-layered material (29%). Wetting the bandana and surgical mask material did not improve FE overall.\n                  This first evidence base on the FE of common materials used to protect communities in volcanic crises from ash inhalation has been extended in a companion study (Steinle et al., 2018) on the total inward leakage of the best-performing masks when worn by human volunteers. This will provide a complete assessment of the effectiveness of these RP types."}{"Interplay between food and gut microbiota in health and disease ": "Numerous microorganisms colonize the human gastrointestinal tract playing pivotal roles in relation to digestion and absorption of dietary components. They biotransform food components and produce metabolites, which in combination with food components shape and modulate the host immune system and metabolic responses. Reciprocally, the diet modulates the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiota, which subsequently influence host biochemical processes establishing a system of mutual interaction and inter-dependency. Macronutrients, fibers, as well as polyphenols and prebiotics are strong drivers shaping the composition of the gut microbiota. Especially, short-chain fatty acids produced from ingested fibers and tryptophan metabolites are key in modulating host immune responses. Since reciprocal interactions between diet, host, and microbiota are personal, understanding this complex network of interactions calls for novel use of large datasets and the implementation of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. In this review, we aim to provide a base for future investigations of how interactions between food components and gut microbiota may influence or even determine human health and disease."}{"Variability of single bean coffee volatile compounds of Arabica and robusta roasted coffees analysed by SPME-GC-MS ": "We report on the analysis of volatile compounds by SPME-GC-MS for individual roasted coffee beans. The aim was to understand the relative abundance and variability of volatile compounds between individual roasted coffee beans at constant roasting conditions. Twenty-five batches of Arabica and robusta species were sampled from 13 countries, and 10 single coffee beans randomly selected from each batch were individually roasted in a fluidised-bed roaster at 210\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fmin. High variability (CV\u202f=\u202f14.0\u201353.3%) of 50 volatile compounds in roasted coffee was obtained within batches (10 beans per batch). Phenols and heterocyclic nitrogen compounds generally had higher intra-batch variation, while ketones were the most uniform compounds (CV\u202f<\u202f20%). The variation between batches was much higher, with the CV ranging from 15.6 to 179.3%. The highest variation was observed for 2,3-butanediol, 3-ethylpyridine and hexanal. It was also possible to build classification models based on geographical origin, obtaining 99.5% and 90.8% accuracy using LDA or MLR classifiers respectively, and classification between Arabica and robusta beans. These results give further insight into natural variation of coffee aroma and could be used to obtain higher quality and more consistent final products. Our results suggest that coffee volatile concentration is also influenced by other factors than simply the roasting degree, especially green coffee composition, which is in turn influenced by the coffee species, geographical origin, ripening stage and pre- and post-harvest processing."}{"Evaluation of probiotic Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 viability after tea and coffee brewing and its growth in GIT hostile environment ": "In recent years, probiotic functional foods have gained quite a popularity and become a preferred choice among consumers, due to their positive effects on the gut microbiota and overall health. However, it is imperative for a probiotic strain to remain live and active at the time of consumption in high enough population density, in order to provide such health benefits. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 spore stability after tea and coffee brewing and its subsequent growth in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) hostile environment. B. coagulans MTCC 5856 showed remarkable survival (94.94% and 99.76% in unroasted green coffee and tea, respectively) after brewing conditions and was able to grow in GIT hostile conditions using tea and coffee as a sole nutritional source. B. coagulans MTCC 5856 inclusion in tea and coffee after brewing did not significantly (P\u202f>\u202f.05) alter the sensory profile when compared to that without the probiotic inclusion. Moreover, B. coagulans MTCC 5856 growth was significantly (P\u202f<\u202f.05) higher when water soluble fibers were added during brewing, suggesting a synergistic property. It showed over 99% viability (P\u202f>\u202f.05) in tea and coffee powder at room temperature up to 24\u202fmonths of storage. This study demonstrated the stability of the tested probiotic strain B. coagulans MTCC 5856 after tea and coffee brewing and its growth in GIT hostile environment, thereby suggesting functional probiotic use in tea and coffee."}{"Production, digestibility and allergenicity of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) protein isolates ": "Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), traditionally cultivated for industrial use and harvested for fibers and seeds, has raised much interest as a sustainable crop in the last years. Recently, hemp seeds and derived oil have started to be used in a variety of food products. Hemp-based food products are considered less allergenic than those from other edible seeds, although this statement has never been experimentally verified. In this study high purity grade hemp flour (HF) and hemp protein isolate (HPI) were obtained through a fast and cheap process starting from defatted hemp cakes, a residue of hempseed oil extraction. HPI resulted enriched at nearly 86% protein, mainly constituted by the storage protein edestin (accounting for 70% total protein). In vitro protein digestibility was determined using a static model of gastrointestinal digestion (GID), which included a final step with purified brush border membrane (BBM) enzyme preparations. HF and HPI showed a high degree of digestibility. The survival of potential bioactive and/or allergenic peptide sequences in digests was investigated by peptidomic analysis. Only a limited number of sequences survived GID. Among them, fragments from 12 seed proteins. These fragments were precursors of sequences with potential bioactive peptides, which might justify the bioactivity of HPI hydrolysates, reported in previous studies. More importantly, all known hemp allergens, including the major thaumatin-like protein and LTP, were entirely eliminated by the HPI production process, neither fragments of the proteins were present after GID. These data support the use of HPI as an ingredient for hypoallergenic foods."}{"Active packaging films with natural antioxidants to be used in meat industry: A review ": "Spoilage of meat products during processing, distribution and exposure in the markets have an important negative impact on meat industry from an economic point of view. Two of the main problems of meat and products during processing and subsequent storage are lipid oxidation and deterioration due to microorganism growth. In this context, several packaging alternatives have been developed by meat industry in order to limit these losses and to extend the meat products\u00b4 shelf life. Over the last years, the use of active packaging has been proposed as an alternative to traditional packaging. The principle of active packaging, particularly antioxidant active packaging, consists of including active agents in the packaging which interact with meat and/or its environment, either by trapping pro-oxidant compounds or by releasing antioxidant compounds in order to delay degradation due to lipid oxidation. Therefore, the use of active packaging is presented as a future option to solve the problems derived from oxidative deterioration of meat and meat products. However, its use will depend on the costs involved in the development of this active packaging. Therefore, this review will give an overview about the use of active packaging and natural antioxidants, the active film development techniques, as well as the use of biopolymers as substitutes for synthetic polymers and their direct application in the meat industry."}{"Extraction, purification and characterization of pectin from alternative sources with potential technological applications ": "Pectins are defined as a group of widely distributed plant cell wall polysaccharides that contain galacturonic acid linked at both the 1 and 4 positions. The wide use of pectin as an ingredient which imparts rheological and textural properties to various food products and the development of applications beyond the food industry have brought about its increase in production and influenced research towards alternative sources and improving the overall isolation process of pectic polysaccharides. In this context, this paper aims to give a complete perspective on the current state of pectin research by mainly focusing on recent research on the extraction of pectin from other feasible sources, on the post-extraction stages of pectin recovery from plant materials (purification and fractionation), and, finally, on the advancements in the study of the physical, chemical, rheological, and functional properties of pectin."}{"Alkali activation behaviour of un-calcined montmorillonite and illite clay minerals ": "Using alkali activation, un-calcined soils have potential as precursors for low carbon, low cost, geopolymer-stabilised construction materials. This technology has been recently promoted as a lower impact alternative to cement stabilisation for walling materials in construction around the world. There is a lack of fundamental understanding around the alkali activation of un-calcined montmorillonite and illite, which, along with kaolinite, are clay minerals commonly found in soils. Kaolinite, as a 1:1 clay mineral, has been shown to form crystalline hydrosodalite when alkali-activated, but 2:1 montmorillonite and illite could form stronger geopolymer structures due to the higher Si:Al ratio in the precursor mineral. The lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms at work with 2:1 clay minerals is a barrier to knowing how viable un-calcined geopolymer stabilised soil materials are for the range of soil types found in nature. In this study, montmorillonite and illite precursors were activated with a range of sodium hydroxide concentrations, compacted, and then cured at 80\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh. The cured samples were characterised using a variety of advanced analytical techniques, including powder XRD, SEM, TGA, 27Al and 29Si-MAS-NMR, and FTIR. For the first time it was confirmed that alkali activation of uncalcined montmorillonite forms a NASH or (N,C)ASH geopolymer as the major product phase, which increases in quantity with increasing Na:Al molar ratio of the system. Although it has a similar Si:Al ratio, alkali activation of illite seems to result in structural alteration and increased porosity for Na:Al\u202f\u2265\u202f0.5. The behaviour of these individual clay minerals suggests that the alkali activation of un-calcined 2:1 clay minerals is complex. Although alkali activation of montmorillonite can form a geopolymer, alkali activation of soils containing illite may lead to poor quality materials. This research has shown that the focus of future development work should be around montmorillonite-based clays."}{"Exfoliation of montmorillonite and related properties of clay/polymer nanocomposites ": "Exfoliating montmorillonite (Mt) to nanolayers is a crucial step during producing clay/polymer nanocomposites(CPN). Only well-exfoliated and well-dispersed Mt. nanolayers in the polymer matrix can significantly improve the properties of the nanocomposites. This review examines the latest scientific advances in the exfoliation methods of Mt., the insights into the exfoliation mechanisms, and the peculiar functionalities of the resultant CPN. The direct exfoliation of Mt. dispersed in water or organic solvents is often intensified by ultrasonication. Grinding of Mt. in the form of solid in a high-energy ball mill can directly exfoliate Mt. to some extent. Exfoliating Mt. for producing CPN is mainly achieved through so-called in situ exfoliation, solution exfoliation and melt exfoliation. The Mt./polymer nanocomposites exhibit typically improved barrier properties, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and fire retardancy. The literature survey suggests that future work should place emphases on developing green and effective exfoliation methods, and deepening understanding of exfoliation mechanisms and the interfacial interactions between the inorganic Mt. nanolayers and organic monomers/polymers. Future research is suggested to assembling exfoliated Mt. nanolayers with functional polymeric molecules or other nano-scale building blocks to produce functional hierarchical nanomaterials with practical applications."}{"Halloysite based nanocomposites and photocatalysis: A Review ": "Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an efficient, relatively cheap and environmentally friendly technology for decomposing various organic and air pollutants. Halloysite is a natural clay mineral usually in the form of nanotubes that has many applications as well as potential uses including photocatalysis. In this paper the photocatalytic activities of halloysite-based nanocomposites in combination with various photocatalysts that have been synthesized and tested in decomposing organic and air pollutants are reviewed. Many photocatalysts have been synthesized and among them TiO2 in the form of anatase, or rutile, or a mixture of both is the most common photocatalyst due to its effectiveness and low cost. Researches by many investigators are summarized and discussed. The possibilities and limitations of halloysite-based nanocomposites for future applications are also discussed and new fields of research are proposed. It is suggested that Halloysite-based nanocomposites are more promising in positively charged organic substrates like tetracycline and Rhodamine B where the organic pollutant is attracted by halloysite's negatively charged external surfaces close to the photocatalysts, than neutral like paracetamol or negatively charged which that attraction does not occur."}{"MgAl-LDH/Biochar composites for methylene blue removal by adsorption ": "In this work, LDH-biochar composites were synthesized in different molar ratios of Mg:Al (2:1, 3:1 and 4:1) using co-precipitation method. The composites were applied to remove an organic dye from aqueous solutions by adsorption. The composites and the pure bovine bone biochars were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG), dispersive energy spectroscopy (DES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The methylene blue dye adsorption experiments were conducted in a finite bath. The results indicate that pH\u202f12 is more suitable for dye adsorption process, with a removal >95% for all composites. The adsorption kinetic was best described by the pseudo-second order model, reaching the equilibrium in approximately 20\u202fmin. The Redlich-Peterson model fit the adsorption equilibrium isotherms satisfactorily. It was obtained a maximum adsorption capacity of 406.47\u202fmg\u00b7g\u22121 at 40\u202f\u00b0C. Negative values of \u0394G indicate the spontaneity of the adsorption process. The positive value of \u0394H (30.72\u202fkJ\u00b7mol\u22121) indicates the physical nature of the adsorption and the positive value of \u0394S (0.1863\u202fkJ\u00b7mol\u22121) indicates that there was a change in the structure of the adsorbent and increased randomness during the fixing of the dye."}{"Preparation of poly(thiourethane) thermosets by controlled thiol-isocyanate click reaction using a latent organocatalyst ": "s\n               \n                  Different poly(thiourethane) thermosets were prepared by means of a thiol-isocyanate click reaction starting from three diisocyanates with different structure (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI, 4,4\u2032-methylene bis(cyclohexy isocyanate), HMDI and hexamethylene diisocyanate, HDI, and a tetrathiol, pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate), PETMP. The curing process has been catalyzed by basic and acid catalysts. The use of a thermally activated base generator (1-methylimidazolium tetraphenylborate, BG1MI), which is an organocatalyst, allowed a better control on the curing initiation than those traditionally used dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) or tertiary amines. The curing evolution was investigated by DSC and FTIR spectroscopy.\n                  The materials obtained were characterized by thermomechanical and mechanical tests. Homogeneous materials were obtained in all cases. The chemical structure of the network was correlated with the thermal and mechanical data determined. Tg values in the range of 75 to 150\u202f\u00b0C were obtained. The thermal degradation of these materials has also been investigated and a complex degradation mechanism, with three different steps was observed in all cases. These materials showed a higher thermal stability than their oxygen counterparts did.\n                  The thermosets obtained using the latent organocatalyst have similar characteristics to the ones obtained by using the common DBTDL."}{"Synthesis and characterization of a novel inulin hydrogel crosslinked with pyromellitic dianhydride ": "Smart hydrogels with pH and enzyme triggered release suitable for colon specific drug delivery were prepared by crosslinking inulin with pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) in a simple one pot synthesis. Back titration, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV) demonstrated that the hydrogel crosslinking reaction resulted in ester linkages and carboxylic acid groups and that the amount of the crosslinker in the hydrogel increased with increasing PMDA concentration in the crosslinking reaction. Thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the chemical change by illustrating the hydrogels changed thermal properties and appearance compared to inulin. This hydrogel showed excellent swelling in water and the degree of swelling was inversely proportional to the cross-linking density, as determined using Flory-Rehner theory. Due to the presence of the carboxylic acid groups in the structure, the swelling was pH dependent, with significantly reduced swelling as acidity decreased from pH\u202f7.4 to pH\u202f1.2."}{"Preparation and evaluation of an eco-friendly, reactive, and phytic acid-based flame retardant for wool ": "Bio-derived phytic acid exhibits great potential to improve the flame retardancy of textile materials, but it has poor washing durability. In order to address this problem, an efficient, reactive, and phosphorus-containing flame retardant (FR) HPPHBTCA was synthesized using phytic acid, pentaerythritol and 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid, and the chemical structure of HPPHBTCA was characterized. HPPHBTCA was applied to develop FR functional wool fabric, and its FR efficiency and washing durability were evaluated. The wool fabric treated with 0.14\u202fmol/L HPPHBTCA had self-extinguishing performance even after 20 washing cycles during the vertical burning test, presenting good FR ability and resistance to washing. The catalytic char-forming effect of HPPHBTCA contributed to the enhanced FR and smoke suppression properties of wool fabric, and the ester bonds formed between HPPHBTCA and wool fiber resulted in the good washing durability. The HPPHBTCA treatment had a negligible effect on the whiteness, tensile strength and handle of wool fabric. This study offers a novel route to prepare the eco-friendly and durable FR agent using natural and phosphorus-containing compound."}{"Recent developments in sensing devices based on polymeric systems ": "This review is focused on the analysis of recent developments in the application of polymers in the detection and quantification of target species. The work begins with a description of the polymers that are employed as sensory materials, covering molecularly imprinted polymers or MIPs, hybrid polymers, acrylic polymers, conductive polymers, polymers with chiral motifs and also the use of polymeric arrays. After the description of the sensory polymers, the different target species which can be detected using sensory polymeric devices, including metallic cations and anionic species, gases, explosives, radionuclides and bacteria or the recent biomedical and biological applications is described. Finally, the sensory devices fabricated using smart polymers, including, for example, sensory devices based on Quartz Crystal Microbalances or the use of micro and nanoporous materials as substrates for sensory polymeric coatings is listed and reviewed. The work also details the different detection mechanisms based on the type of response of the sensory polymers, such as electrical, piezoelectric or fluorescence. In brief, the review details a review of the research work published in the last 10 years in this quickly evolving field, with special emphasis in the biomedical and biological applications, which have emerged recently raising great attention. To conclude, some perspectives and future challenges that must be overcome by this research field in the next years is exposed."}{"Statistical physics of ring polymers based on topological volume concept ": "Physical properties of ring polymers are subjected to topological constraint, understanding of which has been a significant challenge as a fundamental problem in polymer science. Here we overview a recent attempt to describe behavior of non-concatenated rings in their dense solution based on the notion of topological volume. Discussion includes the size scaling and dynamics of rings, and the phase behavior of blends containing ring polymers. We also discuss the bond correlation function of a ring in two-dimension, for which the non-crossing topological constraint plays a central role."}{"Stabilisation of oil-in-water emulsions with non-chemical modified gelatinised starch ": "In this research, stabilisation of oil-in-water emulsions with non-chemically modified gelatinised starch is presented. Thus far only octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modified gelatinised starch has been known to adsorb at emulsion droplet interfaces, acting as emulsifiers. Screening a range of commercially available food starches revealed that a non-waxy rice starch, a waxy rice starch and the waxy maize starch PRIMA600 showed oil-in-water emulsifying ability following gelatinisation. The microstructure of emulsions formulated with 20% oil and 1% starch was stable for at least 3 months. Thermal, crystallinity and molecular property analyses as well as amylose and protein content revealed no obvious link to this property. Nevertheless, this research has provided the food industry with exciting results for the formulation of clean label emulsions. Moreover, it presents a concept for oral release food emulsions with destabilisation via salivary amylase digestion of the stabilising starch emulsifier."}{"Study of the interactions between pectin in a blueberry puree and whey proteins: Functionality and application ": "Protein and fiber, especially pectin, can form complexes at acidic pH. Studies on these complexes under actual food conditions are scarce. The aim of this work was to study interactions between whey proteins and blueberry puree, in particular its pectin, and to evaluate the impact on the functionality of the puree alone or incorporated into a model beverage. After the addition of a whey protein isolate (WPI) into purees at pH 3.5 or 6.5, the soluble pectin and protein contents and the viscosity of the resulting mixtures were determined. The decrease in the solubility of pectin (80%) and proteins (94%) indicated the formation of protein-pectin complexes by electrostatic interactions at pH 3.5, contributing to increase the mixture viscosity. The amount of soluble pectin in blueberry limited the formation of complexes when more WPI was added (5%). Heating the puree prior to the WPI addition solubilized pectin, which limited the formation of insoluble complexes and reduced the viscosity increase. The solubility of the blueberry polyphenols did not decrease after WPI addition. Finally, the non-heated puree enriched in WPI was used to prepare smoothies. This time, the protein-pectin complexation, probably reinforced by the final pasteurization of the smoothies, contributed to reduce the smoothie viscosity and can be explained in particular by particles of smaller sizes. Although the smoothie stability can be improved, the interactions between blueberry pectin in a puree and whey proteins allowed to design a novel functional ingredient that may be helpful in formulating beverages rich in fiber and protein."}{"Enrichment of yoghurt with oat protein fractions: Structure formation, textural properties and sensory evaluation ": "Despite its excellent nutritional properties, unlike other cereals oat displays poor baking properties and therefore is mainly processed in products like rolled oats or serves as raw material for the functional ingredient \u03b2-glucan. During \u03b2-glucan production, a protein-rich fraction remains as a by-product. Functionalisation of this protein-rich oat-fraction and its application as a valuable food ingredient would improve the sustainability of the process. In the present study, oat protein-enriched cow's milk yoghurt was produced. The main foci were on the characterisation of techno-functional properties, as well as on the analysis of the organoleptic perception and sensory properties by a trained panel. Cow's milk yoghurt, following a traditional formulation with addition of skim milk powder (SMP), served as a reference. Oat protein was incorporated using two preparations: oat protein concentrate (OPC) and oat protein isolate (OPI). Fermentation of yoghurt enriched with SMP, OPC or OPI was monitored via pH-value, formation of lactic acid and rheological measurements. In addition, texture analysis and measurement of syneresis were performed and sensory properties were evaluated. Yoghurt containing SMP showed the highest strength in texture analysis but also a high rate of syneresis. Addition of OPC resulted in a product, which combines nutritional benefits with the sustainable use of the by-product of oat processing as well as improved product quality with respect to syneresis and sensory evaluation, especially mouthfeel. In case of OPI, strong sedimentation took place and high syneresis was observed. It is assumed that the compatibility of oat protein with milk proteins is low, which may be compensated by gelatinisation of starch during yoghurt production."}{"TiO2/MXene Ti3C2 composite with excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity ": "Photocatalytic CO2 reduction for solar fuel production has received enormous attention due to its ability for solving both energy crisis and CO2 pollution. However, fabrication of cheap and efficient materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction is still challenging. Herein, TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) in situ grew on highly conductive MXene Ti3C2 through calcination method. And a unique rice crust-like structure was achieved through the uniform distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles on Ti3C2. This optimized TiO2/Ti3C2 composite exhibited a 3.7\u202ftimes higher photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance for CH4-production (0.22\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fh\u22121) than commercial TiO2 (P25). The detailed photocatalytic CO2 reduction mechanism using TiO2/Ti3C2 was confirmed through the 13CO2 isotopic test and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Experimental evidence along with preliminary calculation was also used to further elucidate the proposed photocatalytic enhancement mechanism. This extraordinary photocatalytic performance was due to the unique morphology and the features of individual components in the composite. Namely, fluffy rice crust-like structure of the prepared samples rendered the composite with large population of the surface-active sites. Ultrahigh conductivity of Ti3C2 facilitated the photogenerated electron transfer and suppressed its recombination with photogenerated holes. This work presents a simple method to prepare highly efficient TiO2/Ti3C2 composite for photoconversion applications."}{"Origin of Pd-Cu bimetallic effect for synergetic promotion of methanol formation from CO2 hydrogenation ": "A strong synergetic effect was observed in our previous work on Pd-Cu bimetallic catalysts for CH3OH formation from CO2 hydrogenation when the Pd/(Pd\u202f+\u202fCu) atomic ratio lied within 0.25\u20130.34. In the present study, the importance of Pd-Cu alloy in selective CH3OH promotion was evidenced and correlated with alloy contents quantitatively through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron spectroscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM/EDS), and H2-O2 titration and N2O titration. The surface chemical properties of Pd-Cu combinations were characterized by H2-/CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), diffuse reflectance infrared FT spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally evaluated along with monometallic counterparts. Detailed characterization results reveal a unique shift in adsorption towards weakly-bonded H2 and CO2 on Pd-Cu bimetallic surface which appear to correlate to the CH3OH promotion. DFT calculations on adsorption properties of H2 and CO2 show good agreement with the observation from TPD experiments. DFT study also provides insights into the impact of Pd-Cu combination on the activation and initial hydrogenation of CO2 to formate (HCOO\u2217) and hydrocarboxyl (COOH\u2217) intermediates. HCOO\u2217 formation was found to be kinetically more favored than COOH\u2217 on monometallic Cu and Pd-Cu surfaces. The lowest barrier for HCOO\u2217 formation was observed at Pd/(Pd\u202f+\u202fCu) atomic ratio of 0.33, around which a good CO2 conversion and high methanol selectivity were achieved experimentally."}{"2D transition metal\u2013TCNQ sheets as bifunctional single-atom catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) ": "The identification of catalytically active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) would revolutionize rechargeable metal-air batteries and regenerative fuel cell technologies. In this study, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systemically investigate 2D transition metal based tetracyanoquinodimethane (TM\u2013TCNQ, TM\u202f=\u202fCr-Cu, Ru-Ag, Pt, Ir) monolayers with single TM atoms catalysts (SACs) distributed periodically with high density. We calculate a lower limiting overpotential of \u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.33\u202fV for Fe-TCNQ yielding a higher expected activity than that of Pt metal (0.48\u202fV) for the ORR under acidic conditions. The catalytic performance of Fe-TCNQ for OER is, however, surpassed by Ni-TCNQs (\u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.46\u202fV), which is identified as the highest among the candidates. By applying grafting axial ligands and external strain, the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on TM reactive sites can be further optimized and enhances the activities of Mn-, Fe- and Ni-TCNQs for the ORR or the OER. Here, Fe-TCNQ-Cl (\u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.27/0.55\u202fV), followed by Fe-TCNQ-CO (\u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.67/0.43\u202fV), are predicted as novel, high-performance bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts with comparable limiting overpotentials to those of the best commercially used electrocatalysts, Pt (ORR: \u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.48\u202fV) and RuO2 (OER: \u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.42\u202fV). In addition, the recently synthesized Fe-TCNQ possess excellent conductivity with fast electron transfer during the catalytic reactions. These results show 2D TM-TCNQ monolayers are durable, low-cost, and efficient catalysts for the ORR and the OER in metal-air batteries and fuel cells."}{"Nature of stable single atom Pt catalysts dispersed on anatase TiO2\n             ": "Pt single atom catalysts anchored on the surface of anatase TiO2 have recently been shown to be stable through oxidation and reduction conditions and exhibit higher catalytic activity in CO oxidation than Pt metallic clusters. In this work we unravel the atomistic nature of the isolated Ptiso species on anatase TiO2 thanks to the combination of CO probe molecule Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments with an extensive set of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. We used the stretching frequencies and adsorption energies of CO bound to Pt as a fingerprint of the specific structure of the stable Ptiso species. These consist of Pt atoms bound to two excess O atoms on the surface (PtO2). The excess oxygen atoms on the surface arise from the formation of surface hydroxyl groups, and provide a solid anchor to the oxide support, which explains the high thermal stability of the single-atom Pt catalyst through oxidative and reductive treatments. Beside the single atom Pt species, also models of metallic, Ptmetal, and oxidized, Ptox, sub-nanometer clusters have been considered. Comparisons between characteristics of Ptiso species and sub-nanometer Ptmetal and Ptox clusters demonstrate that the combination of CO vibrational frequency and adsorption energy can be an effective approach to differentiate these species."}
