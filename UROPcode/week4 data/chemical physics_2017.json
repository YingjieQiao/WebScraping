Structural parameters and band gap energies were determined in agreement with experimental data, with errors under 2%. The methods Electron Localization Function and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules were applied to the analyses of the electronic density topology of the three solids. These methodologies indicated that the bonds between the metallic cations and the oxygen atoms are predominantly ionic while the other ones are predominantly covalent. Furthermore, non-conventional hydrogen bonds were identified to Mg-MOF-74 and Co-MOF-74, which were not observed to Mn-MOF-74."}{"The physical origin of hydrophobic effects ": "From the structural studies on water and air/water interface, hydration free energy is derived, and used to investigate the origin of hydrophobic effects. As a solute is dissolved into water, hydration free energy increases, and is divided into initial and hydrophobic solvation processes. In the initial process, hydration free energy is dominated by hydrogen bonding in interfacial water (topmost water layer at solute/water interface). For hydrophobic process, hydration free energy is related to the hydrogen bonding in bulk and interfacial water. Therefore, hydrophobic effects originate from the structural competition between hydrogen bonding in bulk water and that in interfacial water."}{"Insights into the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol on catalysts ": "New insights for the mechanism of nitro to amino groups conversion have been revealed on both N-doped graphene and Ag nanoparticles catalysts, based on the paper assisted ultrasonic spray ionization mass spectrometry: (1) water molecules not NaBH4 are the hydrogen source for the reduced amino groups, (2) NaBH4 could contribute to the ionization of H+ from water, facilitating its adsorption on nitro groups, (3) six different intermediates have been detected to depict the whole catalytic process, and no condensed roots are involved in and (4) this reduction process is spontaneous to some extent, and even without catalysts it is not totally stopped as obtained from the spectral measurements."}{"Fabrication, characterization and gamma rays shielding properties of nano and micro lead oxide-dispersed-high density polyethylene composites ": "Polymer composites of high-density polyethylene (HD-PE) filled with powdered lead oxide nanoparticles (PbO NPs) and bulk lead oxide (PbO Blk) were prepared with filler weight fraction [10% and 50%]. These polymer composites were investigated for radiation-shielding of gamma-rays emitted from radioactive point sources [241Am, 133Ba, 137Cs, and 60Co]. The polymer was found to decrease the heaviness of the shielding material and increase the flexibility while the metal oxide fillers acted as principle radiation attenuators in the polymer composite. The prepared composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (BET) and field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM). The morphological analysis of the assembled composites showed that, PbO NPs and PbO Blk materials exhibited homogenous dispersion in the polymer-matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated that the thermal-stability of HD-PE was enhanced in the presence of both PbO Blk and PbO NPs. The results declared that, the density of polymer composites was increase with the percentage of filler contents. The highest density value was identified as 1.652gcm\u22123 for 50wt% of PbO NPs. Linear attenuation coefficients (\u00b5) have been estimated from the use of XCOM code and measured results. Reasonable agreement was attended between theoretical and experimental results. These composites were also found to display excellent percentage of heaviness with respect to other conventional materials."}{"Applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs): From gas storage and separation to drug delivery ": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of porous covalent organic structures whose backbones were composed of light elements (B, C, N, O, Si) and linked by robust covalent bonds to endow such material with desirable properties, i.e., inherent porosity, well-defined pore aperture, ordered channel structure, large surface area, high stability, and multi-dimension. As expected, the abovementioned properties of COFs broaden the applications of this class of materials in various fields such as gas storage and separation, catalysis, optoelectronics, sensing, small molecules adsorption, and drug delivery. In this review, we outlined the synthesis of COFs and highlighted their applications ranging from the initial gas storage and separation to drug delivery."}{"The in vitro and in vivo toxicity of gold nanoparticles ": "Gold nanoparticles, owing to their unique physicochemical and optical properties, well-established synthetic methods and easy modifications, have been widely used in biomedical science. Therefore, for their safe and efficient applications, much attention has been given to the toxicological evaluations of gold nanoparticles in biological systems. A large number of studies focusing on this problem have been carried out during the past years. However, the researches on gold nanoparticles toxicity still remain fragmentary and even contradictory with each other. This may be caused by the variety in experimental conditions. In this review, we aim to provide a better understanding about the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of gold nanoparticles by reviewing and describing the up to date literatures related to this problem and we mainly focused on these properties such as the particle size and shape, the surface charge and modification. Besides, we also summarized the adverse effect of gold nanoparticles on immune systems and analyzed the origin of the toxicity."}{"The design, mechanism and biomedical application of self-healing hydrogels ": "Hydrogels are promising materials with outstanding characteristics such as tunable and reversible physical/chemical properties, stimuli-responsiveness, biomimetic, and biocompatibility. However, the structural and functional integrity of the hydrogels can be compromised by external mechanical forces or chemical erosion when used, especially in sophisticated in vivo environment. To address this problem, self-healing hydrogels which possess the intrinsic ability of self-repair have been developed to adapt to destructive factors. In this review, we focused on the current advances made in self-healing hydrogels. First, the testing methods for self-healing hydrogels were summarized.

Its white to light yellow crystals have been utilized as substrate in wide range of organic reactions including multi-component transformations. The notability of dimedone is due to the acidic property of its methylene group which is in equilibrium with its tautomeric enol form. This phenomena permit dimedone to be utilized in several kinds of organic reactions eventuated to several organic molecules with potent pharmaceutical exclusivity. The mentioned nature of dimedone in addition with its low toxicity, easily accessibility and handling, moisture stability, and low cost make it interesting for organic chemists.

This study aims to enhance creativity, deep learning and improve teamwork skills among the third-year chemical engineering students using cooperative learning strategy. Complex instruction method is adopted by instructing the students to develop a board game and embed technical based questions, which are related to kinetic and reactor design subject (KRD) and other two courses, as part of the integrated project.

The initial version of this exercise was used with small classes of 60 students. When the class size doubled to 120 students, the previously successful exercise failed. The failure was then used as a workshop example for faculty development. Workshop participants successfully identified a number of details of planning and implementation which could be improved, and the revised exercise was once again successful in the classroom. The results are a framework for design of active learning exercises, a number of lessons learned about how to successfully implement active learning in large classes, and a highly polished 2-lecture unit on psychrometric charts, including two animated and worked examples which form part of the paper."}{"ASPEN PLUS simulation model for CO2 removal with MEA: Validation of desorption model with experimental data ": "The chemical absorption process has been extensively studied as one of the main carbon capture and separation technologies. This process comprises two stages: The absorption of CO2 into the solvent and the desorption, to regenerate the solvent and produce the high concentrated CO2 gas.\n                  Validated simulation models are essential for the scale-up of the chemical absorption process and they are typically validated using only data from one pilot plant. In this work, a simulation model of the desorption column built in ASPEN PLUS v8.6 was validated using four experimental pilot campaigns using 30wt% MEA. The desorbers in the different campaigns varied in the diameters, structured packing heights and packing types.\n                  A good agreement is observed between experimental data and the simulation results of the chemical absorption process presented here. The model shows an AARD (average absolute relative deviation) of 9.2% for the CO2 stripped (kg/h) for the tested 78 experimental runs. The simulated temperatures of the liquid flux leaving the reboiler show a deviation of 3.3% compared with the experimental data. The deviations on the estimation of the CO2 stripped show some dependency on the CO2 loading in the rich amine flux entering the desorber. However, the deviations are independent on the temperature of the rich amine."}{"Recent advances in photocatalysis for environmental applications ": "Advanced Oxidation technologies (AOTs) are gaining attention as an effective waste water treatment methodology capable of degrading diverse spectrum of recalcitrant organic contaminants and microbes. Undoubtedly, photocatalysis is a promising AOT to alleviate the problem of water pollution. Despite recent research into other photocatalysts (e.g. ZnO, ZnS, Semiconductor-Graphene composites, perovskites, MoS2, WO3 and Fe2O3), titanium dioxide (TiO2) remains the most popular photocatalyst due to its low cost, nontoxicity and high oxidising ability. Moreover, titania photocatalysts can easily be immobilized on various surfaces and be scaled up for large scale water treatment. The current review aims to highlight recent advancements in photocatalytic AOTs with main emphasis on TiO2 photocatalysis. This review also discusses the use of TiO2 photocatalysis for water and waste treatment, treating contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), pesticides, endocrine disrupters (EDs) and bacteria using both UV and visible light irradiations. It was concluded that with efficient photoreactor configuration and further studies on the photocatalyst regeneration, TiO2 photocatalysis is a viable option for the reclamation of agricultural/irrigational waste water. Novel doped photocatalysts such as ZnS-CuS-CdS, carbon spheres/CdS, g-C3N4-Au-CdS, ZnS-WS2-CdS, C3N4-CdS and Pd-Cr2O3-CdS have also been discussed.

Especially, the water pollution is growing rapidly due to the wastewater discharge from the industries. The only way to find the new water resource is the reuse of treated wastewater. Several remediation technologies are available which provides a convenience to reuse the reclaimed wastewater. Heavy metals like Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd, Hg, etc. contributes various environmental problems based on their toxicity. These toxic metals are exposed to human and environment, the accumulation of ions takes place which causes serious health and environmental hazards. Hence, it is a major concern in the environment. Due to this concern, the significance of developing technology for removing heavy metals has been increased. This paper contributes the outline of new literature with two objectives. First, it provides the sketch about treatment technologies followed by their heavy metal capture capacity from industrial effluent. The treatment performance, their remediation capacity and probable environmental and health impacts were deliberated in this review article. Conclusively, this review paper furnishes the information about the important methods incorporated in lab scale studies which are required to identify the feasible and convenient wastewater treatment. Moreover, attempts have been made to confer the emphasis on sequestration of heavy metals from industrial effluent and establish the scientific background for reducing the discharge of heavy metals into the environment."}{"The mechanism of the spontaneous detonation of ammonium nitrate in reactive grounds ": "The mechanism of the decomposition of ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and of ammonium nitrate (AN) emulsions has been investigated. The formation of NO gas bubbles at the end of an induction period was observed, which led to the evolution of brown NO2 gas on contact with air. Inhibition of the decomposition reaction could be achieved by reducing the NO concentration in the gas phase, with inhibitors not in physical contact with the reaction mixture. NO adsorbing clay minerals (hydrotalcite) were effective inhibitors, indicating multiple mechanisms of inhibition. A central role is assigned to nitrous acid (HNO2): sequestering NO prevents its formation, base inhibitors keep it in the non-reactive form of the nitrite ion (pKa of HNO2\n                     \u223c3), and urea in acidic conditions decomposes it to harmless N2. Our results have implications in industries where NOx emissions can cause significant environmental problems for both aquatic and marine life as well as for human health."}{"Production and performance of activated carbon from rice husks for removal of natural organic matter from water: A review ": "Adsorption by activated carbon has great potential to improve natural organic matter (NOM) removal from water. However, the high production and regeneration costs limit its wide scale application. To address these limitations, research efforts have been focused on finding low cost materials that can be transformed into activated carbon. Rice husk is one of such materials of research focus, especially in the developing countries, where over 96% of rice husks are generated globally. Although numerous investigations have been made concerning the production of activated carbon from rice husks, the existing scientific information still remains widely scattered in literature. Furthermore, the scientific information regarding performance of rice husk activated carbon during NOM removal from water still remains poorly documented. This review article therefore provides ample information on efforts made by various researchers concerning production of activated carbon from rice husks and its adsorption performance in relation to NOM removal from water. Properties and pretreatment of rice husks in relation to production of activated carbon are discussed. Activation of rice husks by physical and chemical methods under numerous conditions is reviewed. Factors affecting NOM adsorption by activated carbon are briefly discussed. Adsorption performance of rice husk activated carbon is also reviewed with respect to NOM removal from water, and where possible compared with other source derived activated carbons. The data from literature revealed that NOM removal by rice husk activated carbon can be as effective as commercial activated carbon. Consequently, rice husk activated carbon has potential to serve as an alternative to commercial activated carbon."}{"Experimental and CFD studies of power consumption in the agitation of highly viscous shear thinning fluids ": "Mixing of non-Newtonian fluids is widely encountered in the process industries. In this research, we obtained a constitutive expression that relates the viscosity of a mixture of glycerol and a gel formed of polyethylene glycol and Carbomer to the shear rate, temperature and mass fraction of one of the two components. We found that the mixtures of these two fluids were well characterized by a non-Newtonian power law model. We then used a number of homogeneous mixtures of the two fluids at different temperatures and mass fractions in a simple stirred tank agitated mechanically by a Rushton turbine to derive experimental power curves, which we then derived numerically in a CFD model by replicating the experimental conditions. We used a combination of an air bearing and a load cell to precisely measure the power required by the impeller to agitate the non-Newtonian mixtures. The computational and experimental results are in good agreement, indicating that the rheological data and the CFD model are accurate."}{"The viscosity of glycerol ": "The dynamic viscosities of glycerol were measured over the temperature range (293\u2013394)K and atmospheric pressure using a Brookfield thermosel system. The combined expanded uncertainty of reported viscosity is better than 3.0% with a level of confidence 0.95 (k=2). The presented results are in good agreement with most values from the literature. An extensive viscosity database for this substance was developed combining the values of this work with those published in literature covering a wide range of temperatures at atmospheric pressure from the calculated glass transition temperature (T\n                     g\n                     =188K), and measurements of viscosity reported over the temperature range (263\u2013398)K at pressures from (10\u22124 to 3)GPa. The main purpose of database construction was the development and evaluation of reliable correlation models of viscosity valid in wide ranges of temperature and pressure. The physically sound equations of Mauro (MYEGA) and the Bond Strength-Coordination Number Fluctuation (BSCNF) model were used to correlate values selected from the database. From BSCNF the structural effects taking place near the glass transition were discussed in light of results obtained by recent experimental techniques. Some of the tested equations give overall absolute deviations less than 6% in the range (190\u2013440)K, a value which is close the experimental uncertainty. Stickel derivatives were calculated for the correlation equations and they were compared with values found from viscosity data using numerical techniques. High-pressure viscosity data allowed studying the temperature, pressure and density dependences of this property using the free volume theory and the thermodynamic scaling of viscosity. The free volume proved to be more accurate in the calculation of viscosity in wide T and p ranges with average absolute percentual deviations (AADs) ranging from 4% to 14% for data from different authors. The pressure dependence of glass transition temperature and fragility index of glycerol were calculated from model equations being the results in good agreement with data selected from the literature."}{"Multifractal methodology ": "Various methods have been developed independently to study the multifractality of measures in many different contexts. Although they all convey the same intuitive idea of giving a \u201cdimension\u201d to sets where a quantity scales similarly within a space, they are not necessarily equivalent on a more rigorous level. This review article aims at unifying the multifractal methodology by presenting the multifractal theoretical framework and principal practical methods, namely the moment method, the histogram method, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA) and wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM), with a comparative and interpretative eye."}{"Modeling connected and autonomous vehicles in heterogeneous traffic flow ": "The objective of this study was to develop a heterogeneous traffic-flow model to study the possible impact of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) on the traffic flow. Based on a recently proposed two-state safe-speed model (TSM), a two-lane cellular automaton (CA) model was developed, wherein both the CAVs and conventional vehicles were incorporated in the heterogeneous traffic flow. In particular, operation rules for CAVs are established considering the new characteristics of this emerging technology, including autonomous driving through the adaptive cruise control and inter-vehicle connection via short-range communication. Simulations were conducted under various CAV-penetration rates in the heterogeneous flow. The impact of CAVs on the road capacity was numerically investigated. The simulation results indicate that the road capacity increases with an increase in the CAV-penetration rate within the heterogeneous flow. Up to a CAV-penetration rate of 30%, the road capacity increases gradually; the effect of the difference in the CAV capability on the growth rate is insignificant. When the CAV-penetration rate exceeds 30%, the growth rate is largely decided by the capability of the CAV. The greater the capability, the higher the road-capacity growth rate. The relationship between the CAV-penetration rate and the road capacity is numerically analyzed, providing some insights into the possible impact of the CAVs on traffic systems."}{"Some stylized facts of the Bitcoin market ": "In recent years a new type of tradable assets appeared, generically known as cryptocurrencies. Among them, the most widespread is Bitcoin. Given its novelty, this paper investigates some statistical properties of the Bitcoin market. This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process."}{"Modern theory of orbital magnetic moment in solids ": "The magnetic moment in a solid is usually associated with the electron spins but there is an additional contribution due to the orbital motion of the electrons. For a finite system such as an atom or molecule the orbital moment can be readily calculated. However, for a periodic system the formula used for finite systems becomes ill-defined due to the presence of the position operator. In the last decade a modern theory of orbital magnetization that allows for a rigorous calculation of the magnetic moment of periodic crystals has been developed. This article provides a survey of the theoretical development of this new topic as well as recent, albeit a few, applications of the new formula to real materials. Although the original theory was worked out for non-interacting systems, there has been recent progress in the theory of orbital magnetic moment of interacting electrons in solids. To include the effects of electron-electron interactions two approaches have been proposed, one based on current spin density functional theory and another on the many-body Green's function method. The two approaches are very different but both methods provide convenient yet rigorous means of including the effects of exchange and correlations beyond the commonly used local density approximation of density functional theory."}{"Review of Quantum Hall Trio ": "The completion of quantum Hall trio, namely the quantum Hall effect (QHE), the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), has greatly broadened our understandings about the electron movement in solids. Likewise, the discovered scale-invariant dissipationless conduction in these three quantum transport states has inspired us to the development of practical low-power-consumption electronics/spintronics applications. In this review article, we outline the fundamental physics and relations between different Hall effects. In general, QSHE is a result of band inversion due to the large spin-orbit coupling; since the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is well-protected in such QSH insulators, helical edge states with both spin-up and spin-down electrons are allowed and the conduction is immune to non-magnetic impurities. On the other hand, when TRS is broken by either perpendicular magnetic field or magnetic order, helical edge states are reduced to the single chiral channel, which in turn gives rise to QHE and QAHE, and backscattering from any impurity is strictly forbidden owing to the nature of chirality. Moreover, the interplay between this quantum Hall trio in certain conditions unveils new ways to explore emerging chiral materials and related quantum phenomena."}{"Novel spin-orbit coupling driven emergent states in iridate-based heterostructures ": "Recent years have seen many examples of how the strong spin-orbit coupling present in iridates can stabilize new emergent states that are difficult or impossible to realize in more conventional materials. In this review we outline a representative set of studies detailing how heterostructures based on Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) iridates can be used to access yet more novel physics. Beginning with a short synopsis of iridate thin film growth, the effects of the heterostructure morphology on the RP iridates including Sr2IrO4 and SrIrO3 are discussed. Example studies explore the effects of epitaxial strain, laser-excitation to access transient states, topological semimetallicity in SrIrO3, 2D magnetism in artificial RP iridates, and interfacial magnetic coupling between iridate and neighboring layers. Taken together, these works show the fantastic potential for controlled engineering of novel quantum phenomena in iridate heterostructures."}{"Superconductivity in large spin-orbit coupled material IrTe2\n             ": "As a member of transition metal dichalcogenides, IrTe2 is expected to exhibit typical layered structure and show large spin-orbital coupling (SOC) due to the large atomic numbers of Ir and Te. We successfully fabricated high quality IrTe2 crystals, where superconductivity was detected by transport and diamagnetic measurements. Furthermore, linear magnetoresistance was observed over a wide range of magnetic field up to 15\u00a0T without any sign of becoming saturated, which might originate from topological nontrivial state. Thus, IrTe2 could be a candidate of topological superconductors with simple element composition and crystal structure."}{"Moir\u00e9 superlattices and 2D electronic properties of graphite/MoS2 heterostructures ": "Heterostructures of graphite/MoS2 display a wide range of lattice registry due to rotational alignment and/or lattice mismatch. Using high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) we investigated electronic properties of these heterostructures and observed changes in the bandgap as a function of the twist angle between the layers. Green's function based electronic structure calculations were carried out in order to shed light on the mechanism underlying the observed bandgap changes. Indirect coupling between the pz orbitals of the substrate Carbon atoms and the dz2 orbitals of the MoS2 layers (mediated by the pz orbitals of the bottom S layers) is found to be responsible for changes in the valence-band edge. Simple stacking of van der Waals materials with diverse properties have the potential to enable the fabrication of novel materials and device structures with tailored electronic properties."}{"P-wave tomography of Northeast Asia: Constraints on the western Pacific plate subduction and mantle dynamics ": "A high-resolution model of 3-D P-wave velocity structure beneath Northeast Asia and adjacent regions is determined by using 244,180 arrival times of 14,163 local and regional earthquakes and 319,857 relative travel-time residuals of 9988 teleseismic events recorded at \u223c2100 seismic stations in the study region. Our tomographic results reveal the subducting Pacific slab clearly as a prominent high-velocity anomaly from the Japan Trench to the North-South Gravity lineament (NSGL) in East China. The NSGL is roughly coincident with the western edge of the stagnant Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone (MTZ). The subducting Pacific slab has partly sunk into the lower mantle beneath Northeast China, but under the Sino-Korean Craton the slab lies horizontally in the MTZ. The NSGL, as an important tectonic line in Mainland China, is marked by sharp differences in the surface topography, gravity anomaly, crustal and lithospheric thickness and mantle seismic velocity from the east to the west. These features of the NSGL and large-scale hot and wet upwelling in the big mantle wedge (BMW) in the east of the NSGL are all related to the subduction processes of the Western Pacific plate. The Changbai intraplate volcanic group is underlain by a striking low-velocity anomaly from the upper MTZ and the BMW up to the surface, and deep earthquakes (410\u2013650\u202fkm depths) occur actively in the subducting Pacific slab to the east of the Changbai volcano. We propose that the Changbai volcanic group is caused by upwelling of hot and wet asthenospheric materials and active convection in the BMW. The formation of other volcanic groups in the east of the NSGL is also associated with the subduction-driven corner flow in the BMW."}{"Evaluation method for process intensification alternatives ": "A method for the comparison of scenarios in the context of Process Intensification is presented, and is applied to cases reported in the literature, as well as several examples taken from selected industrial practices. A step by step calculation of different factors, all relevant in the chemical engineering and cleaning processes is also given. The most important feature of this new method is the simplicity of arithmetic operations, and its robustness for cases where there is limited information to provide a good assessment. The final calculated value, the Intensification Factor, provides an interesting decision-making element that can be weighted by experts, no matter which level of detail or the particular activity is considered (economical, technical, scientific). Additionally, it can contain as many quantitative and qualitative factors as there are available; they are all lumped into a number with a clear meaning: if larger than one the new alternative is superior to the existent; if is smaller than one, the opposite applies. The proposed method is not to be considered only as a tool for experts in the specific process intensification discipline, but as a mean to convince outsiders. Also, it can be used in educational settings, when teaching young professionals about innovation and intensification strategies. A discussion forum has been created to evaluate and improve this method and will be open to professionals and interested researchers that have read this paper."}{"A review of process intensification applied to solids handling ": "Process intensification (PI) is a strategy aimed at transforming conventional chemical processes into more economical, productive and green processes. Its fundamental concept hinges upon the volume reduction of processing equipment resulting in enhanced mixing and heat/mass transfer as well as a multitude of other benefits. To date, the focus of PI has been on processes mainly involving gas/liquid systems. Solids handling applications have been more limited as fouling and blockages can occur due to large concentrations of solids in smaller equipment sizes. Appropriately designed equipment is therefore a key consideration for intensifying industrially-relevant solids handling processes.\n                  In this review paper, we highlight a number of solid processing applications including precipitation, separation, granulation and milling, etc. where PI has been demonstrated. Much effort has been directed at reactive crystallization and precipitation in various intensified technologies, exploiting their enhanced mixing capabilities to produce uniformly distributed nano-particles. Generally, the objective in many of these processes has focused on transforming solids handling in batch processes into continuous ones with processing time reduction and improved energy efficiency. The review highlights the considerable opportunity for further development of multifunctional technologies in solids handling applications such as granulation and drying, the subject of a European Commission-funded HORIZON 2020 project."}{"Palladium membranes applications in reaction systems for hydrogen separation and purification: A review ": "Application of palladium-based membrane technology in chemical reactions is currently focused on producing ultrapure hydrogen. Due to the environmental concerns and undesirable side effects of greenhouse gases, hydrogen has great potential as an alternative future fuel. Pd-alloy membranes have demonstrated tremendous potential for the hydrogen extraction in hydrogen-dependent reactions. Numerous studies have been done investigating the diffusion of hydrogen through palladium membranes. In this review, the ability of Pd-alloy membrane reactors in the removal of hydrogen from water gas shift, steam reforming, and dehydrogenation reactions is evaluated.

It is highly acidic and contains high levels of heavy metals causing environmental damage. Conventional treatment methods may not be effective for AMD. The need for environmental remediation requires cost effective technologies for efficient removal of heavy metals. In this study, algae based systems were reviewed and analyzed to point out the potentials and gaps for future studies. Algae strains such as Spirulina sp., Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Cladophora, Oscillatoria, Anabaena, Phaeodactylum tricornutum have showed the capacity to remove a considerable volume of heavy metals from AMD. They act as \u201chyper-accumulators\u201d and \u201chyper-adsorbents\u201d with a high selectivity for different elements. In addition, they generate high alkalinity which is essential for precipitation of heavy metals during treatment. However, algae based methods of abating AMD are not the ultimate solution to the problem and there is room for more studies."}{"The effect of alkali treatment on mechanical, morphological and thermal properties of date palm fibers (DPFs): Study of the interface of DPF\u2013Polyurethane composite ": "This paper focuses on investigating the effect of alkali treatments on the bond characteristics of date palm fibers (DPFs) in a polyurethane (PU) matrix, including the bond strength, pullout energy. This kind of fiber treatment is generally used to improve the mechanical behavior of composites. Raw DPFs underwent a surface modification method by alkali treatment with different percentages of NaOH: 0\u00a0wt%, 2\u00a0wt%, 5\u00a0wt% and 10\u00a0wt%. All treatments were carried out under mild conditions without heating for 1\u00a0h. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), tensile properties, surface morphology and thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) of treated DPFs were investigated. The experimental results showed that the alkali treatment can effectively remove non cellulosic materials and enhance the tensile strength of DPFs. In order to investigate on DPF-PU adhesion, the fiber pullout test was also carried out. It was found that the DPF-PU interfacial properties increased after the alkali treatment, especially fiber pullout energy. Indeed the optimal alkali concentration was reported at 5\u00a0wt% in terms of the bond characteristics, and, this is mainly due to the reduction of the amorphous parts of the fibers."}{"Biosorption studies of lead and copper using rogers mushroom biomass \u2018Lepiota hystrix\u2019 ": "This study points out potential of rogers mushroom (Lepiota hystrix) biomass in biosorption of copper and lead from aqueous solutions. The efficiency of biosorption was tested in batch experiments and the metal ion concentration analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The analysis of FTIR spectrum reveals that the metal ions uptake by roger mushroom involves interaction of metal ion and hydroxyl, carboxyl and carbonyl groups of the biomass at optimum pH of 4.5\u20136.0 and sorbent mass of 1.5\u20132.1\u00a0g for Cu and Pb, respectively. Adsorption capacities were found to be 3.9 and 8.9\u00a0mg/g at a contact time of 25\u201340\u00a0min and initial metal ion concentration of 300\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcg/g for Pb and Cu, respectively. The biosorption process follows second order kinetics and fitted the Langmuir isotherm model. The result shows that rogers mushroom biomass has a good potential to be used in removal of metal ions and can be used up to three adsorption/desorption cycles without losing efficiency. Its use in real life situation can alleviate pollution and increase the quality of water for human consumption and sanitary purposes."}{"Torrefaction of waste biomass for application in energy production in South Africa ": "Power producing plants are major emitters of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming and climate changes. In the past two to three decades, attention has been drawn to organizations such as these reduce their dependence on coal reserves which are depleting and focus on producing clean energy i.e. for every ton of fuel produced, 100\u00a0kg or more should be made from clean energy. This has made torrefaction to gain interest as it improves energy content of biomass, a renewable and clean energy source, to levels equal to and sometimes above that of coal. The benefit of this is that, torrefied biomass could be co-fired with coal thereby reducing greenhouse gases and global warming.\n                  In this study, the effect of different parameters were investigated on two abundant sources of biomass in South Africa. There parameters were temperature, oxygen content, heating rate and residence time. It was observed that a temperature range between 275 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C under inert conditions with a heating rate of 10\u00a0\u00b0C/min and residence time between 20 and 40\u00a0min were required to achieve the best biomass with properties comparable to those of coal. This made it possible to co-fire the biomass with coal for energy production at different proportions."}{"Studies on adsorption behavior of an industrial waste for removal of chromium from aqueous solution ": "An investigation on the adsorption characteristics of an industrial waste (Dolochar) for removal of Cr (VI) from aqueous solutions was studied varying various parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, adsorbate concentration, pH. The study was conducted varying contact time, adsorbent dose, adsorbate concentration, pH from 0 to 70\u00a0min, 10\u201325\u00a0g/l, 10\u201350\u00a0mg/l and 2 to 7.5 respectively. The results of this study showed that adsorption of chromium by dolochar reached to equilibrium after 60\u00a0min and after that a little change of chromium removal efficiency was observed. Maximum chromium removal (\u224895%) was obtained at pH of 2 for adsorbent and adsorbate dose of 20\u00a0g/l and 10\u00a0mg/l respectively. The obtained results showed that the adsorption of chromium (VI) follows Langmuir isotherm equation with a correlation coefficient equal to 0.997. In addition, the kinetics of the adsorption process follows the pseudo second-order kinetics model with a rate constant value of 0.821\u00a0min\u22121. Further, the potential of dolochar for the removal of heavy metal was evaluated in a fixed-bed column at bed depth of 2.5\u00a0cm with initial concentration of 10\u00a0mg/l. The breakthrough time and exhaust time were found to be 19.5\u00a0h and 90\u00a0h respectively. Total volume of water treated during the exhaust time was 23\u00a0L. The results indicate that this industrial waste can be employed as a low cost alternative to commercial adsorbents for removal of chromium (VI) from water and wastewater."}{"Biological treatment of distillery wastewater by application of the vermifiltration technology ": "In this study distillery wastewater was treated using the vermifiltration technology in a bid to reduce downstream contamination by the effluent. 10\u202fkg of Eisenia fetida earthworms were used as the vermifiltration media in a 0.5\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202fm x 0.3\u202fm vermifiltration bed over a 40\u202fh period cycle. The distillery effluent physicochemical parameters which included pH, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured every 5 days. The vermicompost which was produced as a result of the vermifiltration process's nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium composition was also determined. The distillery effluent pH changed from acidic to neutral whilst a decrease of 94.9% was observed for the TKN, 91.1% for the BOD, 91.9% for the TDS, 92.4% for the TSS and 89.4% for the COD upon treatment with vermifiltration. The vermicompost, a by-product of the vermifiltration process had a nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium composition of 1.87%, 0.87% and 0.66% respectively."}{"Energy changes during use of high-power ultrasound on food grade surfaces ": "The energy changes experienced during application of high-power ultrasound in cleaning biofilms from food-grade surfaces was investigated in this study. Laboratory scale experiments were conducted using 24\u202fkHz ultrasound frequency with an ultrasonicator capable of operating in continuous mode at nominal ultrasound intensities up to 105\u202fW\u22c5cm\u22122. There are different energy changes that occur during its use; however, three types of energy changes were monitored: electrical to acoustical to cavitation, and the efficiency of conversion rate from one form of energy to the other was determined to ascertain the effectiveness of the process. High-power ultrasound do not leave residual chemicals behind after treatment and they reach hidden spots near and/or welds where biofilms thrives. A Nexus hydrophone was used to determine the electrical input energy and the cavitation energy but the calorimetric method was used to determine the acoustical energy. Values obtained for electrical power density were against the rated maximum amplitude displacement to compare the error when using the hydrophone. Results showed that the energy conversion was low, on average 26% from electrical to acoustical energy and 9% from electrical to cavitation. However, the values were in line with some of those reported in literature. It can be seen that high-power ultrasound does have a strong presence in the future for cleaning biofilms on food-grade surfaces."}{"Optimisation of biodiesel production from waste vegetable oil and eggshell ash ": "While biodiesel has potential in resolving current energy crisis, its production is hampered by both feedstock and catalyst availability. The aim of this study is to investigate the production of biodiesel from waste vegetable oil (WVO) characterised by high free fatty acid (FFA) as feedstock with heterogeneous catalysis via transesterification reaction. The catalyst used was obtained from eggshell calcined at 800\u00a0\u00b0C. The properties of the catalyst were assessed using XRD, XRF, BET and SEM. The catalyst prepared was characterised to have large pore diameter of 91.2\u00a0\u00c5 and high surface area of 30.7\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121. The optimisation study was carried out by using a central composite response surface methodology with reaction conditions of methanol to oil ratio, catalyst loading and reaction temperature. The result showed at 95% confidence level that all the three factors affected the methyl ester yield. Significant yield of 91% was obtained at optimal operating conditions of temperature (65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C), methanol to oil molar ratio (22.5:1) reaction time (5\u00a0h 30\u00a0min) and catalyst loading (3.5\u00a0wt%). The catalyst showed sustained activity after being recycled and reused for 10 times. The properties of the biodiesel produced were within the biodiesel standard specifications."}{"\n               Xanthium \n               strumarium leaves extracts as a friendly corrosion inhibitor of low carbon steel in hydrochloric acid: Kinetics and mathematical studies ": "Corrosion inhibition of low carbon steel in 1\u00a0M HCl was investigated in absence and presence of Xanthium \n                     strumarium leaves (XSL) extracts as a friendly corrosion inhibitor. The effect of temperature and inhibitor concentration was studied using weight loss method. The result obtained shown that Xanthium \n                     strumarium leaves extracts act as an inhibitor for low carbon steel in HCl and reduces the corrosion rate. The inhibition efficiency was found to increases with increase in inhibitor concentration and temperature. Higher inhibition efficiency was 94.82% at higher level of inhibitor concentration and temperature. The adsorption of Xanthium \n                     strumarium leaves extracts was found to obey Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The values of the free energy of adsorption was more than \u221220\u00a0kJ/mol, which is indicative of mixed mode of physical and chemical adsorption."}{"Brewery wastewater treatment using laboratory scale aerobic sequencing batch reactor ": "This study evaluates the performance of two laboratory scale aerobic sequencing batch reactor operated under continuous low aeration and cyclic aeration scheme for the treatment of wastewater generated from a local brewery in Durban South Africa. The continuous low aeration scheme was intended to determine its effect on the performance of the reactor in terms of organic material removal compared to a typical cyclic aeration reactor for biological organic material removal. The performance of the two laboratory scale reactor was determined in terms of removals of chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand. These two parameters were selected because they are priority pollutants and organic components in brewery wastewater. The experimental results demonstrated that reductions in chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand in wastewater generated from the breweries can be successfully achieved using both aeration configurations. However, the treatment efficiencies in terms of the removal of chemical oxygen demand was consistently maintained above 90% and for biological oxygen demand it was observed to be above 80% with the reactor operated under the continuous low aeration scheme performing significantly better than the reactor operated under the cyclic aeration scheme."}{"The effects of mixtures of potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) and isopropyl ethyl thionocarbamate (IPETC) collectors on grade and recovery in the froth flotation of a nickel sulfide ore ": "Potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) and sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX) are commonly used collectors in both the bulk and selective froth flotation of sulfide ores. These thiol xanthate collectors are conventionally mixed together as well as with more selective thiol collectors such as dithiophosphates (DTP) and dithiocarbamates (DTC), in order to improve selectivity. With deteriorating nickel sulfide ores, more selective collectors and collector mixtures are desired for the efficient extraction of nickel. Thionocarbamates (TC) are another group of thiol collectors used for selective froth flotation of sulfide minerals. Thionocarbamates are especially used in the selective froth flotation of chalcopyrite over pyrite and galena, but little is known about its selectivity with regards to nickel. Thionocarbamates are also more stable over larger pH ranges in comparison to xanthates and they possess beneficial frothing properties. This study compared the effects of using potassium amyl xanthate (PAX), isopropyl ethyl thionocarbamate (IPETC), sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX) and their mixtures in the froth flotation of a pentlandite ore. In the mixtures of PAX or SIBX with IPETC, the xanthate accounted for 95.5\u00a0mol% and for the PAX and SIBX mixture a 50:50 mixture was used. This study showed that the highest cumulative nickel grades were obtained with PAX, SIBX and there mixture. The highest cumulative nickel recoveries were obtained with IPETC and its mixtures with PAX and SIBX (50\u201362%)."}{"H2 formation on interstellar dust grains: The viewpoints of theory, experiments, models and observations ": "Molecular hydrogen is the most abundant molecule in the universe. It is the first one to form and survive photo-dissociation in tenuous environments. Its formation involves catalytic reactions on the surface of interstellar grains. The micro-physics of the formation process has been investigated intensively in the last 20 years, in parallel of new astrophysical observational and modeling progresses. In the perspectives of the probable revolution brought by the future satellite JWST, this article has been written to present what we think we know about the H2 formation in a variety of interstellar environments."}{"Laboratory spectra of hot molecules: Data needs for hot super-Earth exoplanets ": "The majority of stars are now thought to support exoplanets. Many of those exoplanets discovered thus far are categorized as rocky objects with an atmosphere. Most of these objects are however hot due to their short orbital period. Models suggest that water is the dominant species in their atmospheres. The hot temperatures are expected to turn these atmospheres into a (high pressure) steam bath containing remains of melted rock. The spectroscopy of these hot rocky objects will be very different from that of cooler objects or hot gas giants. Molecules suggested to be important for the spectroscopy of these objects are reviewed together with the current status of the corresponding spectroscopic data. Perspectives of building a comprehensive database of linelist/cross sections applicable for atmospheric models of rocky super-Earths as part of the ExoMol project are discussed. The quantum-mechanical approaches used in linelist productions and their challenges are summarized."}{"Binding energies: New values and impact on the efficiency of chemical desorption ": "Recent laboratory measurements have confirmed that chemical desorption (desorption of products due to exothermic surface reactions) can be an efficient process. The impact of including this process into gas-grain chemical models entirely depends on the formalism used and the associated parameters. Among these parameters, binding energies are probably the most uncertain ones for the moment. We propose a new model to compute binding energy of species to water ice surfaces. We have also compared the model results using either the new chemical desorption model proposed by Minissale et\u00a0al. (2016) or the one of Garrod et\u00a0al. (2007). The new binding energies have a strong impact on the formation of complex organic molecules. In addition, the new chemical desorption model from Minissale produces a much smaller desorption of these species and also of methanol. Combining the two effects, the abundances of CH3OH and COMs observed in cold cores cannot be reproduced by astrochemical models anymore."}{"Kekulene: Structure, stability and nature of H\u2022\u2022\u2022H interactions in large PAHs ": "We have quantum chemically analyzed how the stability of small and larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is determined by characteristic patterns in their structure using density functional theory at the BLYP/TZ2P level. In particular, we focus on the effect of the nonbonded H\u2022\u2022\u2022H interactions that occur in the bay region of kinked (or armchair) PAHs, but not in straight (or zigzag) PAHs. Model systems comprise anthracene, phenanthrene, and kekulene as well as derivatives thereof. Our main goals are: (1) to explore how nonbonded H\u2022\u2022\u2022H interactions in armchair configurations of kinked PAHs affect the geometry and stability of PAHs and how their effect changes as the number of such interactions in a PAH increases; (2) to understand the extent of stabilization upon the substitution of a bay CH fragment by either C\u2022 or N; and (3) to examine the origin of such stabilizing/destabilizing interactions."}{"Weakly bound molecular complexes in the laboratory and in the interstellar medium: A lost interest? ": "Weakly bound molecular complexes have been studied in the laboratory for more than 40 years. Interest in them was heightened when they were predicted to be important species in the chemistry of the atmosphere and the interstellar medium (ISM) and also because of their unusual rotational dynamics, described in some cases by nearly free rotation of monomers within the complex. About 15 years ago the interest was heated by the observation of microscopic superfluidity in small helium clusters. On the other hand, a number of unsuccessful tries to detect weakly bound complexes in the ISM considerably lowered the interest in their further investigations for astrophysicists. With this short review I would like to show a perspective for future studies of astrophysically relevant weakly bound molecular complexes in the laboratory and for their potential search in the ISM."}{"Inelastic cross sections and rate coefficients for collisions between CO and H2\n             ": "A five-dimensional coupled states (5D-CS) approximation is used to compute cross sections and rate coefficients for CO+H2 collisions. The 5D-CS calculations are benchmarked against accurate six-dimensional close-coupling (6D-CC) calculations for transitions between low-lying rovibrational states. Good agreement between the two formulations is found for collision energies greater than 10cm\u22121. The 5D-CS approximation is then used to compute two separate databases which include highly excited states of CO that are beyond the practical limitations of the 6D-CC method. The first database assumes an internally frozen H2 molecule and allows rovibrational transitions for v \u2264 5 and j \u2264 30, where v and j are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers of the initial state of the CO molecule. The second database allows H2 rotational transitions for initial CO states with v \u2264 5 and j \u2264 10. The two databases are in good agreement with each other for transitions that are common to both basis sets. Together they provide data for astrophysical models which were previously unavailable."}{"Dehydrogenation effects on the stability of aromatic units in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the interstellar medium: A computational study at finite temperature ": "Isomerization, ionization and fragmentation of molecular compounds in the interstellar medium can be triggered by stellar radiation and cosmic rays. In the present contribution, we examine the propensity for isomerization and the relative stability of aromatic rings in the pyrene and coronene molecules at various degrees of dehydrogenation by means of molecular modeling. Using the AIREBO reactive force field and advanced Monte Carlo techniques such as the Wang\u2013Landau method based on suitable order parameters, entire free-energy profiles describing the isomerization pathways and equilibrium properties were calculated as a function of temperature or total energy. We generally find that hydrogenation significantly stabilizes the fully polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, even though local dehydrogenation next to an aromatic ring favors ring opening. The formation of pentagonal rings, a typical defect motif in the polycyclic carbon skeleton, is predicted to be actually competitive with the loss of a hydrogen atom. Our investigation emphasizes the likely presence of defects in astrophysical PAHs, whose spectral features remain to be better characterized and understood."}{"Hydrogen atom mobility, kinetic isotope effects and tunneling on interstellar ices (I\n                  h\n                and ASW) ": "Transitions of a single H atom between local minima on the surfaces of crystalline ice (I\n                        h\n                     ) and amorphous solid water (ASW) are studied theoretically in the temperature range 4\u201325\u00a0K. Binding energies, barrier heights, transition rate constants and the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) with and without tunneling are calculated. Harmonic transition state theory is used to obtain the transition rate constants and tunneling is treated with the Wigner tunneling correction, Eckart barrier correction and harmonic quantum transition state theory (HQTST). The classical binding energies are smaller on I\n                        h\n                      (<47\u00a0meV) than on ASW (<89\u00a0meV). Also the classical barrier heights are smaller on I\n                        h\n                      (<14\u00a0meV) than on ASW (<69\u00a0meV) and distributed over a range of energies, in line with previous experimental observations. Similarly the vibrationally adiabatic ground state (VAG) barrier heights are smaller on I\n                        h\n                      (< 7\u00a0meV) than on ASW (<54\u00a0meV). The surface morphology strongly influences the well depths. Tunneling increases some of the transition rate constants substantially but has a much smaller effect on others. The average KIE for I\n                        h\n                      is higher than for ASW for the same range of barrier heights."}{"Physical and antimicrobial properties of sodium alginate/carboxymethyl cellulose films incorporated with cinnamon essential oil ": "Antimicrobial sodium alginate/carboxymethyl cellulose (SA/CMC) films were prepared by using glycerol as plasticizer, cinnamon essential oil (CEO) as antimicrobial agent, and Tween\u00ae 80 as surfactant. The effects of CEO concentration on the microstructure and physical, barrier, mechanical, and antimicrobial properties of SA/CMC films with Tween\u00ae 80 were investigated. It was found that the incorporation of CEO increased the thickness, water vapour permeability, oxygen permeability, and elongation at break of the films and significantly reduced the moisture content and tensile strength. However, water vapour permeability was reduced when 15g/L CEO was incorporated into the films. The oxygen permeability of films slightly decreased with increasing Tween\u00ae 80 concentration. Moreover, SA/CMC films containing CEO exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. With increasing CEO amount to 15g/L, the inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus increased with increasing amounts of Tween\u00ae 80. In addition, film-forming solutions with CEO were used as coatings for the preservation of bananas. The results showed that the coatings could extend the shelf life of bananas."}{"Fundamentals in the chemistry of cyanine dyes: A review ": "In this review paper, some of the important fundamentals in the chemistry of cyanine dyes were explained. This include topics like structure and resonance forms of cyanine dyes, naturally occurring cyanine dyes, different classes of cyanine dyes and formation mechanisms of cyanine dyes. This covers methine cyanine dyes, apocyanine dyes, styryl cyanine dyes (hemicyanine dyes), aza-styryl cyanine dyes)aza-hemicyanine dyes(, merocyanine dyes (acyclic merocyanine dyes and cyclic merocyanine dyes) squarylium cyanine dyes (aromatic squarylium cyanine dyes and heterocyclic squarylium cyanine dyes), spectral sensitization evaluation of cyanine dyes, solvatochromic evaluation of cyanine dyes, halochromic evaluation of cyanine dyes, cyanine dyes for CD-R and DVD-R, cyanine dyes as fluorescent labels for nucleic acid research, mechanisms of dimethine cyanine dyes and mechanisms of apocyanine dyes.

This special and/or specific type of collective review in the fundamentals, principles, knowledge and/or the understanding of cyanine dyes chemistry has been paid little attention and is lacking in the chemistry literature."}{"Impact of storage environment on the efficacy of hermetic storage bags ": "Small hermetic bags (50 and 100\u00a0kg capacities) used by smallholder farmers in several African countries have proven to be a low-cost solution for preventing storage losses due to insects. The complexity of postharvest practices and the need for ideal drying conditions, especially in the Sub-Sahara, has led to questions about the efficacy of the hermetic bags for controlling spoilage by fungi and the potential for mycotoxin accumulation. This study compared the effects of environmental temperature and relative humidity at two locations (Indiana and Arkansas) on dry maize (14% moisture content) in woven polypropylene bags and Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) hermetic bags. Temperature and relative humidity data loggers placed in the middle of each bag provided profiles of environmental influences on stored grain at the two locations. The results indicated that the PICS bags prevented moisture penetration over the three-month storage period. In contrast, maize in the woven bags increased in moisture content. For both bag types, no evidence was obtained indicating the spread of Aspergillus flavus from colonized maize to adjacent non-colonized maize. However, other storage fungi did increase during storage. The number of infected kernels did not increase in the PICS bags, but the numbers in the woven bags increased significantly. The warmer environment in Arkansas resulted in significantly higher insect populations in the woven bags than in Indiana. Insects in the PICS bags remained low at both locations. This study demonstrates that the PICS hermetic bags are effective at blocking the effects of external humidity fluctuations as well as the spread of fungi to non-infected kernels."}{"Damage potential of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) on cocoa beans: Effect of initial adult population density and post infestation storage time ": "The effect of different initial adult population densities of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) at several post infestation storage times on the final adult population density, the percentage of damaged beans, the percentage of weight loss, and the weight of insect feeding residues on cocoa beans was investigated in laboratory experiments. Both factors interactively had highly significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) effects on variables assessed. The highest mean final adult population density of 129.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6 was recorded in samples infested with the highest initial adult population density and stored for 150\u00a0d, while the least mean adult population density of 10.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54 was recorded on samples infested with the lowest initial adult population density in samples stored for 30\u00a0d. The highest percentage damaged cocoa beans 51.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.21% was recorded in samples infested with the highest initial adult population density, while the least mean percentage damaged beans of 16.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.26% was also recorded on samples infested with the lowest initial adult population density. Similar trends of means were recorded for all the remaining variables. Correlation between factors was significant and positive. Multiple and simple linear regressions analyses were also significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and all equations fitted the regression models and perfectly described the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables. Our results show that T.\u00a0castaneum can impact negatively on both the quantity and quality of stored cocoa within just 30 days of infestation, with the impact increasing with increasing population density and post infestation storage time."}{"PICS bags safely store unshelled and shelled groundnuts in Niger ": "We conducted an experiment in Niger to evaluate the performance of hermetic triple layer (Purdue Improved Crop Storage- PICS) bags for the preservation of shelled and unshelled groundnut Arachis hypogaea L. Naturally-infested groundnut was stored in PICS bags and woven bags for 6.7 months. After storage, the average oxygen level in the PICS bags fell from 21% to 18% (v/v) and 21%\u201315% (v/v) for unshelled and shelled groundnut, respectively. Identified pests present in the stored groundnuts were Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton) and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens). After 6.7 months of storage, in the woven bag, there was a large increase in the pest population accompanied by a weight loss of 8.2% for unshelled groundnuts and 28.7% for shelled groundnut. In PICS bags for both shelled and unshelled groundnuts, by contrast, the density of insect pests did not increase, there was no weight loss, and the germination rate was the same compared to that recorded at the beginning of the experiment. Storing shelled groundnuts in PICS bags is the most cost-effective way as it increases the quantity of grain stored."}{"Accident tolerant fuel cladding development: Promise, status, and challenges ": "The motivation for transitioning away from zirconium-based fuel cladding in light water reactors to significantly more oxidation-resistant materials, thereby enhancing safety margins during severe accidents, is laid out. A review of the development status for three accident tolerant fuel cladding technologies, namely coated zirconium-based cladding, ferritic alumina-forming alloy cladding, and silicon carbide fiber\u2013reinforced silicon carbide matrix composite cladding, is offered. Technical challenges and data gaps for each of these cladding technologies are highlighted. Full development towards commercial deployment of these technologies is identified as a high priority for the nuclear industry."}{"XRD-based quantitative analysis of clay minerals using reference intensity ratios, mineral intensity factors, Rietveld, and full pattern summation methods: A critical review ": "The quantification of clay minerals is essential for the evaluation of clay-rich rock and soil, but it remains challenging due to the unique structures and various element compositions of clay minerals. In this article, several quantification methods for clay minerals sourced from X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, mainly recommending the reference intensity ratio (RIR), mineral intensity factor (MIF), Rietveld, and full pattern summation methods are reviewed. Principles and applications of these methods are focused upon in addition to related differences in the analysis of clay minerals (i.e., sample preparation, the selection of characteristic reflections for quantification and standards added during analysis). This critical review also provides a proposal for selection of an adaptive XRD quantification method to be applied to various clay-rich samples."}{"Trace element analyses of fluid inclusions using laser ablation ICP-MS ": "Fluid inclusions are records of the physico-chemical conditions of \ufb02uid\u2013rock interactions during magmatism, mineralization and fluid percolation and mixing processes. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a powerful tool for in situ analyses of small samples at micrometer levels. Here we report in situ analyses of fluid inclusions using LA-ICP-MS method. NIST SRM glasses and 23Na are generally used as external and internal standards for LA-ICP-MS analysis of fluid inclusion, respectively, although the RSD of microthermometric estimation of 23Na is about 20% and even worse, the background signal of Na is high for most ICP-MS. Using well-characterized natural fluids inclusion, we show that RESOlution S-155 laser system analyze fluid inclusions in quartz and determine the trace element concentrations. Resonetics RESOlution S-155 laser has the advantage of the motorized Z stage can be used to accommodate variation of sample height or sample topography and height difference between samples, which is very important for analyzing the fluid inclusion in quartz. Our results suggest laser energy density is 25\u00a0J/cm2, laser pulse repetition rates are commonly between 6 and 10\u00a0Hz to avoid the fissuring of quartz and obtain adequate results. For this LA-ICP-MS analysis, uncertainty on 35Cl content is around 40% because of intensity of the 35Cl signal is three orders of magnitude less intense than the intensity of the 23Na signal. Nevertheless, it is still a useful reference for fluid inclusion analyses in addition to 23Na. This technique can be applied to a range of hydrothermal geology problems, including determining the origins of ore forming brines and ore deposition processes, mapping metamorphic and hydrothermal \ufb02uid provinces and pathways, and constraining the effects of \ufb02uid\u2013rock reactions and \ufb02uid mixing."}{"Development of CA-ID-TIMS zircon U\u2013Pb dating technique at Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences ": "U\u2013Pb geochronology using isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) is by far the most precise analytical technique.

Also, more and more Chinese researchers perform lots of laboratory work in improving the technique in China. Here we present the running condition, procedural blanks and zircon standards measurement results in the clean laboratory of the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (GIGCAS). The results show the total procedural blanks (Pbc) are below \u223c1\u00a0pg mostly, suitable for the sample pretreatment and operation. The 206Pb/238U dates of R33 and 500\u00a0Ma solution are 419.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.94\u00a0Ma (n\u00a0=\u00a07; MSWD\u00a0=\u00a06.8) and 500.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0Ma (n\u00a0=\u00a09; MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.84), respectively. These results demonstrate that the CA-ID-TIMS procedure is well established at GIGCAS. Our efforts are beneficial to the development of EARTHTIME-CN program. In particular, when this technique is combined with the SIMS technique, it provides an efficient way to solve a number of geochronological problems encountered in China and worldwide."}{"In situ boron isotopic analyses of tourmalines from Neogene magmatic rocks in the northern and southern margins of Tibet: Evidence for melting of continental crust and sediment recycling ": "Sediment recycling has important impacts on the differentiation of the continental crust, and is considered to mainly occur in arc settings. In collisional orogenic belts, however, sediment recycling processes are comparatively less well understood. In general, sedimentary rocks or tourmaline with continental affinities have boron (B) isotope compositions that differ from marine sedimentary rocks, magmatic rocks undergoing seawater alteration or tourmaline originating from these rocks or fluids. This study uses laser-ablation multi-collector, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICPMS) for in-situ B isotope analyses of tourmaline from the northern and southern margins of Tibet. Tourmalines from the Hudongliang Pliocene two mica rhyolites in the Songpan-Gangzi block and the Cuonadong Miocene two mica granites in the Himalayan Block have \u03b411B values of \u221210.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54\u2030 and \u221212.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04\u2030, respectively. Combined with petrological and Nd\u2013Sr isotope data, we suggest that these strongly peraluminous magmatic rocks from the northern and southern margins of Tibet were mainly generated by partial melting of subducted or overridden metasedimentary rocks with continental affinities due to the contraction caused by the collision between the Indian and Asian plates. Given the widespread occurrences of strongly peraluminous Neogene magmatic rocks in the southern and northern margin of Tibet, we suggest that the recycling of sediments with continental affinity played an important role in the evolution of continental crust during the collisional orogenic process."}{"Post-ridge-subduction acceleration of the Indian plate induced by slab rollback ": "The driving forces of plate motion, especially that of its sudden change over time, has long been debated. During the closure of an old ocean, the subduction process of the mid-ocean ridge provides valuable clues to quantitative evaluation of the driving forces of plate tectonics. Here we show that the drifting rates of the Indian plate were correlated with a Late Cretaceous adakitic event hosting abundant adakites and adakitic charnockites in the Gangdese belt, southern Tibetan Plateau. While adakites form through slab melting, the ultra-high temperatures and dry nature of charnockites indicate major disturbance of the hot asthenosphere. Temporally, the oldest adakite corresponds to the initiation of the ridge subduction, whereas the youngest adakitic charnockite marks the onset of post-ridge-subduction slab rollback (steepening). Geodynamic modeling suggests that the initiation of the ridge subduction was facilitated by the Morondova mantle plume, corresponding to the lowest drifting rate of the Indian plate. Our analyses further show that the post-ridge-subduction slab rollback pushed the asthenospheric mantle backward, meanwhile it dramatically reduced the ridge-arc interaction force, leading to the first abrupt acceleration of the Indian plate. Slab rollback contributed \u223c3.5\u00a0cm/yr but lasted for only \u223c5\u00a0Ma, while slab pull, ridge push together with plume contributed \u223c5\u00a0cm/yr to the acceleration of the Indian plate. Our study, therefore, provides evidence for a new type of driving forces of Indian plate acceleration during the Late Cretaceous Neotethys ridge subduction."}{"Procedure for toxicological predictions based on mechanistic weight of evidences: Application to Ames mutagenicity ": "Typically, (Q)SAR models are deemed decision-making rather than decision-supporting computational methods. In some (Q)SARs, the relation between chemicals structures and biological activity is described statistically. In other models, this relation is based on mechanistic-related events which contribute to the apical effect. Whether the definitive decision is based on a single model or series of models, usually predictions are not supported by mechanistic justification. The lack of mechanistic justification often limits the use of (Q)SAR predictions, especially for regulatory decisions. With this in mind, a workflow based on combining mechanistic (Q)SAR, read-across analysis and expert knowledge is used examine four different scenarios where the workflow provides enough weight-of-evidence, to allow users to make a transparent decision as to the ultimate prediction. When the OASIS TIMES Ames model and read-across analysis based on well-selected analogues within the OECD Toolbox show consistent predictions, expert input may not be needed to make a final decision. Nonetheless, expert input may be useful by adding weight-of-evidence by expanding the set of read-across analogues from literature sources and/or for providing rational of the endpoint-specific similarity between source analogue(s) and target chemical. In cases where there is inconsistency between TIMES Ames model and read-across predictions, expert input is critical for assigning the ultimate effect. Specifically, expert evaluation assists in assessing the correctness/validity of used experimental data, as well as assessing their recentness, presence of S9 metabolic activation accordance to guideline protocols, cytotoxicity, etc. In the latter cases, after evaluating all relevant evidences, expert knowledge provides transparency for the conclusion regarding the ultimate effect."}{"Science data visualization in planetary and heliospheric contexts with 3DView ": "We present a 3D orbit viewer application capable of displaying science data. 3DView, a web tool designed by the French Plasma Physics Data Center (CDPP) for the planetology and heliophysics community, has extended functionalities to render space physics data (observations and models alike) in their original 3D context. Time series, vectors, dynamic spectra, celestial body maps, magnetic field or flow lines, 2D cuts in simulation cubes, etc, are among the variety of data representation enabled by 3DView. The direct connection to several large databases, the use of VO standards and the possibility to upload user data makes 3DView a versatile tool able to cover a wide range of space physics contexts. The code is open source and the software is regularly used at Masters Degree level or summer school for pedagogical purposes. The present paper describes the general architecture and all major functionalities, and offers several science cases (simulation rendering, mission preparation, etc.) which can be easily replayed by the interested readers. Future developments are finally outlined."}{"Illumination conditions at the lunar poles: Implications for future exploration ": "We produced 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0400\u00a0km Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) of the lunar poles from Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) ranging measurements. To achieve consistent, high-resolution DTMs of 20\u00a0m/pixel the individual ranging profiles were adjusted to remove small track-to-track offsets. We used these LOLA-DTMs to simulate illumination conditions at surface level for 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0km regions centered on the poles. Illumination was derived in one-hour increments from 01 January, 2017 to 01 January, 2037 to cover the lunar precessional cycle of 18.6 years and to determine illumination conditions over several future mission cycles. We identified three regions receiving high levels of illumination at each pole, e.g. the equator-facing crater rims of Hinshelwood, Peary and Whipple for the north pole and the rim of Shackleton crater, and two locations on a ridge between Shackleton and de Gerlache crater for the south pole. Their average illumination levels range from 69.5% to 82.9%, with the highest illumination levels found at the north pole on the rim of Whipple crater. A more detailed study was carried out for these sites as targets for a lander and/or rover equipped with solar arrays. For this purpose we assumed a lander with a structural height of two meters above the ground (height of the solar panels). Here average illumination levels range from 77.1% to 88.0%, with the maximum found at the ridge between Shackleton and de Gerlache crater on the south pole. Distances, sizes and slopes of nearby Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) as a prime science target were also assessed in this case."}{"What makes a crystal structure report valid? ": "Single crystal X-ray crystallography has developed into a unique, highly automated and accessible tool to obtain detailed information on molecular structures. Proper archival makes that referees, readers and users of the results of reported crystal structures no longer need to depend solely on the expertise of the analyst, often a non-professional crystallographer, who did the reported study. Deposited computer readable data should allow for an independent structure analysis, validation of the author\u2019s interpretation of the experimental data and use of those data for follow-up research. This paper summarises what is needed for proper validation and archival. The difference between valid and value is discussed. As an example, the deposited data associated with the molecular structure determination of a guest molecule soaked into a MOF, based on the Crystalline Sponge Method, are analysed."}{"Microwave-assisted synthesis of ternary lanthanide(2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone)3(triphenylphosphine oxide)2 complexes ": "We report here the fast synthesis by microwave assisted technique of four ternary Ln(TTA)3(TPPO)2 complexes, where Ln=La(III), Eu(III), Tb(III) and Tm(III), TTA=2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone, and TPPO=triphenylphosphine oxide, which are of interest in luminescence applications. Using this method, the reaction time was decreased to one minute with minimal purification step and the yields are comparable to literature values. The target complexes were characterized using 1H, 13C, 19F, 31P NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Further, we discuss here a hitherto unreported extensive network of hydrogen bonding interactions present in these complexes."}{"Effect of riparian management on stream morphometry and water quality in oil palm plantations in Borneo ": "Large-scale conversion of tropical forests into agricultural plantations, particularly oil palm (OP) across South East Asia exerts enormous pressure on freshwater systems. To mitigate impacts on aquatic ecosystems, the retention of riparian buffer zones along stream banks are often advocated for freshwater management. However, there is a severe lack in ecological information available on tropical stream systems advising on the efficacy of different riparian buffer types (with varying quality) to mitigate stream physico-chemical properties after conversion for agricultural use. To test the hypothesis that greater riparian disturbance will have negative effects on stream geomorphology and water quality, we assessed the impacts of riparian vegetation structure and density on stream chemical and physical properties in different riparian buffer types commonly used in OP plantations subjected to a gradient of disturbance: (i) Native forest (NF); (ii) OP \u2013 forested buffer (OPF); (iii) OP \u2013 untreated palms buffer (no fertilizer and pesticide application) (OPOP); and (iv) OP \u2013 treated palms (OPNB). Across the disturbance gradient, riparian species diversity and density decreased with taller trees and high foliage cover. Foliage cover heavily influenced the amount of light received at the stream, bank and buffer zone that concur with stream water temperatures. In-stream litter substrate decreased with increased riparian disturbance. OP streams had higher phosphorus and potassium concentrations that can be attributed to the use of fertilizers while sodium concentrations were higher in NF streams. Generally, OPF was most similar to NF sites whereas OPOP and OPNB sites had similar characteristics showing that riparian vegetation type influences the physical and chemical characteristics of streams. Thus, the use of high quality riparian buffers with forested riparian vegetation in OP plantations to reduce the impacts of land conversion on streams is supported."}{"Hydrological connectivity drives dissolved organic matter processing in an intermittent stream ": "Hydrological conditions are key drivers of dissolved organic matter (DOM) processing in intermittent streams. However, there still exist major gaps in knowledge regarding the temporal dynamics of DOM processing during drought periods, as well as the role of the hyporheic zone (HZ). We conducted weekly sampling of surface water and hyporheic pore water during a drying/rewetting cycle and characterized DOM by fluorescence and absorbance properties. Overall, the contribution of allochthonous and humic-like DOM increased during base flow in early summer (pre-drought) and continued increasing throughout the drought period, which covered three phases: contraction, fragmentation and dry. The contribution of autochthonous DOM during this period was restricted to very specific points in time (the transition from contraction to fragmentation phase) and space (the HZ). Hydrological connectivity between the HZ and the surface water was a driver of DOM composition by supplying terrestrial, aromatic DOM to the HZ. The disconnection of the stream from the riparian groundwater enabled us to quantify the DOM retention/release in the HZ. DOM mass balance at the stream-hyporheic interface revealed the occurrence of two time periods with disproportionately high rates for DOM processing (hot moments) during the study period: (1) a short pulse of protein-like, autochthonous DOM net release at the beginning of the disconnection; and (2) a longer time period of increasing net dissolved organic carbon (DOC) retention up to 30% along 25m of HZ length during fragmentation and dry phase. Remarkably, the net carbon retention was coupled to a decrease of aromatic and high molecular weight compounds, while protein-like, autochthonous DOM was released. This result evidenced that under drought conditions, the HZ becomes a sink for DOM compounds previously assumed to be recalcitrant in aquatic ecosystems and therefore highlights the importance of hydrological drivers on DOM processing."}{"Macrophytes-cyanobacteria allelopathic interactions and their implications for water resources management\u2014A review ": "Macrophytes and phytoplankton including cyanobacteria are main primary producers in aquatic environments.Macrophytes can maintain water quality by suppressing phytoplankton growth through a number of mechanisms: while e.g. the absorption of high amounts of nutrients and the provision of refuge from predation for herbivorous aquatic fauna are widely accepted macrophyte functions, the role of their release of allelopathic substances in suppressing phytoplankton is increasingly being studied. Some macrophyte species can support the growth of epiphytic cyanobacteria providing them an advantage over planktonic species in the competition for nutrients. On the other hand, some cyanobacteria dominate in eutrophic water bodies and produce cyanotoxins that exert allelopathic substances which may contribute to the decline of macrophytes. Macrophytes can interact with these cyanotoxins in different ways including bioaccumulation and biotransformation. This review focuses on such allelopathic interactions between macrophytes and toxic cyanobacteria. The article also suggests methods for researchers and water resources managers for the application of macrophytes to control harmful cyanobacterial blooms and as phytoremediators for toxin elimination from water bodies."}{"Microplastics in freshwater systems: A review on occurrence, environmental effects, and methods for microplastics detection ": "The continuous increase in synthetic plastic production and poor management in plastic waste have led to a tremendous increase in the dumping into our aqueous environment. Consequently, microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5\u202fmm are produced and stay in both seawater and freshwater environment. The presence of microplastics as a new type of emerging contaminant has become a great issue of concerns from public and government authorities. The sources of microplastics to freshwater systems are many with the largest portion from wastewater treatment plants. The abundance of microplastics varies with the location, from above 1 million pieces per cubic meter to less than 1 piece in 100 cubic meters.\n                  Microplastics can cause several harmful physical effects on humans and living organisms through such mechanisms as entanglement and ingestion. The microplastics can act as carriers of various toxins such as additives from industrial production processes and persistent contaminants by the sorption in waters. Those toxins may cause great health problems to humans. A few studies on the fishes demonstrated that the microplastics and the associated toxins are bio-accumulated and cause such problems as intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles.\n                  In studies of microplastics, fresh water is first sampled by the nets with typical mesh size of 330\u202f\u03bcm for collection of microplastics. After the volume reducing process, the samples will then go through the purification process including density separation by such inorganic salts as sodium chloride and digestion process by oxidizing agents or enzymes. The sequence of these two processes (namely purification and digestion) is dependent on the sample type. The purified samples can be studied by several analytical methods. The commonly used methods for the qualification studies are FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and liquid chromatography. A tagging method can be used in the quantification study. Our literature study finds that there is still no universal accepted quantification and qualification tools of microplastics in fresh waters. More work is anticipated so as to obtain accurate information on microplastics in freshwater, which can then be used for the better assessment of the environmental risk."}{"Solutions to microplastic pollution \u2013 Removal of microplastics from wastewater effluent with advanced wastewater treatment technologies ": "Conventional wastewater treatment with primary and secondary treatment processes efficiently remove microplastics (MPs) from the wastewater. Despite the efficient removal, final effluents can act as entrance route of MPs, given the large volumes constantly discharged into the aquatic environments. This study investigated the removal of MPs from effluent in four different municipal wastewater treatment plants utilizing different advanced final-stage treatment technologies. The study included membrane bioreactor treating primary effluent and different tertiary treatment technologies (discfilter, rapid sand filtration and dissolved air flotation) treating secondary effluent. The MBR removed 99.9% of MPs during the treatment (from 6.9 to 0.005\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121), rapid sand filter 97% (from 0.7 to 0.02\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121), dissolved air flotation 95% (from 2.0 to 0.1\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121) and discfilter 40\u201398.5% (from 0.5 \u2013 2.0 to 0.03\u20130.3\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121) of the MPs during the treatment. Our study shows that with advanced final-stage wastewater treatment technologies WWTPs can substantially reduce the MP pollution discharged from wastewater treatment plants into the aquatic environments."}{"Analysis of microplastics in water by micro-Raman spectroscopy: Release of plastic particles from different packaging into mineral water ": "Microplastics are anthropogenic contaminants which have been found in oceans, lakes and rivers. Investigations focusing on drinking water are rare and studies have mainly been using micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (\u03bc-FT-IR). A major limitation of this technique is its inability to detect particles smaller than 20\u00a0\u03bcm. However, micro-Raman spectroscopy is capable of detecting even smaller particle sizes. Therefore, we show that this technique, which was used in this study, is particularly useful in detecting microplastics in drinking water where particle sizes are in the low micrometer range. In our study, we compared the results from drinking water distributed in plastic bottles, glass bottles and beverage cartons.\n                  We tested the microplastic content of water from 22 different returnable and single-use plastic bottles, 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles obtained from grocery stores in Germany. Small (\u201350-500\u00a0\u03bcm) and very small (1\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm) microplastic fragments were found in every type of water. Interestingly, almost 80% of all microplastic particles found had a particle size between 5 and 20\u00a0\u03bcm and were therefore not detectable by the analytical techniques used in previous studies. The average microplastics content was 118\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088 particles/l in returnable, but only 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 particles/l in single-use plastic bottles. The microplastics content in the beverage cartons was only 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 particles/l. Contrary to our assumptions we found high amounts of plastic particles in some of the glass bottled waters (range 0\u2013253 particles/l, mean 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a052 particles/l). A statistically significant difference from the blank value (14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013) to the investigated packaging types could only be shown comparing to the returnable bottles (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\n                  Most of the particles in water from returnable plastic bottles were identified as consisting of polyester (primary polyethylene terephthalate PET, 84%) and polypropylene (PP; 7%). This is not surprising since the bottles are made of PET and the caps are made of PP. In water from single-use plastic bottles only a few micro-PET-particles have been found. In the water from beverage cartons and also from glass bottles, microplastic particles other than PET were found, for example polyethylene or polyolefins. This can be explained by the fact that beverage cartons are coated with polyethylene foils and caps are treated with lubricants. Therefore, these findings indicate that the packaging itself may release microparticles. The main fraction of the microplastic particles identified are of very small size with dimensions less than 20\u00a0\u03bcm, which is not detectable with the \u03bc-FT-IR technique used in previous studies."}{"Export of microplastics from land to sea. A modelling approach ": "Quantifying the transport of plastic debris from river to sea is crucial for assessing the risks of plastic debris to human health and the environment. We present a global modelling approach to analyse the composition and quantity of point-source microplastic fluxes from European rivers to the sea. The model accounts for different types and sources of microplastics entering river systems via point sources. We combine information on these sources with information on sewage management and plastic retention during river transport for the largest European rivers. Sources of microplastics include personal care products, laundry, household dust and tyre and road wear particles (TRWP). Most of the modelled microplastics exported by rivers to seas are synthetic polymers from TRWP (42%) and plastic-based textiles abraded during laundry (29%). Smaller sources are synthetic polymers and plastic fibres in household dust (19%) and microbeads in personal care products (10%). Microplastic export differs largely among European rivers, as a result of differences in socio-economic development and technological status of sewage treatment facilities. About two-thirds of the microplastics modelled in this study flow into the Mediterranean and Black Sea. This can be explained by the relatively low microplastic removal efficiency of sewage treatment plants in the river basins draining into these two seas. Sewage treatment is generally more efficient in river basins draining into the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. We use our model to explore future trends up to the year 2050. Our scenarios indicate that in the future river export of microplastics may increase in some river basins, but decrease in others. Remarkably, for many basins we calculate a reduction in river export of microplastics from point-sources, mainly due to an anticipated improvement in sewage treatment."}{"Preparation and characterization of 3D printed continuous carbon fiber reinforced thermosetting composites ": "In this study, continuous carbon-fiber reinforced thermosetting composites were prepared using 3D printing followed by characterization of their mechanical properties. First, a 3D printing platform was fabricated to prepare the composites based on Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Then, the composites lamina and grids were manufactured using a FDM-based platform. Finally, the mechanical properties of the composite lamina were characterized. The results showed that the mechanical performance of the 3D printed thermosetting composites was superior to that of similar 3D printed thermoplastic composites and 3D printed short carbon fiber reinforced composites."}{"Biodegradable poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) and PLLA-3-arm blend membranes: The use of PLLA-3-arm as a plasticizer ": "The use of biodegradable polymers in regenerative tissue engineering and bone implants is increasingly practiced in the biomedical area due to their good mechanical properties, good biocompatibility and complete degradation in living organisms, without adverse side effects. Poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) is a biodegradable polymer, largely used in bioengineering, although features such as high rigidity and hydrophobicity limit its use in some areas. The aim of this work was to investigate the synthesis of PLLA and PLLA-3-Arm (a copolymer of PLLA and glycerol) through bulk polymerization for the subsequent production of blends of both polymers at different ratios. This was followed by their characterization through differential scanning calorimetry, FTIR, thermogravimetric analysis, tensile tests and contact angle measurements. Increased hydrophilicity and higher values of plastic deformation were obtained for the materials when the PLLA-3-Arm ratio was increased, showing promising potential for use in bioengineering. The degradation of the samples was evaluated in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for 28 and 56 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PLLA and blends showed different degradation behavior with distinct morphologies, which can be attributed to the presence of Glycerol/PLLA-3-Arm in the formulation."}{"Is decay constant? ": "Some authors have raised doubt about the invariability of decay constants, which would invalidate the exponential-decay law and the foundation on which the common measurement system for radioactivity is based. Claims were made about a new interaction \u2013 the fifth force \u2013 by which neutrinos could affect decay constants, thus predicting changes in decay rates in correlation with the variations of the solar neutrino flux. Their argument is based on the observation of permille-sized annual modulations in particular decay rate measurements, as well as transient oscillations at frequencies near 11 year\u22121 and 12.7 year\u22121 which they speculatively associate with dynamics of the solar interior. In this work, 12 data sets of precise long-term decay rate measurements have been investigated for the presence of systematic modulations at frequencies between 0.08 and 20 year\u22121. Besides small annual effects, no common oscillations could be observed among \u03b1, \u03b2-, \u03b2+ or EC decaying nuclides. The amplitudes of fitted oscillations to residuals from exponential decay do not exceed 3 times their standard uncertainty, which varies from 0.00023\u00a0% to 0.023\u00a0%. This contradicts the assertion that 'neutrino-induced' beta decay provides information about the deep solar interior."}{"A gamma-ray spectrometry analysis software environment ": "At the JRC-Geel's RadioNuclide Metrology sector, a Monte Carlo code based on EGSnrc, and a general purpose calculation sheet implemented in Microsoft Excel\u00ae, have been developed to make the quantitative gamma-ray spectrometry analysis of samples simpler and more robust. The further aim is that the software can be used by non-experts in gamma-ray spectrometry e.g. external researchers using JRC-Geel's facilities through the EUFRAT transnational access scheme. This paper presents the developed Monte Carlo software and the functionality included in the calculation sheet."}{"Low-temperature catalytic CO2 dry reforming of methane on Ni-based catalysts: A review ": "CO2 dry reforming of methane (DRM) not only utilized the two greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4, but also produced synthesis gas, which could be used for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Besides, DRM reaction could utilize marsh gas and the gaseous products from pyrolysis of biomass, consequently increasing their value for businesses and reducing environment pollution, thereby providing ways for sustainable development. Nickel based catalyst was widely used in DRM reaction. This paper reviewed the recent progresses of the DRM reaction at low temperature. Suitable supports and promoters improved the catalytic performance by adjusting the interaction between nickel and the support. Besides, the temperature of calcination, the order of materials loading on support, the reduction temperature, and the nickel particle size also altered the performance of the catalysts. It was suggested that by investigating the interaction of supports, promoters with nickel, as well as their structural adjustment, the development of low temperature DRM catalysts was feasible."}{"Recent developments and applications of protective silicone coatings: A review of PDMS functional materials ": "The classification of silicones in the literature is as broad as their properties and applications; in this work, we have restricted the discussion to polydimethylsiloxanes. Silicones, classified here as derivatives of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), are organically modified inorganic-type macromolecules of silicon with different molecular weights, sizes and chemical properties. The presence of the organic and inorganic components within these copolymers/oligomers/polymers accounts for their multi-phased chemistries since either covalent or ionic linkages connect their hybrid molecular chains. As ceramers derived via sol-gel type routes, some products of silicone syntheses result in functional materials with both physical and chemical properties intermediate between normal polymers and pristine ceramics. Hybrid materials of this kind form very stable chemical bonds on surfaces. The strong chemical bonding inherent within their siloxane (SiO) networks as well as their thermal stability promote inertness against chemical attack, hence, their potential as protective coatings. Products of silicone chemistry are normally applied as films on metal substrates in multi-layered patterns aimed at protecting these surfaces from environmental influences. In this work, several classes of protective coatings synthesized from a wide range of PDMS derivatives have been enlisted and discussed comparatively in terms of their barrier properties. The ease of modifications of these compounds in order to attain improved barrier properties have also been highlighted. More highlights on coating applications with functional materials incorporated with small molecules as well as those whose molecular chains are terminated with reactive organofunctional chemical groups, are also presented. This work is an attempt to comply protective applications of surface and pretreatment films made from PDMS, covering areas of anticorrosion, anti-biofouling, anti-icing, flame-resistance, self-cleaning as well as anti-reflection. The reasons for their unique protective abilities have been addressed for every chosen application, and the influences of precursor chemistries on the physical and chemical properties of resultant functional coating materials have also been discussed. This work also features polydimethylsiloxanes as potential risk of hazardous substances (RoHS) compliant additives in industrial coatings, and as reliable alternatives for chromate/tributyltin-loaded barrier films deployed in the field."}{"Developments in smart anticorrosive coatings with multifunctional characteristics ": "Smart coatings are innovative coatings that can react spontaneously, due to inbuilt stimuli-responsive mechanisms. The functionality obtained from these class of coatings at the metal-solution interface in aggressive environments has led to advances in anticorrosion studies and applications. This review emphasizes the effects of corrosion sensing, self-healing, anti-fouling, and self-cleaning coatings for corrosion inhibition of metallic materials. However, in keeping with the theme, novel coating designs with anticorrosive characteristics that outweigh the limitations in the use of conventional coatings have been discussed. Noting that the presence of high-quality nanoparticles in coating formulations has outweighed the effects of the microparticles. These have triggered unprecedented functionalities in the smart coatings. The smart coatings respond to single/multiple external stimuli such as light, dirt, pH changes, temperature, aggressive liquids, bio-foulant, impact, fatigue etc; and have demonstrated outstanding, barrier properties with scratch resistance, in-situ healing, superhydrophobicity, superoleophilicity, high optical transmission, thermal stability, and resistance to strong acids etc., resulting in extended service life of the coatings and the protected metallic materials. The utilization of smart coatings in complex, real-time conditions, effectively controls the triggers of metallic degradation, structural failures, and resource depletion."}{"Electrochemical oxidation remediation of real wastewater effluents \u2014 A review ": "Fate and health risks associated with persistent organic pollutants present in water effluents are one of the major environmental challenges of this century.

The electrochemical treatment of industrial effluents resulting from textile dyeing, petrochemical, paper mill, tannery industry as well as the treatment of domestic and urban wastewaters are discussed. Furthermore, the combination of electrochemical oxidation with other water treatment technologies as pre-treatment, post-treatment, and integrated treatment is also examined."}{"J-value assessment of relocation measures following the nuclear power plant accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi ": "The policies of population relocation put in train following the severe nuclear reactor accidents at Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima Daiichi in 2011 are examined using the Judgement- or J-value. Here relocation is taken to mean a movement of people that is long-term or permanent. A review is made of a 1992 IAEA/CEC study of the Chernobyl countermeasures, which includes data from which the effectiveness of the 1986 and post-1990 relocations may be judged using the J-value. The present analysis provides endorsement of that study\u2019s conclusion that the post-1990 relocation of 220,000 members of the public could not be justified on the grounds of radiological health benefit. Moreover, application of the J-value suggests that the first Chernobyl relocation is economically defensible for between 26% and 62% of the roughly 115,000 people actually moved in 1986. Thus only between 9% and 22% of the 335,000 people finally relocated after Chernobyl were justifiable, based on the J-value and the data available. Nor does the J-value support the relocation of the 160,000 people moved out on a long-term basis after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. The J-value results for these very severe nuclear accidents should inform the decisions of those deciding how best to respond to a big nuclear accident in the future. The overall conclusion is that relocation should be used sparingly if at all after any major nuclear accident. It is recognised that medical professionals are seeking a good way to communicate radiation risks in response to frequent requests from the general public for information and explanation in a post-accident situation. Radiation-induced loss of life expectancy, which lies at the heart of the application of the J-value to nuclear accidents, is proposed as an information-rich yet easy to understand statistic that the medical profession and others may find helpful in this regard."}{"Spatial characteristics of heavy metal pollution and the potential ecological risk of a typical mining area: A case study in China ": "The goal of the presented research was to evaluate the possible heavy metal pollution in soil by applying Hakanson risk evaluation method with adjusting assessment domain combined with ArcGIS technology. The assessment standards were adjusted based on the amount and types of studied heavy metals. Topsoil samples in mining area were collected and tested the content of five kinds of heavy metals, Arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn). The area of different risk levels and the area ratio in each township were accurately calculate, and the regions with high pollution risk were further precisely located. The results indicate the following: (1) It was observed that the accuracy of soil-heavy metal assessment in Suxian was evidently improved by using Hakanson potential ecological risk with assessment domain adjustment. (2) The single factor and Nemero pollution indexes showed an evident contamination of five types of heavy metals in Suxian. (3) There is a high index of comprehensive ecological risk in Suxian; approximately 82.9% of Suxian is at a strong (level 3 or higher) risk level, demonstrating serious soil pollution. The quite strong risk region with the portion of 18.33% of total area is primarily concentrated in the area of the large Polymetallic mine and coal mining area. Using the single factor ecological risk index, the distribution of large areas of As and Pb high-risk pollution were explored. More than half of the soil in Suxian presents a strong Hg (level 3 and higher) risk level, and the primary strong ecological risk and quite strong ecological risk townships were identified as well. (4) A more finely characterized pollution status was achieved from this pollution assessment in Suxian based on the township level, rendering the study results a more practical guide and increasing their significance."}{"Coping after a big nuclear accident ": ""}{"Peng-Robinson equation of state: 40 years through cubics ": "Since its publication in 1976, the Peng & Robinson equation of state (PR EoS) has become one of the most useful and successfully applied models for thermodynamic and volumetric calculations in both industrial and academic fields. For this reason, we have reviewed this cubic EoS, in order to explore the development around it and some general applications where it has been applied, including its most known modifications. So, a complete time-line of the PR EoS is presented, as a compilation of more than 200 modifications for pure compound applications and about 100 modifications for mixtures.\n                  These modifications to the PR EoS have been grouped in four main categories according to the nature of the modification: (a) by changing the dependence structure of \u03b1 with temperature or the expressions for parameter a and b, (b) by introducing deviation functions (like volume translation), (c) by incorporating new parameters or terms in the equation of state, and finally (d) by modifying the mixing rules for mixture applications. Although great efforts have been made to improve accuracy and performance of the PR EoS, as demonstrated by the wide range of modifications, the necessity for further development of a universal, simple and accurate model is a rich source for research and discussion, considering the success of most of modifications is restricted to the studied properties and compounds, and therefore, they are limited to be just applied to the studied field. However, after 40 years, PR is still an invaluable and prominent tool, which will be under continuous development and research for next decades."}{"Development of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents for extraction of pesticides from aqueous environments ": "Wastewater treatment plants do not properly address the removal of emerging micropollutants, such as pesticides, and thus these compounds contaminate water sources of public drinking water systems. In this context, this work focuses on the development of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs), as cheap extractants for the removal of four neonicotinoids, Imidacloprid, Acetamiprid, Nitenpyram and Thiamethoxam, from diluted aqueous solutions. In particular, two different families of DESs, one based on natural neutral ingredients (DL-Menthol and natural organic acids) and the other based on quaternary ammonium salts and organic acids were prepared and their water stability carefully studied through 1H NMR. Only the chemically stable DESs were selected to be used as solvents in the extraction of the four neonicotinoids so that no contamination of the water cycle is attained, while reuse of the DES is possible. The final results were compared with those obtained for liquid-liquid extraction using hydrophobic imidazolium-based ionic liquids as solvents."}{"Thermodynamic models to accurately describe the \n                  \n                     P\n                     V\n                     T\n                     x\n                     y\n                  \n               -behavior of water / carbon dioxide mixtures ": "Carbon dioxide/water (CO2/H2O) mixtures are of much interest in carbon capture and storage, atmospheric science, in the description of human lungs and in the processing of food and beverages.

We test the predictive ability of the models by comparing to data outside of the region used in the parameter-fit. All of the thermodynamic models are fitted with the same experimental data and compared on the same basis, facilitating a general discussion about their strengths and weaknesses. As a benchmark for the performance of the models, we compare with the performance of two multiparameter EoS: GERG-2008 and EoS-CG.

Many methods used to remediate AMD are limited in implementation due to poor performance, design inaccuracies, difficult understanding of functionality, high costs, usage of hazardous chemicals, depletion of natural resources and the generation of further waste. As a result of these limitations, and due to the need for sustainability, research is being conducted on the use of waste materials and by-products from other industries, such as the dairy, paper mill, steel mill, wine, tyre, seafood and even from AMD treatment itself, to remediate AMD. Materials from these industries have been shown to reduce or eliminate some of the drawbacks of conventional techniques and technologies such as lime neutralization, passivation, in-situ biological remediation, backfilling, waste-heap covers, adsorption, constructed wetlands, desalination, sulfidogenic bioreactors, anoxic limestone drains and permeable reactive barriers. This paper presents an overview of AMD and discusses research developments into various waste materials or by-products from other industries that have been successfully applied in remediating AMD."}{"Advance review on the exploitation of the prominent energy-storage element Lithium. Part II: From sea water and spent lithium ion batteries (LIBs) ": "The uncertainty in production and utilization with the availability of lithium rich minerals and brine in a limited land area has grown the attention for the exploitation of those resources not coming under a specific boundary. Approximately 230 billion tons of lithium in ubiquitous sea water and generation of a huge amount of used lithium ion batteries (spent LIBs) in different corner of the end-user countries can play a major role to change the scenario of securing lithium as a raw material for industry. Therefore, it needs to be exploited in such an effective manner that it can assure the mitigation of projected supply risk of this energy-critical element. To explore the commercial viability for their sustainable exploitation, it is imperative to review the methodologies that have been investigated and have clear potential for upscaling.\n                  This article deals with the processing of those resources that do not contributes yet to lithium supply in commodity market, and include the lithium recovery from sea water and spent LIBs. A purposive discussion on the electro-dialysis and reverse osmosis for the separation and recovery of lithium from sea water is of vital interest in future. A routinely disposed spent LIBs is a huge reservoir of lithium and need to be recovered as a main product along with the costlier cobalt, while recycling the spent LIBs. The various extraction and recovery processes of lithium are subdivided according to the adopted methodology, selection of lixiviant and obtaining the product in the desired form, whilst the technological and chemical perspective is also discussed. The deliberations on the edges and/or drawbacks, complications and prospects of the different processes are also included. It is believed that this state-of-the-art review can contribute in formulating the strategy for fulfilling the global energy demand by a sustainable recovery of lithium from its non-conventional resources, and can provide future research directions."}{"Kinetics and mechanisms of gold dissolution by ferric chloride leaching ": "Gold dissolution was investigated in ferric chloride solution, being one alternative cyanide-free leaching media of increasing interest.

Increase in gold dissolution rate was observed with increase in temperature, ferric ion concentration and chloride concentration, but gold dissolution rate did not have a clear dependency on pH. Redox potential was found to vary between 636 and 741mV vs. SCE during experiments. According to the calculated equilibrium and measured open circuit potentials, gold was suggested to dissolve as aurous ion Au+ and form AuCl2\n                     \u2212, rather than auric ion Au3+ and form AuCl4\n                     \u2212.

Levich plot and the calculated activation energies suggested that gold dissolution was limited by mass and electron transfer. According to a mechanistic kinetic model developed in the current work, intrinsic surface reaction mainly controls gold dissolution, especially at higher rotational speeds (>1000 RPM). Uncertainties in the model parameters of the mechanistic kinetic model were studied with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods."}{"Nanoparticles: Properties, applications and toxicities ": "This review is provided a detailed overview of the synthesis, properties and applications of nanoparticles (NPs) exist in different forms. NPs are tiny materials having size ranges from 1 to 100nm. They can be classified into different classes based on their properties, shapes or sizes. The different groups include fullerenes, metal NPs, ceramic NPs, and polymeric NPs. NPs possess unique physical and chemical properties due to their high surface area and nanoscale size. Their optical properties are reported to be dependent on the size, which imparts different colors due to absorption in the visible region. Their reactivity, toughness and other properties are also dependent on their unique size, shape and structure. Due to these characteristics, they are suitable candidates for various commercial and domestic applications, which include catalysis, imaging, medical applications, energy-based research, and environmental applications. Heavy metal NPs of lead, mercury and tin are reported to be so rigid and stable that their degradation is not easily achievable, which can lead to many environmental toxicities."}{"Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis spp.) as sentinel organisms in coastal pollution monitoring: A review ": "The blue mussel (Mytilus spp.) is widely used as a bioindicator for monitoring of coastal water pollution (mussel watch programs).

We conducted meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect using random-effects models and conducted subgroup analyses to assess impact of different levels of sanitation services and to explore sources of heterogeneity. We assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence from intervention studies using the Liverpool Quality Appraisal Tool (LQAT) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, respectively. A total of 171 studies met the review\u2019s inclusion criteria, including 64 studies not included in the previous reviews. Overall, the evidence suggests that sanitation is protective against diarrhea, active trachoma, some STH infections, schistosomiasis, and height-for-age, with no protective effect for other anthropometric outcomes.

However, biological emissions (bioaerosols) from intensified livestock farming may have the potential to impact human health. Bioaerosols from intensive livestock farming have been reported to cause symptoms and/or illnesses in occupational-settings and there is concern about the potential health effects on people who live near the intensive farms. As well as adverse health effects, some potential beneficial effects have been attributed to farm exposures in early life. The aim of the study was to undertake a systematic review to evaluate potential for adverse health outcomes in populations living near intensive livestock farms.\n               \n               \n                  Material and methods\n                  Two electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) and bibliographies were searched for studies reporting associations between health outcomes and bioaerosol emissions related to intensive farming published between January 1960 and April 2017, including both occupational and community studies.

The majority of occupational studies found a negative impact on respiratory health outcomes and increases in inflammatory biomarkers among farm workers exposed to bioaerosols. Studies investigating the health of communities living near intensive farms had mixed findings. All four studies of asthma in children found increased reported asthma prevalence among children living or attending schools near an intensive farm. Papers principally investigated respiratory and immune system outcomes.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The review indicated a potential impact of intensive farming on childhood respiratory health, based on a small number of studies using self-reported outcomes, but supported by findings from occupational studies.

We recruited a residential cohort of 2388 long-term residents aged above 35 years in 2009\u20132012 who lived within a 40\u202fkm radius of the complex. We measured their internal exposure biomarkers of urinary carcinogenic metals and retrospectively compared cancer incidences between those who lived fewer than 10\u202fkm from the complex (high exposure, HE) and those who lived more than 10\u202fkm from the complex (low exposure, LE). Residents had lived in their respective areas for 12 years, since the complex began operating in mid-1999. This included two periods of operation: 0\u20139 years and 10\u201312 years. Crude cumulative incident rates (CIRs) of all cancers were calculated for new cancer cases (ICD-9: 140\u2013165, 170\u2013176, 179\u2013208) recorded in the Taiwan Health Insurance Database over total person-years at risk in each study period. Poisson regression was applied to estimate relative risks for the CIRs of all cancers between HE and LE areas during the 10\u201312 years since the beginning of the complex\u2019s operation, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, hepatitis C, and occupational exposure. We found that our study subjects in HE areas had higher urinary carcinogenic metal levels, including As, Cd, Hg, Pb, and V, and higher prevalence rates of hepatitis C than those in LE areas. After the complex had been operating for 10\u201312 years, SIRs per 1000 person-years for all cancers in HE and LE areas were 4.44 vs. 2.48 for all subjects, 15.2 vs. 4.86 for elder subjects aged above 60 years, and 2.94 vs. 2.71 for female subjects. Correspondingly, the adjusted relative risks of CIRs for all cancers between HE and LE areas were 1.29 (95% CI: 0.99\u20131.68) for all subjects, 1.52 (1.04\u20132.22) for elder subjects, 1.41 (1.00\u20131.97) for female subjects, and 1.91 (1.15\u20133.19) for female elderly subjects. We conclude that elder and female residents living within 10\u202fkm of a petrochemical complex had higher carcinogenic exposure and cancers than those living farther away from the complex after the complex had been operating for 10 years."}{"Digestion of milk proteins: Comparing static and dynamic in vitro digestion systems with in vivo data ": "In the frame of the COST action INFOGEST, a static in vitro digestion protocol has been elaborated aiming at the improvement of data comparability by harmonizing the experimental conditions. The success in harmonization was confirmed with inter-laboratory trials using skim milk powder as a standardized model food. Moreover, the physiological relevance of the gastric and intestinal endpoints of the static digestion protocol was demonstrated in a pig in vivo trial, with the same skim milk powder and samples collected from different sections of the digestive tract, as well as in a human study with from jejunal effluents. In vivo, digestion is a dynamic process influenced by peristalsis and by the gradual secretion of enzymes and juices and the dwell time of the food. To mimic these physiological mechanisms, dynamic in vitro digestion protocols are widely used. Until now, the differences of protein hydrolysis taking place during dynamic and static in vitro digestion have not been investigated. In this study, the gradual hydrolysis of the main milk proteins present in skim milk powder was digested with the dynamic DIDGI\u00ae-system using adult digestion protocol and the static harmonized INFOGEST method. Protein hydrolysis was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, peptide patterns were measured with mass spectrometry, and free amino acids with high pressure liquid chromatography. The peptide patterns at the gastric and intestinal endpoints of in vitro digestion showed a good approximation to the in vivo results from pigs. Moreover, gradual peptide generation was comparable in both in vitro digestion conditions. However, the dynamic protocol reflected the physiological situation better at the level of free amino acid release. Nonetheless, in both in vitro digestion protocols, absorption of free amino acids is not simulated, and they are therefore limited in reflecting the in vivo situation at this level."}{"Emerging trends in European food, diets and food industry ": "Understanding how an adequate food security may be determined, how nutritional intakes evolve over time and are influenced by global dynamics are few of the questions scholars are trying to answer.

Replacing meat in this diet and/or consuming only foods with relatively low GHG emissions resulted in average GHG emission reductions varying from 28\u201346%. In the scenarios in which only foods with relatively low GHG emissions are consumed, fewer dietary reference intakes (DRIs) were met than in the other healthy diet scenarios. However, in all healthy diet scenarios the number of DRIs being met was equal to or higher than that in the current diet.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Diets adhering to food based dietary guidelines did not substantially reduce GHG emissions compared to the current Dutch diet, when these diets stayed as close to the current diet as possible. Omitting meat from these healthy diets or consuming only foods with relatively low associated GHG emissions both resulted in GHG emission reductions of around a third. These findings may be used to expand food based dietary guidelines with information on how to reduce the environmental impact of healthy diets."}{"Some physical and functional properties of finger millet (Eleusine coracana) obtained in sub-Saharan Africa ": "The study determined the physical properties of finger millet (FM) (Eluesine coracana) grains and the functional properties of FM flour. Physical properties such as colour attributes, sample weight, bulk density, true density, porosity, surface area, sample volume, aspect ratio, sphericity, dimensional properties and moisture content of grain cultivars were determined. Water absorption capacity (WAC), bulk density (BD), dispersibility, viscosity and micro-structure of FM flours were also evaluated. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS statistical software version 23.0. Results showed that milky cream cultivar was significantly higher (p\n                     <0.05) than other samples in sample weight, bulk density, true density, aspect ratio and sphericity. However, pearl millet, used as a control, was significantly different from FM flour on all dimensional properties. Moisture content of milky cream showed higher significant difference for both grains and flours as compared to brown and black grain/flours. Milky cream cultivar was significantly different in L*, b*, C*, H* values, WAC, BD and dispersibility for both FM grains and flours. Data showed that brown flour was significantly higher in viscosity than in milky and black flours. Microstructure results revealed that starch granules of raw FM flours had oval/spherical and smooth surface. The study is important for agricultural and food engineers, designers, scientists and processors in the design of equipment for FM grain processing. Results are likely to be useful in assessing the quality of grains used to fortify FM flour."}{"Making sense of the \u201cclean label\u201d trends: A review of consumer food choice behavior and discussion of industry implications ": "Consumers in industrialized countries are nowadays much more interested in information about the production methods and components of the food products that they eat, than they had been 50years ago. Some production methods are perceived as less \u201cnatural\u201d (i.e. conventional agriculture) while some food components are seen as \u201cunhealthy\u201d and \u201cunfamiliar\u201d (i.e. artificial additives). This phenomenon, often referred to as the \u201cclean label\u201d trend, has driven the food industry to communicate whether a certain ingredient or additive is not present or if the food has been produced using a more \u201cnatural\u201d production method (i.e. organic agriculture). However, so far there is no common and objective definition of clean label. This review paper aims to fill the gap via three main objectives, which are to a) develop and suggest a definition that integrates various understandings of clean label into one single definition, b) identify the factors that drive consumers' choices through a review of recent studies on consumer perception of various food categories understood as clean label with the focus on organic, natural and \u2018free from\u2019 artificial additives/ingredients food products and c) discuss implications of the consumer demand for clean label food products for food manufacturers as well as policy makers. We suggest to define clean label, both in a broad sense, where consumers evaluate the cleanliness of product by assumption and through inference looking at the front-of-pack label and in a strict sense, where consumers evaluate the cleanliness of product by inspection and through inference looking at the back-of-pack label. Results show that while \u2018health\u2019 is a major consumer motive, a broad diversity of drivers influence the clean label trend with particular relevance of intrinsic or extrinsic product characteristics and socio-cultural factors. However, \u2018free from\u2019 artificial additives/ingredients food products tend to differ from organic and natural products. Food manufacturers should take the diversity of these drivers into account in developing new products and communication about the latter. For policy makers, it is important to work towards a more homogenous understanding and application of the term of clean label and identify a uniform definition or regulation for \u2018free from\u2019 artificial additives/ingredients food products, as well as work towards decreasing consumer misconceptions. Finally, multiple future research avenues are discussed."}{"Layered double hydroxides: A brief review from fundamentals to application as evolving biomaterials ": "Layered double hydroxides (LDH) which are one type of layered materials and are also known as anionic clays, are promising layered materials due to some of their interesting properties, such as ease of synthesis, unique structure, uniform distribution of different metal cations in the brucite layer, surface hydroxyl groups, flexible tunability, intercalated anions with interlayer spaces, swelling properties, oxo-bridged linkage, and high chemical and thermal stability, ability to intercalate different type of anions (inorganic, organic, biomolecules, and even genes), delivery of intercalated anions in a sustained manner and also high biocompatibility. Considering the previous work on LDH as novel biomaterials, research on this particular materials has become one of the most interesting topic of today's research. LDH has become an important class of layered materials having prospects in the field of biomaterials, wherein great attention has been paid to the biocompatibility nature, exchange of the existing anion with the target anion, holding of guest species in between the interlayer space and its controlled release of the anion in a particular medium. This article, after deliberating the recent significant evolution in the structure and different methods of synthesis of different LDH materials and its applications in various extents especially its biological applications through their structural and functional properties, considers many typical examples. In particular, recent progress on the emerging strategies of LDH to improve their antimicrobial activity is also presented."}{"Removal of Methylene Blue from aqueous solutions by adsorption on Kaolin: Kinetic and equilibrium studies ": "Removal of Methylene Blue (MB) from aqueous solutions is studied using a raw Algerian kaolin sample as a low-cost adsorbent. The effects of pH, contact time, dye concentration and temperature are all taken into consideration. The adsorption kinetics results are adjusted to best fit the pseudo-second order model. The experimental data are analyzed by Langmuir isotherms, revealing that the maximum adsorption capacity of MB on this kaolin sample equals 52.76mg/g at T=25\u00b0C and pH=6.0. The calculated thermodynamic data demonstrates that adsorption is spontaneous and enhanced at higher temperatures. Desorption studies with water indicate that the adsorbent could successfully retain MB, even after four cycles. From these results, it can be considered that the raw Algerian kaolin sample tested herein is effective in the removal of MB from aqueous solutions and moreover may be used as an alternative to high-cost commercial adsorbents."}{"Recent progress in layered double hydroxides (LDH)-containing hybrids as adsorbents for water remediation ": "With rapidly growing industrial development worldwide, the need for a new class of nanoparticles and techniques for treating wastewater remains a major concern to protect the environment. Layered double hydroxides and particularly LDH-containing hybrids are emerging as potential nano-sized adsorbents for water treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated LDH-containing hybrids as promising multifunctional materials for potential utilization in various applications such as, photo-catalysis, energy storage, nanocomposites and water purification.

This is due to the selective barrier, through the thin layer structure, which is called membrane, in which the separation occurs with relative lower energy demands. To this end, many types of materials, commercially available or synthesized in the laboratory, have been tested as candidate materials in various membrane applications. Properties such as, plasticization, solubility in inorganic or organic solvents, high thermal properties, flexibility, mechanical strength are required for the selection of the optimum material for every industrial application. In any case, the major factors that define the selection of a material as well as the efficiency of a certain filtration process are the high permeation and separation coefficients. The separation mechanism in a polymeric membrane mainly depends on material's nature combined with its formation process. Due to extreme differences between the polymer candidates many studies have been reported in the literature regarding the optimum materials for the different membrane types. Polyimides are a very attractive class of polymers that can be used on membrane technology, exhibiting high selectivities combined with high permeances for a large variety of applications including gas and liquid separations. In this article the principle theory of the mass transfer phenomena through polymers and a brief outline of polyimides based gas separation membranes are presented and discussed. In specific, selected works of the preparation routine and the gas permeation/selectivity properties of polyimide based membranes are presented and discussed by giving emphasis on the carbon dioxide permeation and separation properties."}{"A direct Z-scheme g-C3N4/SnS2 photocatalyst with superior visible-light CO2 reduction performance ": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to solar fuels is an ideal approach to simultaneously solve the global warming and energy crisis issues. Constructing a direct Z-scheme heterojunction is an effective way to overcome the drawbacks of single-component or conventional heterogeneous photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Here, a novel type of direct Z-scheme g-C3N4/SnS2 heterojunction was constructed by depositing SnS2 quantum dots onto the g-C3N4 surface in situ via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. l-Cysteine not only acted as the sulfur source, but also grafted ammine groups onto g-C3N4 in the hydrothermal process, which greatly enhanced the CO2 uptake of the composite. XPS analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation show that electron transfer occurred from g-C3N4 to SnS2, resulting in the formation of interfacial internal electric fields (IEF) between the two semiconductors at equilibrium. As a result, Z-scheme charge transfer took place under photoexcitation, with the electrons in SnS2 combining with the holes in g-C3N4, which improved the extraction and utilization of photoinduced electron in g-C3N4. The g-C3N4/SnS2 hybrid shows superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction as compared with individual g-C3N4 and SnS2, which should be attributed to the IEF-induced direct Z-scheme as well as improved CO2 adsorption capacity. In situ FTIR spectra illustrate that HCOOH appeared as an intermediate during the CO2 conversion, which can only be generated by g-C3N4 according to the energy level of the photoinduced electrons, further confirming the Z-scheme configuration for the g-C3N4/SnS2 system."}
