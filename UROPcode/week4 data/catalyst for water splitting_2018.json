{"Microplastics in wastewater treatment plants: Detection, occurrence and removal ": "Microplastics have aroused increasing concern as they pose threats to aquatic species as well as human beings. They do not only contribute to accumulation of plastics in the environment, but due to absorption they can also contribute to spreading of micropollutants in the environment. Studies indicated that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in releasing microplastics to the environment. Therefore, effective detection of the microplastics and understanding their occurrence and fate in WWTPs are of great importance towards microplastics control. In this review, the up-to-date status on the detection, occurrence and removal of microplastics in WWTPs are comprehensively reviewed. Specifically, the different techniques used for collecting microplastics from both wastewater and sewage sludge, and their pretreatment and characterization methods are reviewed and analyzed. The key aspects regarding microplastics occurrence in WWTPs, such as concentrations, total discharges, materials, shapes and sizes are summarized and compared. Microplastics removal in different treatment stages and their retention in sewage sludge are explored. The development of potential microplastics-targeted treatment technologies is also presented. Although previous researches in microplastics have undoubtedly improved our level of understanding, it is clear that much remains to be learned about microplastics in WWTPs, as many unanswered questions and thereby concerns still remain; some of these important future research areas are outlined. The key challenges appear to be to harmonize detection methods as well as microplastics mitigation from wastewater and sewage sludge."}{"A review of bio-based materials for oil spill treatment ": "Being cost-effective, synthetic materials were initially used abundantly for the removal of oil. Gradually, however, awareness of the use of dispersants like Corexit, which makes water resources more toxic than oil, has changed the scenario for the treatment of spilled oil. The removal of spilled oil from water resources is still a very topical issue. An eco-friendly and sustainable approach towards the environment has introduced many low-cost, non-toxic and biodegradable materials along with different biomasses to make micro-to nano-sized materials, membranes, sponges/aerogel, etc. for the removal and recovery of oil from water resources. Additionally, the reusability of these materials after the recovery of oils has added one more step towards sustainability. This review comprises the work conducted by various researchers in the field of the removal and recovery of spilled oils using various biomasses and polymers, either in the form of sorbents or separators."}{"Occurrence, identification and removal of microplastic particles and fibers in conventional activated sludge process and advanced MBR technology ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are acting as routes of microplastics (MPs) to the environment, hence the urgent need to examine MPs in wastewaters and different types of sludge through sampling campaigns covering extended periods of time. In this study, the efficiency of a municipal WWTP to remove MPs from wastewater was studied by collecting wastewater and sludge samples once in every two weeks during a 3-month sampling campaign. The WWTP was operated based on the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The microplastic particles and fibers from both water and sludge samples were identified by using an optical microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscope and Raman microscope. Overall, the retention capacity of microplastics in the studied WWTP was found to be 98.3%. Most of the MP fraction was removed before the activated sludge process. The efficiency of an advanced membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology was also examined. The main related finding is that MBR permeate contained 0.4\u202fMP/L in comparison with the final effluent of the CAS process (1.0\u202fMP/L). According to this study, both microplastic fibers and particles are discharged from the WWTP to the aquatic environment."}{"Evaluation of advanced oxidation processes for water and wastewater treatment \u2013 A critical review ": "This study provides an overview of established processes as well as recent progress in emerging technologies for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In addition to a discussion of major reaction mechanisms and formation of by-products, data on energy efficiency were collected in an extensive analysis of studies reported in the peer-reviewed literature enabling a critical comparison of various established and emerging AOPs based on electrical energy per order (EEO) values. Despite strong variations within reviewed EEO values, significant differences could be observed between three groups of AOPs: (1) O3 (often considered as AOP-like process), O3/H2O2, O3/UV, UV/H2O2, UV/persulfate, UV/chlorine, and electron beam represent median EEO values of <1\u202fkWh/m3, while median energy consumption by (2) photo-Fenton, plasma, and electrolytic AOPs were significantly higher (EEO values in the range of 1\u2013100 kWh/m3). (3) UV-based photocatalysis, ultrasound, and microwave-based AOPs are characterized by median values of >100\u202fkWh/m3 and were therefore considered as not (yet) energy efficient AOPs. Specific evaluation of 147 data points for the UV/H2O2 process revealed strong effects of operational conditions on reported EEO values. Besides water type and quality, a major influence was observed for process capacity (lab-vs. pilot-vs. full-scale applications) and, in case of UV-based processes, of the lamp type. However, due to the contribution of other factors, correlation of EEO values with specific water quality parameters such as UV absorbance and dissolved organic carbon were not substantial. Also, correlations between EEO and compound reactivity with OH-radicals were not significant (photolytically active compounds were not considered). Based on these findings, recommendations regarding the use of the EEO concept, including the upscaling of laboratory results, were derived."}{"Drought response in field grown potatoes and the interactions between canopy growth and yield ": "Potato is an important food crop with high yields. However when exposed to drought it suffers major yield losses. Considering its global importance and the increasing incidence of drought due to climate change, research toward drought tolerance in potato remains imperative. We have studied a set of 103 commercial cultivars representing the genetic diversity in the European potato market. The cultivars were grown in different field locations in three subsequent years (2013\u20132015). Our aim was to understand how different field drought regimes affect canopy growth in potato, and how these effects translate to tuber yield. The field environmental conditions were monitored, and pictures of canopy ground cover during the growing season were taken. Canopy growth parameters were extracted by an iterative method using the beta sigmoid growth function to model canopy growth. At harvest, tuber yield was scored and tuber size was graded. The GGE (Genotype and Genotype-by-Environment) bi-plot and Finlay Wilkinson\u2019s Regression were used to investigate Genotype x Environment interactions. We observed that the timing of the drought occurrence differentially affected canopy growth and tuber yield. Under drought stress, fast attainment of exponential growth and maximum canopy cover had negative effects on tuber formation and tuber bulking. Growth rate, maximum canopy cover, and area under the canopy curve (photosynthetic capacity over the growth season) were more important for tuber bulking than they were for tuber formation under drought stress. Cultivars with high yield were identified as potential material for improvement to drought tolerance. These findings will contribute to the breeding for drought-tolerant potato amidst the threats of climate change."}{"Impacts of plastic film mulching on crop yields, soil water, nitrate, and organic carbon in Northwestern China: A meta-analysis ": "In order to increase crop yield in semi-arid and arid areas, plastic film mulching (PFM) is widely used in Northwestern China. To date, many studies have addressed the effects of PFM on soil physical and biochemical properties in rain-fed agriculture in Northwestern China, but the findings of different studies are often contradictory. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the impacts of PFM on soil water content, soil nutrients and food production is needed. We compiled the results of 1278 observations to evaluate the overall effects of PFM on soil water content, the distribution of nitrate and soil organic carbon, and crop yield in rain-fed agriculture in Northwestern China. Our results showed that PFM increased soil moisture and nitrate concentration in topsoils (0\u201320\u202fcm) by 12.9% and 28.2%, respectively, but slightly decreased (1.8%) soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the 0\u201310\u202fcm soil layer. PFM significantly increased grain yields by 43.1%, with greatest effect in spring maize (79.4%). When related to cumulative precipitation during the crop growing season, yield increase from PFM was greatest (72.8%) at 200\u2013300\u202fmm, which was attributed to the large increase for spring maize and potato, implying that crop zoning would be beneficial for PFM in this region. When related to N application rate, crop yields benefited most from PFM (80.2%) at 200\u2013300\u202fkg/ha. A cost-benefit analysis indicated that PFM increased economic return by an average of 29.5%, with the best improvement for spring maize (71.1%) and no increase for spring wheat. In conclusion, PFM can significantly increase crop yield and economic return (especially for spring maize) in rain-fed agriculture areas of Northwestern China. Crop zoning is recommended for PFM to achieve the largest economic benefit. However, full account needs to be taken of the environmental impacts relating to N loss, SOC depletion and film pollution to evaluate the sustainability of PFM systems and further research is required to quantify and mitigate these impacts."}{"The dynamics of the relationship between household decision-making and farm household income in small-scale irrigation schemes in southern Africa ": "Irrigation has been promoted as a strategy to reduce poverty and improve livelihoods in southern Africa. Households\u2019 livelihood strategies within small-scale irrigation schemes have become increasingly complex and diversified. Strategies consist of farm income from rain-fed and irrigated cropping as well as livestock and an increasing dependence on off-farm income. The success of these strategies depends on the household\u2019s ability to make decisions about how to utilize its\u2019 financial, labour, land and water resources. This study explores the dynamics of decision-making in households on-farm household income within six small-scale irrigation schemes, across three southern African countries. Household survey data (n\u2009=\u2009402) was analyzed using ordered probit and ordinary least squares regression. Focus group discussions and field observations provided qualitative data on decision-making in the six schemes. We found strong support for the notion that decision-making dynamics strongly influence total household income. Households make trade-offs between irrigation, dryland, livestock and off-farm work when they allocate their labour resources to maximize household income; as opposed to maximizing the income from any individual component of their livelihood strategy, such as irrigation. Combined with the impact of the small plot size of irrigated land, this is likely to result in sub-optimal benefits from expensive investments in irrigation infrastructure. Policy-makers must consider this when developing and implementing new policies."}{"Urban agriculture and small farm water use: Case studies and trends from Cache Valley, Utah ": "The landscape of water in Utah is changing due to population growth, conversion of agricultural land to urban development, and increasing awareness of water scarcity. At the same time, Utah is experiencing a growing number of urban and small farms, but knowledge of water use in this sector is limited. Better understanding of what occurs at the field level on urban and small farms can aid state water use estimates and conservation efforts, and assist farmers in moving towards wiser water management. For the 2015 growing season, we performed irrigation evaluations for 24 urban and small farms in Cache Valley, Utah and we explore the results through case studies and identify trends among gross irrigation depth and field variables including field size, irrigation method, application uniformity, and scheduling practices. Results show a great degree of heterogeneity in irrigation methods, equipment used, and management practices. The beneficial consumed fraction of irrigation water ranged from 0.06 to 1.0. Small fields had lower application uniformities and greater irrigation depths than large fields. Surface irrigated fields had higher irrigation depths than sprinkle and drip irrigated fields. Additionally, fields using a fixed irrigation schedule had higher depths than fields that were irrigated inconsistently due to other factors. The results show that urban and small farm irrigators need improved knowledge of proper irrigation management. Irrigators, university extension services, and state water authorities working in this sector need to recognize the link between proper management and total water use, and focus more efforts on improving management, specifically how to use 1) low-cost methods to measure flow rates, 2) simple irrigation scheduling tools, and 3) improve application uniformity."}{"Analysis of the current world biofuel production under a water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus perspective ": "This paper assesses the sustainability of bioenergy production under a nexus perspective through a new efficiency type index. The index describes 1st generation biofuel production under the perspective of the implied consumption of natural resources. We consider the sustainability of energy production as a sequence of steps, each characterised by its efficiency, and propose an index which returns an overall efficiency value describing the adequacy or inadequacy of the considered processes under a nexus perspective. The direct application of the nexus index entails an indication of the possible improvements needed to move production towards most sustainable processes or places. Moreover, it allows evaluating the efficiency of the main crops currently used in biofuel production with respect to the water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus. The results depict countries presently capable of performing sustainable production of 1st generation biofuel from particular crops. Furthermore, the analysis of the single components of the nexus index allows understanding the effects of possible improvements (e.g. soil and water management, new generation biofuels) on the overall production efficiency under a nexus perspective."}{"\n               In situ characterization of immiscible three-phase flow at the pore scale for a water-wet carbonate rock ": "X-ray micro-tomography is used to image the pore-scale configurations of fluid in a rock saturated with three phases - brine, oil and gas - mimicking a subsurface reservoir, at high pressure and temperature. We determine pore occupancy during a displacement sequence that involves waterflooding, gas injection and water re-injection. In the water-wet sample considered, brine occupied the smallest pores, gas the biggest, while oil occupied pores of intermediate size and is displaced by both water and gas. Double displacement events have been observed, where gas displaces oil that displaces water or vice versa. The thickness of water and oil layers have been quantified, as have the contact angles between gas and oil, and oil and water. These results are used to explain the nature of trapping in three-phase flow, specifically how oil preferentially traps gas in the presence of water."}{"Assessment of groundwater quality and remediation in karst aquifers: A review ": "Karst aquifers, capable of storing and transmitting large amount of water, are the main source of drinking water in many regions worldwide. Their excessive permeability leads to an enhanced vulnerability to retain and spread the contamination accordingly. From sustainability perspective, the environmental, economic and social impacts of karst contamination on water resources management are gaining more attention. In this study, an overview of hydrogeological processes and concepts regarding groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karstic systems is presented, followed by a short discussion on surface water and groundwater interaction. Due to the complexity of karstic systems, different approaches have been developed by researchers for investigating and understanding hydrogeological processes and groundwater behavior in karst which are reviewed herein. Additionally, groundwater contamination issues and the most common and effective remediation techniques in karstic terrains are discussed. Lastly, modeling techniques and remote sensing methods, as beneficial and powerful tools for assessing groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karst terrains, are reviewed and evaluated. In each section, relevant research works conducted for Puerto Rico are discussed and some recommendations are presented to complement the ongoing hydrogeological investigations on this island."}{"Geospatial and multivariate analysis of trace metals in tubewell water using for drinking purpose in the upper Gangetic basin, India: Heavy metal pollution index ": "Groundwater samples via tubewells were collected from the district Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh (India). The study aimed to analyse groundwater quality and potential sources of trace metal contamination using the multivariate statistical tool, and the level of contamination by applying contamination index (Cd) and heavy metal pollution index (HPI). The groundwater was found to be enriched with Fe and contaminated with the trace and toxic elements like Al, As, B, Cu, Mn and Pb having mean values of 2786, 152, 9, 1033, 107, 199 and 15\u202f\u00b5L respectively. Arsenic exceeded the\u00a0WHO (2011) guidelines and BIS (2012) standard (10\u202f\u00b5g/L) for 30% of the groundwater samples. For B, 46% of the samples were found having concentration higher than BIS (2012) permissible limit (1000\u202f\u00b5g/L) and 3% to WHO (2011) guideline values (2400\u202f\u00b5L). Lead level exceeded the BIS (2012) standard value and WHO (2011) guideline value in 46% of the samples. Multivariate analysis identified three factors responsible for data composition explaining 81% of the total variance in groundwater samples. Factor analysis (PCA and CA) allowed grouping of parameters according to the common features; Fe, Mn and Pb were associated with PC1 and controlled by the mixed origin such as geogenic sources as well as anthropogenic activities. Boron and Cu (PC2) were controlled by anthropogenic activities while As (PC3) was derived from the geogenic sources. The northern part of study area has higher Pb and Mn concentration than the southern part associated with small industrial activities. Degree of contamination and heavy metal pollution index supported the results and higher contamination was found to be in the vicinity of industrial setups. The overall quality (estimated using HPI values) of groundwater in the northern area is poor, and may cause potential health risk from the analyzed tubewells to the local population if the water is consumed for longer time."}{"Hydrogeochemical investigation of groundwater in Dhaka City of Bangladesh using GIS and multivariate statistical techniques ": "GIS and multivariate statistics along with the geochemical approaches were applied in this study to investigate the hydrogeochemical behavior, source apportionment of groundwater pollutants and their spatial distribution in the aquifer system of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. A total of 33 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed, in order to evaluate the geochemical constituents of groundwater. Results found that, the trends of cations and anions are Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3\n                     \u2212 > Cl\u2212 > SO4\n                     2\u2212 > NO3\n                     \u2212 respectively, and Ca2+\u2013Mg2+\u2013HCO3\n                     \u2212 is the dominant groundwater type. Except Na+, K+, Cl\u2212, F\u2212 and NO3\n                     \u2212 all others measured parameters fall within the permissible limits. However, silicate weathering was identified as the major processes of controlling the groundwater solute content. Besides, cation exchange plays a significant role, influencing the water chemistry of the aquifers. Aqueous speciation model revealed that, aquifer materials were more saturated with aragonite, calcite and dolomite, and under-saturated with halite. From regression and correlation analysis it was found that, EC, Cl\u2212 and SO4\n                     2\u2212 were correlated with each other's; which might helpful for site specific monitoring of groundwater quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were also employed to appraise the sources of contaminants, and it was explored that both natural and anthropogenic factors were influencing the groundwater quality. Groundwater was contaminated due to induced river recharge and rapid infiltration of contaminated water through the recharge areas. In this situation it is expected that, outcomes of this study will provide useful insights to planners for sustainable management of groundwater resources of this megacity."}{"Assessment of geothermal water quality for industrial and irrigation purposes in the Unai geothermal field, Gujarat, India ": "Nowadays, a spotlight on the direct manipulation of water from the geothermal fields is laid for manifold applications. This manuscript discusses the utilization of water produced from geothermal wells for irrigation and industrial purposes. In order to identify the suitability of the water for the above mentioned uses, various hydrochemical parameters were evaluated. Samples were collected from three geothermal well sites from Unai village, a prominent geothermal field situated in Navsari district, Gujarat, India. The hydrochemistry of the samples collected from hot spring (depth 30\u201345\u202fm) was studied and samples were examined by calculating different parameters. The complete study was done individually for both industrial and irrigational uses of geothermal water. The mean surface temperature of the water is 55\u202f\u00b0C and average pH of the sample studied is 8.12. The key Water Quality Indices (WQI) such as Langelier Saturation Index (LSI), Ryznar Stability Index (RSI), Puckorius Scaling Index (PSI) and Larson-Skold Index (LS) were examined for industrial utilization and the key indices like Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR), Sodium Percentage (SP), Kelly Ratio (KR) Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) and Permeability Index (PI) were examined for irrigational utilization of geothermal water. LSI and RSI values show that carbonate and bicarbonate concentration is in the desirable range, however, LS (15.09, 13.54) is very high which indicates higher Cl- content. High value of indices such as SAR, KR, and SP points out the increased concentration of Na+ in the water sample. The results of this study would help the end users to identify the necessary water-treatments before utilizing the water for industrial and irrigation purposes in the study area."}{"Environmental risk assessment of coal fly ash on soil and groundwater quality, Aligarh, India ": "An open and indiscriminate disposal of coal fly ash causes extensive changes in physicochemical properties of soil and water. Few studies propose that coal fly ash is a potential soil ameliorant that may improve the physical, chemical, biological properties, and nutritional quality of the agricultural soil. However, several recent studies documented that incorporation of higher dosages of coal fly ash into water and soil releases toxic elements consequently creating soil and groundwater pollution leading to major health, environmental, and land use problems. To assess the environmental impact of hazardous coal fly ash on the ecological system, physicochemical and hydrogeochemical analysis of both soil and groundwater are performed. X-ray diffractograms (XRD) of soils from agricultural and landfill sites (n = 8) along with coal fly ash (n = 2) show the presence of characteristic minerals of coal fly ash and also toxic arsenic mineral phases suggesting the strong influence of hazardous coal fly ash on agricultural soil. The hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater samples (n = 27) are analyzed which show elevated concentrations of most of the major ions corresponding to higher values than maximum permissible levels of recommended drinking water standards by World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The water quality indices (WQI) suggests poor to unsuitable water for drinking. Conversely, evaluation of various other hydrochemical indices calculated using elemental concentration of the groundwater samples demarcates contamination of water due to the open dumping of coal fly ash and therefore not desirable for drinking purposes."}{"Synthesis of bone char from cattle bones and its application for fluoride removal from the contaminated water ": "This study is focused on the synthesis of bone char (BC) and its application in adsorptive removal of fluoride from the water. The BC was synthesized by the thermal pyrolysis of used cattle bones. In preliminary stage, BC was synthesized at different temperatures ranging from 350 to 700\u202f\u00b0C and due to the higher surface area and adsorption capacity, BC synthesized at 350\u202f\u00b0C was selected for further experiments. The XRD pattern of BC found better in agreement with the standard pattern of hydroxyapatite. FTIR analysis also signified basic spectra of hydroxyapatite with specific bands at wavelength of 3429, 1639, 1453, 1037, 604 and 566\u202fcm\u22121. Typical agglomerated structure of hydroxyapatite was witnessed in morphological examination with SEM. The specific surface area, total pore volume and the average pore diameter were found 79.34\u202fm2 g\u22121, 0.041\u202fcm3 g\u22121 and 2.09\u202fnm, respectively. The elemental chemical analysis revealed 1.71 Ca/P ratio. About 10.56\u202fmg of fluoride was adsorbed on 1\u202fg of BC. The adsorption isotherm data was briefly illustrated by applying Langmuir isotherm model and Freundlich isotherm model. In conclusion, BC is successfully synthesized and the highest fluoride adsorption capacity was achieved as compared with earlier studies."}{"Groundwater governance in Bangladesh: Established practices and recent trends ": "Legal framework is very crucial to protect the vital resources, to provide rights to public and administration, to support national policy and to bring technological intervention to ensure equitable distribution, fair management, and effective decision making. In Bangladesh, groundwater is not directly priced (other than pumping costs), perhaps such issue is not surprising that users do not meter the volumes of water usage. Beside the industry, agricultural sector is by far the biggest groundwater consumer of this country, contributing significant amount of annual meter drop in the groundwater table to the annual decline of groundwater table. Additionally, the groundwater resources are severely affected by, pollution, encroachment and overexploitation. National Water Policy (1999) and Bangladesh Water Act (2013) are considered as country's pivotal legal framework but both of these lag behind to provide effective guidelines on permission, extraction limit, monitoring, protection of quality, water harvesting procedure, and recharge mechanism. Existing institutions suffer from consistent crisis, politics, corruption, absence of public participation and coordination of other institutions, mismanagement, and empirical assessment. This study evaluates the existing water related policies and functions of multidimensional institutions, and discusses the key challenges of effective groundwater management. The present paper also provides an overview of established practices around the world to cope with the common challenges."}{"Groundwater potentiality study in drought prone barind tract, NW Bangladesh using remote sensing and GIS ": "Present study is carried out in the drought prone Barind tract in the north-western part of Bangladesh to identify zones of groundwater potentiality using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) based geospatial multi-criteria approach. Decreasing rainfall trend along with increasing demand for groundwater irrigation of this agro-based area utters urgent need for sustainable groundwater resource development. The study area possesses sub-dendritic drainage pattern with highly irregular to irregular geomorphological character with mostly flat to gentle slope represents 'not so good category' for groundwater development because of lower rainfall with less favorable infiltration capacity of top soil with respect to time of percolation of runoff. Here major portion of runoff water loses and not allows more infiltration to recharge the groundwater and, therefore is less potential for groundwater occurrence and development. To delineate groundwater potentiality, thematic layers like geomorphology, drainage density, rainfall, lithology, lineament density, slope and land use/land cover (LULC) have taken into consideration to integrate in the GIS environment, and has categorized as: 4% (48\u202fkm2) - very good, 13% (170\u202fkm2) - good; 25% (342\u202fkm2) - moderate; 30% (405\u202fkm2) - poor; and 28% (365\u202fkm2) as very poor category. On the other hand, this potential zonation is most sensitive to lithology; followed by slope and lineament density; and succeeded by geomorphology, drainage density, rainfall, and LULC. This study helps not only to classify zones of groundwater resource potentiality, but also to assess groundwater resource potentiality and scopes for its future development at a glance and provides a guideline for the groundwater resource management approach particularly in the area."}{"Comprehensive investigation of groundwater quality in the north-west of Iran: Physicochemical and heavy metal analysis ": "The suitability of rural groundwater quality for drinking purposes were investigated in the north west of Iran. Major anions, cations and heavy metals were measured in 39 water wells during the summer and spring seasons. The spatial distribution of major parameters and hydro-chemical faces were described by developing GIS-based maps and Piper and Gibbs diagrams. According to the results, the EC values were in the range of 461 and 2600\u202f\u03bcs/cm with the hardness contents between 220 and 720\u202fmg/L as CaCO3. It was found that, the total hardness is highly correlated with the magnesium concentration than calcium in all samples. The dominant cations and anions were in the order of Mg2+ > Na+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3\n                     - > SO4\n                     2- > Cl- > NO3\n                     - > F-, respectively. The major water types in the area were fresh (Ca-HCO3) and saline (Ca-Mg-Cl). Based on Gibbs plot, the main mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry were rainfall dominance, rock weathering dominance, and evaporation-participation dominance. The lower quality of water resources sited in the southern and northern parts of the area was observed according to the GIS maps. It was found that aluminum, boron, iron and manganese concentrations, in some cases, were higher than the guideline values however, it can be concluded that groundwater quality in the study area, apart from some cases, is suitable for drinking purposes without any specific treatment processes. The present study gives a comprehensive status of groundwater quality for proper management in the area."}{"Potential for aquifer contamination of anthropogenic activity in the recharge area of the Guarani Aquifer System, southeast of Brazil ": "Understanding the response of physical environment to anthropogenic activities assists land use planning aimed at protecting water resources, which prevents society from incurring major economic and social costs. This paper aimed to identify the potential contamination of groundwater by human activity at an outcropping area of Guarani Aquifer System (GAS), the most important hydrogeological unit in South America. The methodology used was based on a multi-criteria analysis using decision matrices to analyze, from algebra mapping in a GIS environment, the influence of rock units, aquifer units, soil classes, steepness, slope shape, and land cover and use in contamination potential. Overall, medium to very high potential for groundwater contamination predominates in the area, amounting to 69.23%. In such areas, when the absence of federal or state law which defines the areas of protection for recharge, the master plans of the municipalities located in the GAS outcropping regions play an important role in complementing the legislation. S\u00e3o Carlos, has its own legislation that aims to control land use in areas of springs, and thereby to protect them. However, the GAS recharge areas near the surface are not contemplated, and specific regulation and standards for deployment of human activity in these areas, have not been established. Therefore, it is suggested that territorial planning to be carried out on a more refined scale. Given that the natural conditions and anthropogenic activities performed in the area of study are reflected in many other periurban wellheads, as well as that of the Guarani Aquifer outcropping are, the decision matrices designed can be applied and serve as an agile tool to define the recharge areas to be protected on a preliminary basis."}{"Groundwater quality and vulnerability assessment in west Luxor Governorate, Egypt ": "Groundwater is the main source of water for different purposes in the desert areas of Egypt. The agricultural and different human activities in line with hydrological characteristics have influenced the quality of this water resource. The main aim of this work was the determination of groundwater quality and vulnerability to pollution in west Luxor Governorate, Egypt. For completion of this work, 50 boreholes were sampled during October 2014 and groundwater samples were analyzed chemically. Hydrological, topographic, lithological, climatic conditions and land use data, which considered key factors for pollutants transport, were also collected for building groundwater vulnerability maps. The results revealed high levels of groundwater pollution with NO3\u00af, Cd and Pb, as well as increased levels of total dissolved solids. The map of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability (based on the IV index; Arauzo 2017) showed medium and high levels of vulnerability associated with natural factors in 62% and 38% of the area, respectively. The map of specific groundwater vulnerability (based on the LU-IV procedure; Arauzo 2017) indicated that 52% of the area showed high to extreme levels of vulnerability to nitrate pollution from nonpoint sources. From this, it was concluded that the study area can be considered as Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) and, therefore, specific measures (including optimization of water and N-fertilizers applications) must be taken in order to restore water quality."}{"Water as key to the sustainable development goals of South Sudan \u2013 A water quality assessment of Eastern Equatoria State ": "South Sudan, the world's newest nation is bestowed with huge fresh water resources. However, water resources management in South Sudan is lacking in water quality monitoring data and comprehensive plans of action for sustainable water resources development.\n                  Groundwater resources in particular have been exploited for domestic and irrigation use versus surface water. However, this groundwater withdrawal has not been monitored for its level and quality. To overcome this deficit, groundwater major ion chemistry in the South Sudan's Eastern Equatoria State was evaluated to determine its suitability for drinking, domestic, and irrigation purposes. A total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during wet (October 2014) and dry (April 2014) seasons. Sampling points were spread around the eight counties of Eastern Equatoria. Twenty two water samples were collected from each county. The samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters including alkalinity, calcium hardness, conductivity, pH, salinity, TDS, total hardness, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, CrT, Cd2+, Cu2+, FeT, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, NO3\n                     -, Cl-, F-, SO4\n                     2-, PO4\n                     3-, and SiO2. Groundwater irrigation quality indices including chlorinity index, Kelli Index, magnesium ratio, percentage of sodium must be replaced by sodium percentage (%Na), permeability index (PI), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), salinity index, sodicity index, and sodium absorption ratio (SAR), were calculated to determine the groundwater suitability for agricultural uses. The results were compared with South Sudan water quality guidelines (SSWQGs) and the WHO standards. Most of the water quality parameters met the WHO standards and SSWQGs prescribed for drinking and domestic purposes. The calculated irrigation water quality indices indicated the water suitability for irrigation."}{"Common effluent treatment plant (CETP): Reliability analysis and performance evaluation ": "Common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) have been installed and are in operation at numerous industrial clusters throughout India. They serve to reduce effluent treatment cost, provide better collective treatment, and reduce land cost for small-scale industrial facilities that cannot afford individual treatment plants. Optimum working conditions for treatment of effluent to be at par with discharge standards is a major mandate for any CETP. In this study, the reliability and removal efficiencies (REs) of a CETP in the industrial area of Maharashtra State in India were examined. An established methodology was adopted to determine the effectiveness of the CETP in terms of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease (O&G) concentrations. The CETP's compliance with respect to design standards and its operation were studied in detail. This paper highlights the results of RE and the coefficient of determination (R\n                     2) values obtained from the CETP data, estimates the pollutants removed at the highest and lowest rates over a period of time, and highlights the reasons for problem areas along with remedial measures. It was observed that, except O&G, all the parameters (BOD, COD, and TSS) showed fluctuations in removal efficiencies and their reliabilities. This situation can be improved by releasing effluent containing hydraulic and organic loading to the CETP as per standards and optimizing treatment processes, especially primary clari-flocculators and aeration tanks, both of which are important units of any CETP."}{"Experimental and numerical analysis of flow over a rectangular full-width sharp-crested weir ": "Weirs are a type of hydraulic structure, used for water level adjustment, flow measurement, and diversion of water in irrigation systems. In this study, experiments were conducted on sharp-crested weirs under free-flow conditions and an optimization method was used to determine the best form of the discharge coefficient equation based on the coefficient of determination (R\n                     2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The ability of the numerical method to simulate the flow over the weir was also investigated using Fluent software. Results showed that, with an increase of the ratio of the head over the weir crest to the weir height (h/P), the discharge coefficient decreased nonlinearly and reached a constant value of 0.7 for h/P\u00a0>\u00a00.6. The best form of the discharge coefficient equation predicted the discharge coefficient well and percent errors were within a \u00b15% error limit. Numerical results of the discharge coefficient showed strong agreement with the experimental data. Variation of the discharge coefficient with Reynolds numbers showed that the discharge coefficient reached a constant value of 0.7 when h/P\u00a0>\u00a00.6 and Re\u00a0>\u00a020000."}{"Understanding groundwater table using a statistical model ": "In this study, a statistical model was established to estimate the groundwater table using precipitation, evaporation, the river stage of the Liangduo River, and the tide level of the Yellow Sea, as well as to predict the groundwater table with easily measurable climate data in a coastal plain in eastern China. To achieve these objectives, groundwater table data from twelve wells in a farmland covering an area of 50\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0m were measured over a 12-month period in 2013 in Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province. Trend analysis and correlation analysis were conducted to study the patterns of changes in the groundwater table. In addition, a linear regression model was established and regression analysis was conducted to understand the relationships between precipitation, evaporation, river stage, tide level, and groundwater table. The results are as follows: (1) The groundwater table was strongly affected by climate factors (e.g., precipitation and evaporation), and river stage was also a significant factor affecting the groundwater table in the study area (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, where p is the probability value). (2) The groundwater table was especially sensitive to precipitation. The significance of the factors of the groundwater table were ranked in the following descending order: precipitation, evaporation, and river stage. (3) A triple linear regression model of the groundwater table, precipitation, evaporation, and river stage was established. The linear relationship between the groundwater table and the main factors was satisfied by the actual values versus the simulated values of the groundwater table (R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.841, where R\n                     2 is the coefficient of determination)."}{"Modeling river water quality parameters using modified adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system ": "Water quality is always one of the most important factors in human health. Artificial intelligence models are respected methods for modeling water quality. The evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a new technique for improving the performance of artificial intelligence models such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Attempts have been made to make the models more suitable and accurate with the replacement of other training methods that do not suffer from some shortcomings, including a tendency to being trapped in local optima or voluminous computations. This study investigated the applicability of ANFIS with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization for continuous domains (ACOR) in estimating water quality parameters at three stations along the Zayandehrood River, in Iran. The ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-ACOR methods were also compared with the classic ANFIS method, which uses least squares and gradient descent as training algorithms. The estimated water quality parameters in this study were electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), carbonate hardness (CH), and total hardness (TH). Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS software to determine the optimal inputs to the models. The analysis showed that ANFIS-PSO was the better model compared with ANFIS-ACOR. It is noteworthy that EA models can improve ANFIS' performance at all three stations for different water quality parameters."}{"Impact of climate change on hydropower generation in Rio Jubones Basin,\u00a0Ecuador ": "This study attempted to use the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), integrated with geographic information systems (GIS), for assessment of climate change impacts on hydropower generation. This methodology of climate change impact modeling was developed and demonstrated through application to a hydropower plant in the Rio Jubones Basin in Ecuador. ArcSWAT 2012 was used to develop a model for simulating the river flow. The model parameters were calibrated and validated on a monthly scale with respect to the hydro-meteorological inputs observed from 1985 to 1991 and from 1992 to 1998, respectively. Statistical analyses produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSEs) of 0.66 and 0.61 for model calibration and validation, respectively, which were considered acceptable. Numerical simulation with the model indicated that climate change could alter the seasonal flow regime of the basin, and the hydropower potential could change due to the changing climate in the future. Scenario analysis indicates that, though the hydropower generation will increase in the wet season, the plant will face a significant power shortage during the dry season, up to 13.14% from the reference scenario, as a consequence of a 17% reduction of streamflow under an assumption of a 2.9\u00b0C increase in temperature and a 15% decrease in rainfall. Overall, this study showed that hydrological processes are realistically modeled with SWAT and the model can be a useful tool for predicting the impact of climate change."}{"A comparative study of pseudo-static slope stability analysis using different design codes ": "Many researchers have developed new calculation methods to analyze seismic slope stability problems, but the conventional pseudo-static method is still widely used in engineering design due to its simplicity. Based on the Technical Code for Building Slope Engineering (GB\u00a050330\u20142013) of China and the Guidelines for Evaluating and Mitigating Seismic Hazards in California (SP117), a comparative study on the pseudo-static method was performed. The results indicate that the largest difference between these two design codes lies in determination of the seismic equivalence reduction factor (f\n                     eq). The GB 50330\u20142013 code specifies a single value for f\n                     eq of 0.25. In SP117, numerous factors, such as magnitude and distance, are considered in determining f\n                     eq. Two case studies show that the types of slope stability status evaluated by SP117 are in agreement with those evaluated by the seismic time-history stability analysis and Newmark displacement analysis. The factors of safety evaluated by SP117 can be used in practice for safe design. However, the factors of safety evaluated by GB 50330\u20142013 are risky for slope seismic design."}{"Performance investigation of atmospheric water harvesting systems ": "In this paper performance and limitations of commercially-available atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) systems are experimentally investigated. A new experimental setup and test procedure, following the relevant ASHRAE and ANSI/AHRI standards, are developed to measure the water harvesting rate and input electrical power of several residential-size AWHs from different manufacturers. The setup is equipped with an environmental chamber to mimic all climatic conditions in research laboratory at Simon Fraser University and to obtain performance characteristics of AWH systems. The results show the range of water harvesting rate, energy intensity ranging from 1.02\u202fkWh/L for warm and humid to 6.23\u202fkWh/L for cold and humid climates, and climatic limitations of the conventional AWH technology that can be used as a platform for further development of higher efficiency AWH systems in future."}{"Sustainable water management and improved corporate reporting in mining ": "The advent of corporate sustainability reporting and water accounting standards has resulted in increased disclosure of water use by mining companies. However, there has been limited compilation and analysis of these disclosures. To address this, we compiled a database of 8314 data points from 359 mining company reports, classified according to mining industry water accounting guidelines. The quality of disclosures is shown to have improved considerably over time. Although, opportunities still exist to improve reporting practices, such as by ensuring that all relevant water flows are reported and to explicitly state non-existent flows (e.g. discharges). Initial data analysis reveals considerable variability in water withdrawals, use efficiency and discharges between mining operations. Further work to improve industry coverage and to analyse the influence of mine specific factors such as ore processing methods and local climate will provide insights into the interactions of mining and water resources at a global scale."}{"Development of iron oxide/activated carbon nanoparticle composite for the removal of Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions from aqueous solution ": "Iron oxide (Fe3O4) and iron oxide/activated carbon (Fe3O4/AC) were fabricated by co-precipitation method for the removal of Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions from aqueous solution in batch mode. These nanoparticles were characterized by BET, FTIR, XRD, SEM/TEM and VSM. The optimum conditions for the removal of ions were pH\u202f=\u202f2 for Cr(VI) and 6 for Cu(II) and Cd(II),\u00a0initial metal ion concentration\u202f=\u202f50\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121,\u00a0nanoparticle dose\u202f=\u202f50\u202fmg/10\u202fmL, temperature\u202f=\u202f25\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C, shaking speed\u202f=\u202f180\u202frpm and contact time\u202f=\u202f3\u202fh. The equilibrium data of ions sorption were well described by Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Intraparticle Diffusion model. The R2 values obtained by Langmuir model were highest by Fe3O4/AC for Cr(VI)\u202f=\u202f0.9994,Cu(II)\u202f=\u202f0.9998 and Cd(II)=\u202f0.9750. The temperature dependent study in the range of 288\u2013328\u202fK confirmed that the adsorption process was endothermic in nature. Desorption studies with 0.1\u202fM HCl stated that these nanoparticles can be regenerated effectively and can be used after four adsorption-desorption cycles without any mass loss."}{"Do farmers value rice varieties tolerant to droughts and floods? Evidence from a discrete choice experiment in Odisha, India ": "Abiotic stresses such as droughts and floods significantly constrain rice production in India. New stress tolerant technologies have the potential to reduce yield variability and help insulate farmers from the risks posed by these hazards. Using discrete choice experiments conducted in rural Odisha, we estimate farmers' valuation for drought-tolerant (DT) and submergence-tolerant (SubT) traits embodied in rice cultivars. Our results demonstrate that farmers in both drought-prone as well as submergence prone regions value reduction in yield variability offered by new, stress-tolerant cultivars, and would generally be willing to pay a significant premium for these traits. While virtually all farmers perceive the threat of drought and are willing to pay for protection against drought risk, only farmers in flood-prone areas would be willing to pay for rice that can withstand being submerged for prolonged periods, suggesting the potential for market segmentation along geographical or ecological lines."}{"Determining payments for watershed services by hydro-economic modeling for optimal water allocation between agricultural and municipal water use ": ""}{"Exploring the potential of local market in remunerating water ecosystem services in Cambodia: An application for endogenous attribute non-attendance modelling ": "Within South East Asia, certification and local market development may play an important role in incentivizing farmers to continue with nature-based solutions delivered by organic or traditional farming practices and avoid using environmentally detrimental production techniques. The purpose of this study is to use economic valuation in order to achieve an empirical understanding of local consumer preferences for different attributes of rice products. Application of the agrarian system approach reveals that rice cultivation systems observed in the Tonle Sape Lake of the Mekong River Basin in Cambodia (our study case) may target three ecosystem services that present the characteristics of public goods and may benefit consumer support. A choice experiment survey was administered among local consumers in the city of Phnom Penh in 2013. Econometric analysis indicates high rate of non-attendance for the price attribute. It also suggests that 17% of the respondents made their choices neglecting attributes describing ecosystem services. However, there are evidence of consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for certified organic rice higher than the price-premium observed on the local market. Furthermore, there is additional WTP value for the preservation of ecosystem services. We discuss the implications of our findings on potential payment for ecosystem services in the specific case of rice."}{"Valuing water: Selected applications ": ""}{"Modeling dynamics and adaptation at operational and structural scales for the ex-ante economic evaluation of large dams in an African context ": "Dams can produce electricity and ensure water security, but at the same time they radically alter the hydrological regime of rivers with significant consequences for the economic and environmental welfare of the region in which they are located. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is currently the most frequently used framework for the economic evaluations of dams. Changes at different time scales influence the economic appraisal of dams. However, change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural level are often not included in the CBA evaluation. Not including change and adaptation limits the realistic estimation of cost and benefits, and the appreciation of resilient solutions that offer satisfactory responses for a large set of future scenarios.\n                  In this paper we consider the specific features of large dams in an African context, and identify methods for an economic evaluation that takes into account for change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural scales, as well as their interplay. These methods are then applied to the ex-ante evaluation of a system of existing dams on the Senegal River Valley. Results indicate the economic potential of the dams under changing conditions, for both adaptive and non-adaptive reservoir operation strategies."}{"Water quality decisions and policy for an interstate watershed ": "We develop and apply a dynamic game model with economic, hydrologic, environmental and institutional components for interdependent states to meet water quality goals either jointly or separately. States minimize costs of phosphorus pollution abatement subject to phosphorus dynamics to reach the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) water quality goal across agricultural, urban and stormwater sectors. Comparing noncooperation to cooperation helps delineate key differences in strategies to meet water quality goals. Monte Carlo simulations are used throughout the modeling process to incorporate natural variation in model parameter estimates. Nonlinear and asymmetric cost functions of pollution abatement for each state are estimated from data of each state's implementation of abatement across three sectors. The analysis helps assess how well states achieve the TMDL policy by a government-specified deadline of 2025. Variation in the abatement cost functions across states, sectors and abatement practices within each sector sets the stage to explore sharing of cost minimizing alternatives across all of these scales over time. The least cost option for each state takes into account asymmetry with cooperation across the interstate watershed to reduce total phosphorus load over the time horizon to meet the Clean Water Act goal by the 2025 deadline."}{"The economic impacts of water information systems: A systematic review ": "Information systems can yield economic value by providing data and analyses that are useful for improving water operations and planning. Working from a simple typology of water management domains that acknowledges the coupling of supply and demand, we characterize the nature of peer-reviewed and practitioner research that considers or makes reference to the costs and benefits of water-related information. The coverage of the reviewed studies is heterogeneous across domains, sectors, analytical methods, type of information considered, and geographic regions. Studies that discuss costs and benefits of additional information relative to a counterfactual represent a minority (39%) of those reviewed. Most of these counterfactual studies use a model prediction (60%) and/or extrapolate from previous studies (34%); far fewer rely on empirical evidence (24%). Furthermore, measurement of and justification for the proposed benefits and costs \u2013 whether monetized or only quantified \u2013 remains limited. We also comment on several of the more prominent methodologies for analyzing the costs and benefits of investments in improved water information. This leads to reflections on a research agenda that would enrich what is known about the economic value of water resources information, and thereby perhaps improve decision-makers\u2019 ability to make fruitful investments in information systems. In the absence of more rigorous evidence on the contribution that specific systems make to societal well-being, decision-makers will likely remain tentative about further information investments."}{"Socio-hydrological assessment of water security in canal irrigation systems: A conjoint quantitative analysis of equity and reliability ": "This paper offers a socio-hydrological assessment of water security that compares canal irrigation entitlements with water deliveries using a conjoint analysis of system reliability and equity. We develop a set of definitions and metrics to quantitatively characterize reliability and equity using newly available datasets of 10-daily canal deliveries from 2007\u20132017 in the Punjab canal command areas in the Indus Basin Irrigation System of Pakistan, where emphasis has shifted from distributing historically-defined volumetric supplies to improving irrigation efficiencies and crop yields in order to achieve greater aggregate water and food security. Our analysis reveals stagnation and oscillation over time in system-level equity and reliability. We reflect on the potential to positively affect canal irrigation performance and water security through a socio-hydrological approach."}{"Prevalence of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in a wastewater effluent-receiving river in the Netherlands ": "Antibiotics are being used intensively for humans and livestock worldwide and have led to the presence of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as a point source for ARB&Gs, and water catchments consequently are potential receptors of ARB&Gs. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of antibiotics (macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines), ARGs (ermB, sul1, sul2, tetW), and class 1 integron (targeting the integrase gene), in a Dutch river that receives wastewater treatment plant effluent. Sediment and water samples were collected during one year along the river. The WWTP significantly increased the amounts of antibiotics and ARGs in the river as compared to the upstream samples, of which the antibiotics decreased once they entered the river. ARGs were persistent in the water and sediment from the WWTP effluent discharge point until 20\u202fkm downstream. This study provides insight in the prevalence of antibiotics and ARGs in a wastewater effluent-receiving river system in the Netherlands. Even though human antibiotic usage is low in the Netherlands, antibiotics, residues of antibiotics, and ARGs are detected in the river surface water-sediment system, which shows that a river has the potential to act as a reservoir of ARGs."}{"Efficiency of various recent wastewater dye removal methods: A review ": "Dye effluents released from numerous dye-utilizing industries are harmful towards the environment and living things. Consequently, existence of dye effluent in environmental water bodies is becoming a growing concern to environmentalists and civilians. A long term sustainable and efficient dye effluent treatment method should be established to eliminate this issue. Dye wastewater should be treated first before release to minimize its negative impacts towards the environment and living things. However, due to lack of information on efficient dye removal methods, it is difficult to decide on a single technique that resolves the prevailing dye effluent issue. Therefore, this paper reviews existing research papers on various biological, chemical and physical dye removal methods to find its efficiency through percentage of dye removal. Although there are numerous existing tried and tested methods to accomplish dye removal, most of them have a common disadvantage which is the generation of secondary pollution to the environment. This paper highlights enzyme degradation (biological) and adsorption (physical) dye removal as these are known as one of the most efficient dye removal techniques these days. This paper also suggests the usage of a combined adsorbent as it is envisioned that this technique has better efficiency and is able to remove dyes at a faster rate."}{"Removal of cadmium from wastewaters with low-cost adsorbents ": "Instead of using commercial activated carbon or ion exchange resins, researchers have worked on inexpensive materials, such as wastes from industry and agricultural operations due to their outstanding adsorption behavior toward heavy metal ions. Low-cost adsorbents are easily and locally available in large quantities. The modification of these materials could considerably increase their sorption capacity. In this review, the technical feasibility of various low-cost adsorbents for removal of Cd(II) from wastewaters has been discussed. Due to widespread cadmium contamination and its toxicity, there is considerable interest to remove it before discharge into wastewater streams. Several factors affecting an adsorption process such as pH, contact time as well as the reported maximum adsorption capacity values are summarized. The subsequent regeneration and reuse of adsorbents has been given considerable attention and some adsorption studies using real wastewater samples were also discussed."}{"Trends in CO2 conversion and utilization: A review from process systems perspective ": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) community has been struggling over the past few decades to demonstrate the economic feasibility of CO2 sequestration. Nevertheless, in practice, it has only proven feasible under conditions with a market for the recovered CO2, such as in the beverage industry or enhanced oil/gas recovery. The research community and industry are progressively converging to a conclusion that CO2 sequestration has severe limitations for the value proposition. Alternatively, creating diverse demand markets and revenue streams for the recovered almost-pure CO2 may prevail over CO2 sequestration option and improve the economic feasibility of this climate change mitigation approach. As such, research in the carbon capture and management field is seen to be shifting towards CO2 utilization, directly and indirectly, in energy and chemical industries.\n                  In this paper, we have critically reviewed the literature on carbon capture, conversion, and utilization routes and assessed the progress in the research and developments in this direction. Both physical and chemical CO2 utilization pathways are studied and the principles of key routes are identified. The literature is also probed in addressing the process integration scenarios and the performance assessment benchmarks."}{"Fabrication of advance magnetic carbon nano-materials and their potential applications: A review ": "Novel magnetic carbon nano-materials have attracted great interest in recent years due to their potential applications in many areas that exploit the combined advantage of magnetic with nano-scale properties. These materials are suitable for the catalysis, adsorption, carbon capture, energy and hydrogen storage, drug delivery, bio-sensing and cancer detection. This is due to some of amazing properties that allow them to be utilized multiple functionalities including high porosity, distinguished structures, uniform morphologies, high stability, high magnetic properties and high conductivity.

This enzyme was isolated and purified from the bioremediation products of textile wastewater containing direct green azo dye in a UFC/CSA prototype bioreactor. To improve the enzyme stability, efficiency and recyclability, peroxidase was immobilized on Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles produced and modified by co-precipitation using glutaraldehyde. The immobilized enzyme was characterized by transmission electron microscopy analysis and examined against different pH as well as storage time and temperatures. The MNPs-immobilized peroxidise was remarkable stable towards temperature and pH perturbations, compared to the free enzyme form. Moreover, the immobilized peroxidase maintained its full activity upon storage at 4 and 25\u2009\u00b0C for 90 days, and upon recycling for up to 100 cycles. Finally, the MNPs-immobilized peroxidase was successfully employed to decolorize dyes of different chemical natures in a lab scale bioreactor. Hence, we believe that the immobilized peroxidase on magnetic nanoparticles reported in this work can be potentially used in various industrial and environmental applications."}{"A review of integrated photocatalyst adsorbents for wastewater treatment ": "Photocatalysis has the best potential to replace the conventional wastewater treatment technology due to its utilization of visible light to photo-degrade organic and inorganic contaminants. However, when applied in slurry form, agglomeration of nanoparticle will lead to serious decrease in photocatalytic performance due to hinderance effect. By combining the photocatalyst and adsorbents, which is designated as integrated photocatalyst adsorbent (IPCA), an adsorbent material which also degrades toxic organic compounds in the presence of UV/visible light irradiation could be produced. The compound does not only preserve all the interesting characteristics of both individual components, but also overcomes serious drawbacks, such as low absorptivity, rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and hinderance effect of photocatalyst when applied in slurry form. There are several criteria that must be obeyed by the absorbent material used such as high absorption capacity to target compound, reasonable transparency to UV\u2013vis light, high surface area, inhibition of photocatalyst leaching and good stability with dispersing solvent. In this review article, the authors presented an overview on the application of photocatalyst, adsorbents and integrated photocatalyst adsorbents for wastewater treatment. Moreover, the discussions were also focused on the major adsorbent which has been integrated with photocatalyst such as carbon, clays, zeolite matrix materials and others. Additionally, the mechanisms of the adsorption of emerging organic contaminants with adsorbents in IPCA were also discussed to clearly understand the possible interactions between organic contaminants and IPCA. Outlook on IPCA study were also discussed to further broaden the prospective of this technology."}{"Green synthesis of silver doped nano metal oxides of zinc & copper for antibacterial properties, adsorption, catalytic hydrogenation & photodegradation of aromatics ": "Silver doped copper and zinc nano metal oxides were synthesized in the presence of Sida rhombifolia leaf extract by self propagating sol-gel autocombustion process. X-ray diffraction studies indicated the formation of wurtzite hexagonal phase for ZnO, monoclinic for CuO and FCC structure for silver nanocomposites. The surface morphology of nanoparticles were studied using FESEM. FTIR studies confirmed the presence of silver & M\u2013O bonds. UV\u2013vis DRS studies revealed that silver doping reduced the band-gap energy which overcomes fast recombination rate of electron-hole pairs of the nanoparticles. TGA studies indicated enhanced thermal stability of doped nanocomposites. Hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with NaBH4 showed that Ag/ZnO & Ag/CuO exhibited greater photoreduction capacity than undoped ZnO & CuO. ZnO, Ag/ZnO, CuO & Ag/CuO nanocomposites have antagonistic effect on the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus with greater inhibition zones. Ag/CuO NPs exhibited the highest sensitivity against various bacterial strains with MIC below 1\u2009mg. Ag/CuO nanorods showed excellent adsorption properties with high removal capacity of MG of about 90%. Kinetic, thermodynamic and equilibrium studies on adsorption of MG onto Ag/CuO nanorods was carried out. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO and Ag/ZnO nanocomposites was investigated by studying the degradation of methylene blue & malachite green under UV irradiation. Ag/ZnO exhibited better photodegradation efficiency of MG & MB and follows pseudo first order kinetic model. Thus the simple, low-cost and eco-friendly herbal synthesis of oxides of silver doped zinc & copper provides nanocomposites with multifunctional applications."}{"Towards industrial implementation of Electro-Fenton and derived technologies for wastewater treatment: A review ": "This is an updated critical review of the advances towards the full exploitation of diverse Electro-Fenton technologies for the decontamination of real effluents at industrial scale. The main relevant innovations spanning almost three decades are analyzed from a historical perspective. Electro-Fenton, Photoelectro-Fenton, Peroxi-coagulation, Sonoelectro-Fenton and related methods are assessed. Economic aspects and engineering challenges that should be overcome to reach the title goal, such as efficient cathodes for H2O2 electrogeneration, heterogeneous catalysis, the pH issue, and the iron sludge problem are particularly highlighted. A special section is devoted to examining the R&D works on actual wastewaters. Overviews of both pilot scale studies currently available in the literature and companies that already provide some of these technologies are presented. Finally, suggestions for further development at a large scale, depending on wastewater characteristics, are summarized."}{"Review of indirect optical measurements of leaf area index: Recent advances, challenges, and perspectives ": "Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter of vegetation structure in the fields of agriculture, forestry, and ecology. Optical indirect methods based on the Beer-Lambert law are widely adopted in numerous fields given their high efficiency and feasibility for LAI estimation. These methods have undergone considerable progress in the past decades, thereby making them operational in ground-based LAI measurement and even in airborne estimation. However, several challenges remain, given the requirement of increasing accuracy and new applications. Clumping effect correction attained significant progress for continuous canopies with non-randomly disturbed leaves while non-continuous canopies are rarely studied. Convenient and operational measurement of leaf angle distribution and woody components is lacked. Accurate and comprehensive validations are still very difficult due to the limitations of direct measurement. The introduction of active laser scanning technology is a driving force for addressing several challenges, but its three-dimensional information has not been fully explored and utilized. In order to update the general knowledge and identify the possible error source, this study comprehensively reviews the temporal development, theoretical framework, and issues of indirect LAI measurement, followed by current methods, instruments, and platforms. Latest methods and instruments are introduced and compared to traditional ones. Current challenges, recent advances, and future perspectives are discussed to provide recommendations for further research."}{"Monitoring crop phenology using a smartphone based near-surface remote sensing approach ": "Smallholder farmers play a critical role in supporting food security in developing countries. Monitoring crop phenology and disturbances to crop growth is critical in strengthening farmers\u2019 ability to manage production risks. This study assesses the feasibility of using crowdsourced near-surface remote sensing imagery to monitor winter wheat phenology and identify damage events in northwest India. In particular, we demonstrate how streams of pictures of individual smallholder fields, taken using inexpensive smartphones, can be used to quantify important phenological stages in agricultural crops, specifically the wheat heading phase and how it can be used to detect lodging events, a major cause of crop damage globally. Near-surface remote sensing offers granular visual field data, providing detailed information on the timing of key developmental phases of winter wheat and crop growth disturbances that are not registered by common satellite remote sensing vegetation indices or national crop cut surveys. This illustrates the potential of near-surface remote sensing as a scalable platform for collecting high-resolution plot-specific data that can be used in supporting crop modeling, extension and insurance schemes to increase resilience to production risk and enhance food security in smallholder agricultural systems."}{"Water productivity of rainfed maize and wheat: A local to global perspective ": "Water productivity (WP) is a robust benchmark for crop production in relation to available water supply across spatial scales. Quantifying water-limited potential (WPw) and actual on-farm (WPa) WP to estimate WP gaps is an essential first step to identify the most sensitive factors influencing production capacity with limited water supply. This study combines local weather, soil, and agronomic data, and crop modeling in a spatial framework to determine WPw and WPa at local and regional levels for rainfed cropping systems in 17 (maize) and 18 (wheat) major grain-producing countries representing a wide range of cropping systems, from intensive, high-yield maize in north America and wheat in west Europe to low-input, low-yield maize systems in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. WP was calculated as the quotient of either water-limited yield potential or actual yield, and simulated crop evapotranspiration. Estimated WPw upper limits compared well with maximum WP reported for field-grown crops. However, there was large WPw variation across regions with different climate and soil (CV\u202f=\u202f29% for maize and 27% for wheat), which cautions against the use of generic WPw benchmarks and highlights the need for region-specific WPw. Differences in simulated evaporative demand, crop evapotranspiration after flowering, soil evaporation, and intensity of water stress around flowering collectively explained two thirds of the variation in WPw. Average WP gaps were 13 (maize) and 10 (wheat) kg ha\u22121 mm\u22121, equivalent to about half of their respective WPw. We found that non-water related factors (i.e., management deficiencies, biotic and abiotic stresses, and their interactions) constrained yield more than water supply in ca. half of the regions. These findings highlight the opportunity to produce more food with same amount of water, provided limiting factors other than water supply can be identified and alleviated with improved management practices. Our study provides a consistent protocol for estimating WP at local to regional scale, which can be used to understand WP gaps and their mitigation."}{"Response of crop yield to different time-scales of drought in the United States: Spatio-temporal patterns and climatic and environmental drivers ": "This article presents an analysis of the response of the annual crop yield in five main dryland cultivations in the United States to different time-scales of drought, and explores the environmental and climatic characteristics that determine the response. For this purpose we analysed barley, winter wheat, soybean, corn and cotton. Drought was quantified by means of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The results demonstrate a strong response in the interannual variability of crop yields to the drought time-scales in the different cultivations. Moreover, the response is highly spatially variable. Crop types showed considerable differences in the month in which their yields are most strongly linked to drought conditions. Some crops (e.g. winter wheat) responded to drought at medium to long SPEI time-scales, while other crops (e.g. soybean and corn) responded to short or long drought time-scales. The study confirms that the differences in the patterns of crop yield response to drought time-scales are mostly controlled by average climate conditions, in general, and water availability (precipitation), in particular. Generally, we found that there is a weaker link between crop yield and drought severity in humid environments and also that the response tends to occur over longer time-scales."}{"Spatio-temporal downscaling of gridded crop model yield estimates based on machine learning ": "Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) are essential tools for estimating agricultural crop yields and externalities at large scales, typically at coarse spatial resolutions. Higher resolution estimates are required for robust agricultural assessments at regional and local scales, where the applicability of GGCMs is often limited by low data availability and high computational demand. An approach to bridge this gap is the application of meta-models trained on GGCM output data to covariates of high spatial resolution. In this study, we explore two machine learning approaches \u2013 extreme gradient boosting and random forests - to develop meta-models for the prediction of crop model outputs at fine spatial resolutions. Machine learning algorithms are trained on global scale maize simulations of a GGCM and exemplary applied to the extent of Mexico at a finer spatial resolution. Results show very high accuracy with R2>0.96 for predictions of maize yields as well as the hydrologic externalities evapotranspiration and crop available water with also low mean bias in all cases. While limited sets of covariates such as annual climate data alone provide satisfactory results already, a comprehensive set of predictors covering annual, growing season, and monthly climate data is required to obtain high performance in reproducing climate-driven inter-annual crop yield variability. The findings presented herein provide a first proof of concept that machine learning methods are highly suitable for building crop meta-models for spatio-temporal downscaling and indicate potential for further developments towards scalable crop model emulators."}{"Improving leaf area index (LAI) estimation by correcting for clumping and woody effects using terrestrial laser scanning ": "Leaf area index (LAI) has frequently been measured in the field using traditional optical methods such as digital hemispherical photography (DHP). However, in the DHP retrieved LAI, there is always contribution of woody components due to the difficulty in distinguishing woody and foliar materials. In addition, the leaf angle distribution which strongly affects the estimation of LAI is either ignored while using the convergent angle 57.5\u00b0, or inversed simultaneously with LAI using multiple directions. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides a 3-dimensional view of the forest canopy, which we used in this study to improve LAI estimation by directly retrieving leaf angle distribution, and subsequently correcting foliage clumping and woody effects. The leaf angle distribution was retrieved by estimating the angle between the leaf normal vectors and the zenith vectors. The clumping index was obtained by using the gap size distribution method, while the woody contribution was evaluated based on an improved point classification between woody and foliar materials. Finally, the gap fraction derived from TLS was converted to effective LAI, and thence to LAI. The study was conducted for 31 forest plots including deciduous, coniferous and mixed plots in Bavarian Forest National Park. The classification accuracy was improved by approximately 10% using our method. Results showed that the clumping caused an underestimation of LAI ranging from 1.2% to 48.0%, while woody contribution led to an overestimation from 3.0% to 31.9% compared to the improved LAI. The combined error ranged from \u221246.2% to 32.6% of the leaf area index (LAI) measurements. The error was largely dependent on forest types. The clumping index of coniferous plots on average was lower than that of deciduous plots, whereas deciduous plots had a higher woody-to-total area ratio. The proposed method provides a more accurate estimate of LAI by eliminating clumping and woody effects, as well as the effect of leaf angle distribution."}{"Ear density estimation from high resolution RGB imagery using deep learning technique ": "Wheat ear density estimation is an appealing trait for plant breeders. Current manual counting is tedious and inefficient. In this study we investigated the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to provide accurate ear density using nadir high spatial resolution RGB images. Two different approaches were investigated, either using the Faster-RCNN state-of-the-art object detector or with the TasselNet local count regression network. Both approaches performed very well (rRMSE\u22486%) when applied over the same conditions as those prevailing for the calibration of the models. However, Faster-RCNN was more robust when applied to a dataset acquired at a later stage with ears and background showing a different aspect because of the higher maturity of the plants. Optimal spatial resolution for Faster-RCNN was around 0.3\u2009mm allowing to acquire RGB images from a UAV platform for high-throughput phenotyping of large experiments. Comparison of the estimated ear density with in-situ manual counting shows reasonable agreement considering the relatively small sampling area used for both methods. Faster-RCNN and in-situ counting had high and similar heritability (H\u00b2\u224885%), demonstrating that ear density derived from high resolution RGB imagery could replace the traditional counting method."}{"A DPSIR-analysis of water uses and related water quality issues in the Colombian Alto and Medio Dagua Community Council ": "A portion of Colombia\u2019s water resources is located on the Pacific coast within the territory of the Community Council of Alto and Medio Dagua (CC-AMDA). Though a harmonious balance between the communities\u2019 subsistent activities and nature was maintained for centuries, the appearance of modern modes of resource extraction has negatively affected the environment, especially the water resources. The Driver-Pressure-State- Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to analyze water quality problems within this community council. The DPSIR analysis revealed that agriculture, mining, logging and infrastructure development constitute important sectoral drivers with some contribution from tourism and fisheries. Pressures included inputs of organic matter, sediment, nutrients and chemical contaminants to the Dagua river, and to the Bay of Buenaventura. These produced corresponding State changes in the water bodies. Impacts on human welfare were poor public health, reduced food and water security, economic loss and some displacement. Societal Responses included public protests and campaigns, legal actions and policy changes for improved governance. As a future policy option, the formation of community-based water resources management is recommended. Though DPSIR was able to link cause-effect relations, further empirical research on these water bodies is necessary to fill in existing gaps in the data set, particularly for public health threatening contaminants."}{"Natural diatomite as an effective adsorbent for heavy metals in water and wastewater treatment (a batch study) ": "This study presents an evaluation of Egyptian diatomite as a low cost adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal under different conditions (pH, weight of diatomite and contact time). The adsorption of heavy metals was investigated under various pH values ranged from 2 to 8 at 25\u00b0C. The obtained results indicate that at low pH (2\u20134), the removal efficiency of diatomite for heavy metal increased slightly as the pH, adsorbent dose and contact time increased, while at pH>4, the percentage of metal ions adsorbed decreased with increasing pH due to precipitation of heavy metals. At pH equal 4, with using 2gL\u22121 of diatomite and 75min as contact time, the maximum adsorption capacity of diatomite was obtained. The high adsorption capacity of diatomite makes it a suitable low cost material for the removal of different heavy metals from aqueous solutions."}{"Sensitivity analysis and mapping the potential groundwater vulnerability zones in Birbhum district, India: A comparative approach between vulnerability models ": "The assessment of groundwater vulnerability is essential especially in developing areas, where agriculture is the main source of the population. In the present study, four different overlay and index method, namely, DRASTIC, modified DRASTIC, pesticide DRASTIC and modified pesticide DRASTIC are implemented with a view to identifying the most appropriate method that predicts the vulnerable zone to groundwater pollution. Sensitivity analysis reveals that net recharge is the most influential parameter of the vulnerability index. Cross comparison of model output shows the highest similarity of 97% is observed between drastic and modified drastic while the maximum difference in models prediction of 49% is observed between modified drastic and pesticide drastic. Reported nitrate concentrations in groundwater are considered for validation of model-generated final output map. The prediction power of the models are assessed using success and prediction rate method and it highlights DRASTIC model as the most suitable model with 89.69% and 84.54% of the area under area under the curve (AUC) for success and prediction rate respectively."}{"Groundwater: Extraction versus recharge; vulnerability assessment ": "The rising demands of groundwater for agricultural, due to the non-reliability of surface water sources have placed groundwater resource under serious pressure subjecting it to depletion and quality deterioration risks. Since, The Nile Delta aquifer is one of the most important renewable groundwater reservoirs in Egypt; it stands as the second source of water after the Nile, especially in the Nile Delta region. The Nile Delta aquifer is continuously recharged by irrigation water and through seepage from surface water. Moreover the Nile Delta aquifer is vulnerable to saltwater intrusion resulting from increasing groundwater abstraction. A 3D regional model for the Nile Delta aquifer system has been constructed to be used as a water management tool for different water management scenarios. The model was used to test the sensitivity of the aquifer to different extraction and recharge rates and investigate the system response on heads and salinity of the aquifer. The results confirmed that sensitivity of the aquifer to the tested parameters differs from one place to another."}{"Characterization of hydro chemistry and groundwater quality evaluation for drinking purpose in Adigrat area, Tigray, northern Ethiopia ": "This paper assesses the chemistry of groundwater and evaluate its quality for drinking purpose using water quality index (WQI) approach and comparing to WHO and Ethiopia water quality standards in Adigrat area in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Chemical composition of the groundwater in the area varies widely depending on the human activities. A total of 22 depth integrated groundwater samples were collected from 13 boreholes, 4 shallow, 4 hand-dug wells in addition to 1 reservoir, using purposive sampling technique. These samples were analyzed for physico-chemical parameters which include cations (Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, Manganese, Chromium, copper and Ammonia), anions (Fluoride, Chlorine, Nitrate, Nitrite, Bicarbonate, Sulphate and Phosphate) and other parameters (total hardness, hardness as calcium carbonate, Alkalinity pH, electrical conductivity, Total Dissolved solids) as well as physical parameters (turbidity, true color, odor and taste), were assessed to evaluate the groundwater quality for drinking.\n                  The groundwater is suitable for drinking purpose with respect to pH, EC, TDS and CaCO3 hardness as well as physical parameters (turbidity, true color, odor and taste). However, total hardness, iron, calcium, magnesium and chromium, the groundwater needs water treatment for quality adjustment. It is also suitable for drinking purpose taking into account all anionic concentrations (SO4\n                     \u22122, PO4\n                     \u22122, NO3\n                     \u22122, NO2\n                     \u2212, Cl\u2212, F\u2212 and HCO3\n                     \u2212). Generally, the cations, anions and the chemical parameters (total hardness, Calcium hardness, Alkalinity pH, electrical conductivity, Total Dissolved solids), are high around the town and old waste disposal sites as well as in cultivated agricultural fields where point and non-source of domestic, factories as well as fertilizers beside the nature sources.\n                  With respect to water quality index, 95.45% of the samples indicate that, the groundwater is classified under excellent where as 4.55% of the samples reflect the groundwater is poor and unsuitable class as far water quality index is concerned. According to water quality index guideline (Chaterjee and Raziuddin, 2002), the groundwater is suitable for drinking use generally with some restrictions. The objectionable groundwater is restricted around the town with main of contaminants domestic and factories wastes. The hydrochemical data reveal that the groundwater of the study area consists of six hydrochemical facies, (Ca\u2013Mg\u2013HCO3\u2013SO4, Ca\u2013SO4\u2013HCO3, Mg\u2013Ca\u2013SO4\u2013HCO3, Ca\u2013Mg\u2013SO4\u2013HCO3, Mg\u2013Ca\u2013HCO3\u2013SO4 and Ca\u2013HCO3\u2013SO4)."}{"Preparation of poly(thiourethane) thermosets by controlled thiol-isocyanate click reaction using a latent organocatalyst ": "s\n               \n                  Different poly(thiourethane) thermosets were prepared by means of a thiol-isocyanate click reaction starting from three diisocyanates with different structure (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI, 4,4\u2032-methylene bis(cyclohexy isocyanate), HMDI and hexamethylene diisocyanate, HDI, and a tetrathiol, pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate), PETMP. The curing process has been catalyzed by basic and acid catalysts. The use of a thermally activated base generator (1-methylimidazolium tetraphenylborate, BG1MI), which is an organocatalyst, allowed a better control on the curing initiation than those traditionally used dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) or tertiary amines. The curing evolution was investigated by DSC and FTIR spectroscopy.\n                  The materials obtained were characterized by thermomechanical and mechanical tests. Homogeneous materials were obtained in all cases. The chemical structure of the network was correlated with the thermal and mechanical data determined. Tg values in the range of 75 to 150\u202f\u00b0C were obtained. The thermal degradation of these materials has also been investigated and a complex degradation mechanism, with three different steps was observed in all cases. These materials showed a higher thermal stability than their oxygen counterparts did.\n                  The thermosets obtained using the latent organocatalyst have similar characteristics to the ones obtained by using the common DBTDL."}{"Synthesis and characterization of a novel inulin hydrogel crosslinked with pyromellitic dianhydride ": "Smart hydrogels with pH and enzyme triggered release suitable for colon specific drug delivery were prepared by crosslinking inulin with pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) in a simple one pot synthesis. Back titration, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV) demonstrated that the hydrogel crosslinking reaction resulted in ester linkages and carboxylic acid groups and that the amount of the crosslinker in the hydrogel increased with increasing PMDA concentration in the crosslinking reaction. Thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the chemical change by illustrating the hydrogels changed thermal properties and appearance compared to inulin. This hydrogel showed excellent swelling in water and the degree of swelling was inversely proportional to the cross-linking density, as determined using Flory-Rehner theory. Due to the presence of the carboxylic acid groups in the structure, the swelling was pH dependent, with significantly reduced swelling as acidity decreased from pH\u202f7.4 to pH\u202f1.2."}{"Preparation and evaluation of an eco-friendly, reactive, and phytic acid-based flame retardant for wool ": "Bio-derived phytic acid exhibits great potential to improve the flame retardancy of textile materials, but it has poor washing durability. In order to address this problem, an efficient, reactive, and phosphorus-containing flame retardant (FR) HPPHBTCA was synthesized using phytic acid, pentaerythritol and 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid, and the chemical structure of HPPHBTCA was characterized. HPPHBTCA was applied to develop FR functional wool fabric, and its FR efficiency and washing durability were evaluated. The wool fabric treated with 0.14\u202fmol/L HPPHBTCA had self-extinguishing performance even after 20 washing cycles during the vertical burning test, presenting good FR ability and resistance to washing. The catalytic char-forming effect of HPPHBTCA contributed to the enhanced FR and smoke suppression properties of wool fabric, and the ester bonds formed between HPPHBTCA and wool fiber resulted in the good washing durability. The HPPHBTCA treatment had a negligible effect on the whiteness, tensile strength and handle of wool fabric. This study offers a novel route to prepare the eco-friendly and durable FR agent using natural and phosphorus-containing compound."}{"Recent developments in sensing devices based on polymeric systems ": "This review is focused on the analysis of recent developments in the application of polymers in the detection and quantification of target species. The work begins with a description of the polymers that are employed as sensory materials, covering molecularly imprinted polymers or MIPs, hybrid polymers, acrylic polymers, conductive polymers, polymers with chiral motifs and also the use of polymeric arrays. After the description of the sensory polymers, the different target species which can be detected using sensory polymeric devices, including metallic cations and anionic species, gases, explosives, radionuclides and bacteria or the recent biomedical and biological applications is described. Finally, the sensory devices fabricated using smart polymers, including, for example, sensory devices based on Quartz Crystal Microbalances or the use of micro and nanoporous materials as substrates for sensory polymeric coatings is listed and reviewed. The work also details the different detection mechanisms based on the type of response of the sensory polymers, such as electrical, piezoelectric or fluorescence. In brief, the review details a review of the research work published in the last 10 years in this quickly evolving field, with special emphasis in the biomedical and biological applications, which have emerged recently raising great attention. To conclude, some perspectives and future challenges that must be overcome by this research field in the next years is exposed."}{"Statistical physics of ring polymers based on topological volume concept ": "Physical properties of ring polymers are subjected to topological constraint, understanding of which has been a significant challenge as a fundamental problem in polymer science. Here we overview a recent attempt to describe behavior of non-concatenated rings in their dense solution based on the notion of topological volume. Discussion includes the size scaling and dynamics of rings, and the phase behavior of blends containing ring polymers. We also discuss the bond correlation function of a ring in two-dimension, for which the non-crossing topological constraint plays a central role."}{"China starts-up its first grassroots ionic liquid alkylation unit ": ""}{"Catalytic processes reduce plastic waste via chemical depolymerization of pet and polystyrene ": ""}{"Wood density reduced while wood volume growth accelerated in Central European forests since 1870 ": "Forest stand growth dynamics in Central Europe have accelerated since 1870 due to a rise in temperature, extended growing seasons, and other components of climate change. Based on wood samples from the oldest existing experimental plots in Central Europe, we show that the dominant tree species Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.) exhibit a significant decrease in wood density since more than 100\u202fyears. While stand and trees grow faster with respect to wood volume, we can show that wood density decreased by 8\u201312% since 1900. These results object a na\u00efve direct transformation of volume growth trends into an accelerated biomass production. Since 1900, stand biomass increment increased 9\u201324 percentage points less compared to volume increment (29\u2013100% increase reduces to 20\u201376%). For a given stem diameter and annual ring width, tree stability against windthrow, wood strength, energy content and C sequestration are even reduced under recent conditions. The generally decreased late wood density, partly going along with an increased early wood fraction, suggests the observed extension of the growing season and fertilization effect of dry deposition as the main causes.\n                  Our results indicate that current increased wood volume growth rates must not be straightforwardly converted into sequestrated C and biomass harvest potentials assuming historic values for wood density. This should be taken into account in monitoring, modeling, and utilization of carbon and biomass in forests under global change."}{"Assessing, quantifying and valuing the ecosystem services of coastal lagoons ": "The natural conservation of coastal lagoons is important not only for their ecological importance, but also because of the valuable ecosystem services they provide for human welfare and wellbeing. Coastal lagoons are shallow semi-enclosed systems that support important habitats such as wetlands, mangroves, salt-marshes and seagrass meadows, as well as a rich biodiversity. Coastal lagoons are also complex social-ecological systems with ecosystem services that provide livelihoods, wellbeing and welfare to humans. This study assessed, quantified and valued the ecosystem services of 32 coastal lagoons. The main findings of the study are: (i) the definitions of ecosystem services are still not generally accepted; (ii) the quantification of ecosystem services is made in many different ways, using different units; (iii) the evaluation in monetary terms of some ecosystem service is problematic, often relying on non-monetary evaluation methods; (iv) when ecosystem services are valued in monetary terms, this may represent very different human benefits; and, (v) different aspects of climate change, including increasing temperature, sea-level rise and changes in rainfall patterns threaten the valuable ecosystem services of coastal lagoons."}{"Assessing the conservation potential of fish and corals in aquariums globally ": "Aquatic ecosystems are indispensable for life on earth and yet despite their essential function and service roles, marine and freshwater biomes are facing unprecedented threats from both traditional and emerging anthropogenic stressors. The resultant species and ecosystem-level threat severity requires an urgent response from the conservation community. With their care facilities, veterinary and conservation breeding expertise, reintroduction and restoration, and public communication reach, stand-alone aquariums and zoos holding aquatic taxa have great collective potential to help address the current biodiversity crisis, which is now greater in freshwater than land habitats. However, uncertainty regarding the number of species kept in such facilities hinders assessment of their conservation value. Here we analyzed, standardized and shared data of zoological institution members of Species360, for fish and Anthozoa species (i.e. Actinopterygii, Elasmobranchii, Holocephali, Myxini, Sarcopterygii and Anthozoa). To assess the conservation potential of populations held in these institutions, we cross-referenced the Species360 records with the following conservation schemes: the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES), the IUCN Red List of Threatened species, climate change vulnerability, Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) and The Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE). We found that aquariums hold four of the six fish species listed by the IUCN Red List as \u2018Extinct in the Wild\u2019, 31% of Anthozoa species listed by Foden et al. (2013) as vulnerable to climate change, 19 out of the 111 Anthozoa EDGE species, and none of the species prioritized by the AZE. However, it is very likely that significant additional species of high conservation value are held in aquariums that do not manage their records in standardized, sharable platforms such as Species360. Our study highlights both the great value of aquarium and zoo collections for addressing the aquatic biodiversity crisis, as well as the importance that they maintain comprehensive, standardised, globally-shared taxonomic data."}{"Identifying key factors, actors and relevant scales in landscape and conservation planning, management and decision making: Promoting effective citizen involvement ": "The paper analyses the current limitations of the constraints of decision and action processes in land-use, resource management and conservation policies and approaches, identifying their main factors, proposing alternative strategies to solve the present gaps and limitations. It identifies the need for a new paradigmatic approach based on innovative forms of involvement, commitment and individual and community rewarding systems. This approach is developed based on the characterization of the main drivers of land-use, resource management and conservation policies, namely \u03b1-perceptions (immediate and primary satisfaction) and k-perceptions (more mediate and complex consideration of satisfaction, implying long-term perceptions and collective benefits beyond the individual interests). It also analyses the effects of the introduction of new forms of income and incentives (such as trade-offs and payments for environmental services) or management approaches such as Ecological-Based Management or the use of Nature-Based Solutions. The main axioms and instruments necessary to build such a new paradigmatic approach (namely trade-offs, accountability and contractualization) are described. On this basis, it is possible to present a concept for an innovative institutional and social culture and a governance system aimed at an effective land-use, resource management and conservation policies. This governance concept is described and its sustaining individual, social and institutional drivers enunciated."}{"The use of ecological integrity indicators within the natural capital index framework: The ecological and economic value of the remnant natural capital of M\u00e9xico ": "In this paper, the ecological integrity hierarchy framework (EIHF) and the natural capital index framework (NCI) are integrated as decision-making tools for evaluating the natural capital of Mexico. Two hierarchy-levels of ecological integrity indicators are used to estimate the quality and quantity of the natural capital, the amount of ecological degradation and ecological sustainability. After human transformation, the extent still considered as \u201cnatural\u201d in the country is \u223c67%; while the amount of human transformed areas is \u223c33%, which gives a total estimate of NCI\u2009=\u20090.334; i.e., only \u223c33.4% of the national capital remains available, while \u223c33% is ecologically degraded. Furthermore, the critical natural capital; i.e., the legacy for future generations that remains in the country is only \u223c12%. The total estimated value of the current natural capital in Mexico is \u223c$457.1 billion/yr, which is \u223c435 times greater than the national GDP ($1.051 billion in 2010). The cost of maintaining the degradation of the natural capital is \u223c$144.6 billion/yr (\u223c138 times greater than national GDP in 2010). The potential value of the natural capital after restoration would be \u223c$602 billion/yr. Valuing the natural capital can be helpful for strategic environmental evaluations and useful for spatial decision support systems that evaluate natural capital as a decision-making tool."}{"Concern about climate change, biodiversity loss, habitat degradation and landscape change: Embedded in different packages of environmental concern? ": "Climate change and biodiversity loss are often seen as the two most serious environmental threats facing humanity. It also seems to be a common notion that concerns about these issues are embedded in the same package of environmental concern among the public. In this article, we probe the relationship between dimensions of concern about environmental challenges. In a general population survey in Norway, respondents were asked how concerned they were about several environmental issues. Factor analysis revealed that concern about climate change and concern about major causes of biodiversity loss, such as habitat destruction, loaded on different factors. When respondents ranked the three issues they were most concerned about, there was minimal overlap between climate change and biodiversity loss. It appears that relatively distinct profiles exist, based on different interpretations of current environmental challenges. The profiles are differently related to background factors such as social class, education and gender. These relationships are not strong, but the association between confidence in various institutional actors and the concern profiles is quite distinct, and different for the two. Further research is needed to properly elucidate drivers behind the different orientations."}{"National park affinity segments of overnight tourists differ in satisfaction with, attitudes towards, and specialization in, national parks: Results from the Bavarian Forest National Park ": "The study explored whether national-park affinity segments of tourists differ regarding their level of specialization in, attitudes towards, and satisfaction with, national parks between 2013 and 2014. The research categorized 429 overnight tourists to the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, into three affinity segments based on the role the national park played in their travel decision. More than the half of the respondents had a high or rather high national-park affinity. Differences in specialization, attitudes and satisfaction between the segments were found. However, differences were only observed between the more national park-interested segments compared to visitors who are not aware of visiting a national park or whose decision to visit the area was not influenced by the national park label, except for satisfaction. Tourists with higher national-park affinity had more positive attitudes towards, and were more specialized in, national parks and were more satisfied with nature conservation management. For satisfaction, most differences were observed between the segment with the lowest and the one with the highest affinity. Study findings may support sustainable park management and park affinity research."}{"More wilderness for Germany: Implementing an important objective of Germany\u2019s National Strategy on Biological Diversity ": "There are numerous reasons for the establishment of more wilderness areas. The issue is becoming more and more important worldwide, considering the increasing natural disruption. This also applies to densely populated countries like Germany. The National Strategy on Biological Diversity (NBS) sets goals for preserving and establishing more wilderness areas in Germany: 2% of the national land territory shall be designated to become large-scale wilderness areas and 5% of the forested areas in Germany are to be preserved as permanently unused woodland (areas). There may be partial overlaps since large forest areas of unused woodland qualify for both wilderness targets.\n                  The implementation of these wilderness objectives is achieved within the political framework through public administration activities, scientific work and communication.\n                  As a result of these activities a definition for wilderness areas in Germany as well as quality criteria for large wilderness areas in Germany have been developed. Furthermore, the potential for large wilderness areas was identified on a surface-oriented basis. These potential areas cover approximately 3.5% of Germany's land territory and can be found in woodlands, watercourses, coastlines, peatlands and high mountain ranges as well as in former military training grounds or mining areas.\n                  To support the wilderness targets, the Federal Government has made 156,000 hectares of federal land available as \u2018National Natural Heritage\u2019. To date, approximately 0.6% of the national land territory is protected as large-scale wilderness areas and approximately 1.9% of the forested area is designated to be permanently unused woodland; however, there is still a gap of 1.4% (large areas) and 3.1% (forests), to fulfill the targets of the NBS.\n                  It is shown, that no starting point of the natural state can be defined for \u2018wilderness areas\u2019. For a particular area to be classifiable as a wilderness area, natural processes without or with very slight human influence must be ensured.\n                  Our analysis reveals that the goals for more wilderness areas in Germany are ambitious, but achievable. The first steps for their realization, like the establishment of specific goals, the development of specific strategies and programs by the federal states and the demonstration of a realistic potential for more wilderness areas in Germany have been taken. However, the road to reach these goals is still long, and in the following years there is a continual need for numerous concerted activities by the relevant stakeholders in the field of wilderness."}{"The change in the attitudes of Czech hunters towards Eurasian lynx: Is poaching restricting lynx population growth? ": "Even though the Eurasian lynx is a less controversial species than the wolf or brown bear, poaching remains a major cause of lynx mortality in Europe, potentially threatening population expansion in key areas. Our study was designed to explore the attitude of hunters and other stakeholders (students of secondary forestry schools and University forestry faculties) towards lynx and their experience with illegal killing of lynx in the Czech Republic. Self-administered questionnaires were addressed to local hunters and to students in 2001 and again in 2015. The survey in 2001 was conducted in two separate hunting regions of Bohemia, one where lynx have been artificially reintroduced and another in which lynx have become established through natural colonisation. In 2015 the survey was extended to two further areas where lynx have re-established themselves through natural colonisation, in the east of the Czech Republic. Altogether 415 and 922 questionnaires were completed in 2001 and 2015, respectively. The attitude of hunters towards lynx was not affected by hunting region, lynx population density or nature of the population (human re-introductions vs natural recolonisation), but attitudes became more negative in 2015 than they had been in 2001. The majority of hunters still believed that lynx had negative effects on other wildlife and 27% stated that they do not wish to co-exist with lynx. Half of secondary school students and a third of tertiary students still believe that lynx threaten roe deer stocks, even though roe and red deer are present at high density and cause extensive damage in commercial forestry. Hunters as well as forestry students had first-hand knowledge about illegal hunting of lynx. The proportion of hunters admitting to having poached lynx themselves was 10% with the proportion of repeated illegal kills made by the same person increasing between 2001 and 2015. Population modelling suggested that at least 25% of the population might be poached annually, sufficient to restrict population growth and further expansion of lynx distribution."}{"The Fitness Check of the Birds and Habitats Directives: A discourse analysis of stakeholders\u2019 perspectives ": "In 2015, the European Union\u2019s Birds and Habitats Directives underwent an evaluation in which selected national stakeholders provided their perspectives on the directives\u2019 implementation. Analyzing the views of different stakeholder groups from eight European member states, this study found that these views could be synthesized into three more general perspectives. The first perspective focuses on problems, indicating that these are caused by legislative drawbacks in the directives. The second perspective holds that problems are generated by improper implementation by member states. The third perspective commends the benefits of the directives in face of the existing implementation problems. Interest groups and to a minor extent governmental bodies espoused the first perspective, and environmental non-governmental organizations especially favored the third. The struggle between these three perspectives reflects ongoing debates regarding positive and negative aspects of the directives and possibilities for improving their implementation. We conclude that the relevance and impact of conservation policies should never be seen as self-evident. In order to reach the conservation goals envisaged, continuous efforts are needed to enforce and maintain environmental legislation."}{"Mass-culling of a threatened island flying fox species failed to increase fruit growers\u2019 profits and revealed gaps to be addressed for effective conservation ": "Human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) pose a growing threat to biodiversity worldwide and solutions can be as sound as the understanding of the HWC itself. Conservation biologists therefore must carefully examine their local situations to inform on which approach and strategies may be best. In this context, Mauritius implemented what may be the first mass-culls of an already threatened native species when it culled the flying fox (Pteropus niger) in 2015 and 2016 to try increase fruit producers\u2019 profits. Although the Red List category of the species consequently worsened to \u2018Endangered\u2019 and fruit production dropped substantially, a third mass-cull was decided in 2018. A critical analysis is important to draw lessons that may help to prevent recurrences particularly that HWC involving Pteropus spp. are common and set to worsen. We synthesized the best literature available locally and also elsewhere in relevant situations, to critically appraise the setting, nature, timeline of events and outcome of both completed mass-culling campaigns to explore why and how they happened so as to help towards devising better approaches to such conflicts. The idea to cull P. niger originated around 2002 and a small cull was done in 2006. The first mass-cull started immediately after Mauritius\u2019 biodiversity protection law was weakened in 2015 primarily to legalize culls of threatened native species, but still breached the law in place then. The 2016\u2009mass-cull was recommended in line with the law, but was not evidence-based and consequently did not result in improved profits of fruit producers. Appeals supported by best scientific evidence from local and international organizations and conservationists to the effect that culls will not increase fruit production, but instead further endanger the species, were ignored. To forestall recurrences here and elsewhere, it matters to recognize their precursor signs and the conditions that favoured them including why the mass-culls were not stopped. The events provide a rare opportunity to explore the strategy that was used by conservationists and open the way to propose impactful alternatives or additional actions instead. The situation also exemplifies an eroding commitment towards biodiversity conservation, eased by withdrawal from evidence-based policy that suit short term goals of election cycles at the expense of longer term environmental interests."}{"Deforestation and the Paris climate agreement: An assessment of REDD+ in the national climate action plans ": "More than ten years after REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) entered the UN climate negotiations, its current state and future direction are a matter of contention. This paper analyses 162 INDCs (Intended National Determined Contributions), or climate action plans, to assess whether and how countries plan to use REDD+ in their implementation the Paris Agreement. Our analysis suggests that REDD+ continues to have political traction. Many tropical countries still have expectations of REDD+, and hope that public and private donors will support chronically underfunded domestic conservation programs. However, the expectations are not formulated in detail. We argue that until the questions of how to finance REDD+ and how to deal with the drivers of deforestation are resolved, REDD is unlikely to move quickly from formulated INDCs plans to implementation on the ground."}{"Towards sustainability? Forest-based circular bioeconomy business models in Finnish SMEs ": "In line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN 2030 Agenda, the circular bioeconomy concept is gaining greater political momentum and research interest. A circular bioeconomy implies a more efficient resource management of bio-based renewable resources by integrating circular economy principles into the bioeconomy. These ideas have been well received at industry level since they are deemed to foster cost reductions, innovation and competitiveness. While recent scientific literature has dwelt on sustainability-related circular business models, empirical research on company-level implementation is only just emerging. Our study contributes to addressing this research lacuna by seeking answers to two questions: 1. How do small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) propose, create and deliver, and capture value through circular bioeconomy business models?; and 2. What are the business challenges and opportunities related to the operationalization of such business models? To this end, we employed content analysis on interview data gathered from managers in Finnish SME companies from the field of packaging, textiles, composite materials, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. We outlined the main business model archetypes, and identified the key characteristics that enable value capture and delivery for various stakeholders. The contribution of this study is duly two-fold. From the perspective of a theoretical contribution, we expand and refine the conceptualization of sustainable circular bioeconomy and related business models. In addition, based on our findings, we provide insights and recommendations for researchers and policy-makers to advance the sustainability transition to a circular bioeconomy in the context of the forest-based industry, and for the management of SMEs to reflect on company viability and growth."}{"Exploring the design of jurisdictional REDD+: The case of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia ": "Jurisdictional approaches to REDD+ have received less attention than project-based REDD+ activities, yet they are needed for the successful implementation of REDD+ at the national level. Three subnational levels can be considered for the implementation of jurisdictional REDD+ in Indonesia: Provincial, District and Village. REDD+ implementation should involve all levels of jurisdiction, however, the implementation at the village level will be better coordinated at the district level due to the size of areas and potential emissions reduced. In this paper, we estimate the potential contribution of sub-national jurisdictions to reducing deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions using a case study from Central Kalimantan. District governments can contribute to reducing emissions by stopping deforestation from oil palm concessions, which in the case study considered has the potential of reducing emissions by as much as 15% from the business as usual scenario. Provincial governments have the authority to reduce emissions from state forest areas. In Central Kalimantan, if no more deforestation occurs in production forests, the projected avoided emissions between 2013 and 2020 are about 21% from the business as usual scenario."}{"Shifting regimes of management and uses of forests: What might REDD+ implementation mean for community forestry? Evidence from Nepal ": "At a time when many developing countries are preparing to implement REDD+, there is debate on the possible implications for existing community forestry (CF) governance. Drawing on a REDD+ pilot undertaken in Nepal, this paper seeks to investigate how REDD+ has been downscaled into the community forestry context and with what implications for CF governance. The analysis is guided by three research questions: how are the objectives and discourses underpinning REDD+ translated into actions at the local level; how do the proponents of REDD+ make the problems and solutions technical in order to design the interventions; and what are the implications of REDD+ design for CF governance and what changes in rules and practices on forest management might result from these? The study comprised a review of the pilot project documentation and field study. In-depth interviews, focused group discussions and observations were conducted with forest user groups both within and outside the REDD+ pilot area. Findings indicate that the pilot design and implementation was essentially to show that REDD+ could be implemented in CF and focused on developing a carbon monitoring mechanism which local people could be engaged in. The community forest user groups (CFUG) in the pilot sites have increased forest surveillance and tightened the rules regarding certain uses of forests. We argue that the technical and financial logic of REDD+ have had implications for CF governance, risks of co-opting local voices and has contributed to an ongoing commercialisation of community forests, at the cost of the livelihoods of the poorest people."}{"Sources of college EFL learners' self-efficacy in the English public speaking domain ": "The English language is playing an ever-increasing role in global cultural, political, and economic domains. This underscores a rapidly growing need for good English public speaking (EPS) skills among college students and a need to better understand instructionally manipulable factors, such as self-efficacy, that may contribute to EPS skills development. Grounded in Bandura's self-efficacy theory, this study investigated the degree to which four sources of self-efficacy\u2014 enactive mastery experience (EME), vicarious experience (VE), verbal persuasion (VP), and physiological and affective states (PAS)\u2014predicted EPS self-efficacy among 263 adult Chinese English as a foreign language learners. The overall results in the combined sample largely support Bandura's hypothesized sources of self-efficacy, with EME, VE, and VP\u2014but not PAS\u2014significantly making unique contributions to predicting EPS self-efficacy. The results by subsample highlight prior EPS course experience, gender, and academic major as factors that may impact the existence and the magnitude of the relationship between self-efficacy and its theoretical sources. This is particularly important for educators who wish to foster their students' EPS self-efficacy beliefs as the findings suggest that different groups of students may respond differently to their instructors' efforts. Pedagogical recommendations for EPS self-efficacy building are discussed."}{"Using corpus-based discourse analysis for curriculum development: Creating and evaluating a pronunciation course for internationally educated nurses ": "This paper discusses the development of corpus-based curriculum for ESP, with a focus on two underresearched areas: health care communication and the use of corpus materials for pronunciation. Three aspects of corpus-based curriculum development are explored: corpus-based needs analysis; corpus-based materials development; and corpus-based assessment and evaluation (Flowerdew, 2012; Tono, 2011). First, this paper briefly reports on a quantitative corpus-based analysis of 104 nurse-patient interactions that was conducted to identify needs of nurses in clinical interactions, with a focus on the findings related to pronunciation (pitch range, tone choice, and prominence/sentence stress). Key differences were found between international and U.S. nurse discourse in the use of these features. Next, the paper describes the curriculum for a Pronunciation for Nurses course, with an emphasis on corpus-based materials development from the corpus described above. Finally, the paper discusses the corpus-based assessment of participants' progress and an evaluation of the Pronunciation for Nurses curriculum, including pre and post-tests, interviews with nurse participants, interviews with ESL teachers, and course evaluations. The methods discussed in the paper have implications for other ESP contexts and other aspects of language use."}{"Register analysis and ESP pedagogy: Noun-phrase modification in a corpus of English for military navy submariners ": "Research in Maritime English (ME) has paid no attention to the range of texts and language to which Navy submariners are exposed during their training and professional careers. This research looked at Noun Phrase (NP)modification patterns in a longitudinal corpus of Submarine English (SE) professional texts in the Cartagena Military Submarine Corpus (CMSC). Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses, we found that SE is characterised by heavy nominal premodification, low adjective premodification, low prepositional phrase postmodification and by the predominant use of appositive nouns in postmodifying slots. These distinctive features of SE call for a register-sensitive pedagogy that unpack these characteristics and present them in context. We argue that the contribution of corpus linguistics is essential to explore registers which, for different reasons, have not been addressed or described linguistically in the past. Similarly, we maintain that the examination and teaching of NPs is essential to understand current trends in professional writing and communication."}{"A prosodic profile of American Aviation English ": "Aviation English is a codified register of English used by international pilots and controllers, derived from postwar American radiotelephony. Although regulations require proficiency in Aviation English, little has been done to describe it. The current study seeks to add to the literature by describing the prosodic profile, or rhythm and intonation, of American Aviation English as compared to Standard American English. Specifically, we examine corpora of air traffic controller speech and professional radio broadcasters\u2019 speech: two corpora of naturally produced speech. This study demonstrates that Aviation English has a more restricted pitch range, is faster, and exhibits less variable vowel durations and more variable consonant durations than Standard English. These prosodic differences from Standard English may create difficulties for Aviation English users, and indicate inaccuracy in the assumption that attaining proficiency in conversational English is sufficient for proficiency in Aviation English."}{"A corpus-based analysis of grammatical complexity as a measure of international teaching assistants\u2019 oral English proficiency ": "Oral English proficiency is one among several crucial factors to help determine the eligibility of international teaching assistants (ITAs) for various tasks associated with teaching undergraduate students at U.S. universities. The oral English proficiency test (OEPT) is a test used to screen prospective ITAs whose TOEFL speaking scores were below the cutoff required for admission and to determine whether they need additional support courses. Drawing on previous studies conducted in the context of oral assessment and university settings, ten grammatical features were selected to investigate grammatical complexity in the responses of the OEPT test takers. Our study explores which grammatical features are more frequently used by the test takers who passed and failed the test. The results show that the OEPT tasks elicited grammatical features commonly found in academic university registers (e.g., classroom teaching). Highly proficient test takers also used grammatical features commonly found in written texts and more extended spoken discourse (e.g., relative clauses) more frequently than lower proficiency ones. We hope that the findings of this study will inform the ongoing rating scale validation for ITA contexts by providing test developers and raters with specific evidence of grammatical features used by test takers at particular scores."}{"A three-dimensional model of personal self-mention in research papers ": "Self-mention in academic writing has been studied extensively, especially from the point of view of rhetorical functions. In this paper I argue that rhetorical functions represent only one dimension of self-mention. Adding the dimensions of grammatical forms and of hedging and boosting, I propose a three-dimensional model of self-mention. I then employ the model in the analysis of three types of writing in the field of linguistics \u2013 L1 English, L1 Slovak (a typologically different language), and L2 English writing by Slovak authors. The study shows that authors employ various degrees of the three dimensions of self-mention to meet expectations of their readers while maintaining a balanced power of self-mention. The results suggest that some, but not all, discourse practices related to self-mention might be transferred to L2 English from one's L1."}{"\u201cIn this paper we suggest\u201d: Changing patterns of disciplinary metadiscourse ": "Metadiscourse is the commentary on a text made by its producer in the course of speaking or writing. Here we take an interpersonal perspective, focusing on metadiscourse as a repertoire of resources available for writers to organise a discourse or their stance towards its content or the reader. In this paper we explore whether, and to what extent, metadiscourse has changed in professional writing in different disciplines over the past 50 years. Extending our diachronic work analysing a corpus of 2.2 million words from articles in the top journals in four disciplines, we show there has been a significant increase in interactive features and a significant decrease in interactional types. Surprisingly, interactional metadiscourse shows a marked decline in the discursive soft knowledge fields and a substantial increase in the science subjects."}{"Lexical bundles in stand-alone literature reviews: Sections, frequencies, and functions ": "Stand-alone literature reviews exist to synthesize the vast amount of data produced by modern academia, but to date, little research exists on this genre of written academic prose. The present study, therefore, investigates the frequency, dispersion, and discourse functions of lexical bundles in stand-alone literature reviews. A 3.4 million word corpus of 417 stand-alone literature reviews in psychology, education, and medicine was compiled, and four-word bundles occurring more than 40 times per million words were extracted. Part of the corpus was then divided into IMRD sections, (i.e., introduction, methods, results, and discussion), and the frequency, dispersion, and function of these lexical bundles were examined within each section. Results revealed that lexical bundles in stand-alone literature reviews were identical to those found in other studies of academic writing, which suggests that a core set of bundles for written academic prose may exist. However, the frequency of each bundle differed by section, and concordance lines presented a range of discourse functions. Bundles established research gaps, clarified results and methods, reported data, undergirded interpretations, and contextualized findings. Further research into lexical bundle frequency and use patterns within sections of stand-alone literature reviews is needed to establish pedagogical guidelines for lexical bundle use."}{"Immediate and long-run impacts of a forest carbon policy\u2014A market-level assessment with heterogeneous forest owners ": "Sequestering carbon in forests and wood products is an inexpensive way to reduce the atmospheric carbon concentration. However, its full potential is not utilized in present climate policies. Optimizing sequestration, while continuing to harvest wood for materials and energy, could reduce the economic burden of mitigation efforts. Optimal sequestration can be incentivized by subsidizing carbon storage according to its social value. We analyze the dynamic market-level impacts of implementing a forest carbon policy by using the Finnish Forest and Energy Policy model (FinFEP). We find that sizeable and immediate increases in carbon sinks can be obtained, even with low carbon prices. High carbon payments strongly increase the carbon sink in the short run, but this impact diminishes over time. Low payments have a milder but longer-lasting impact. Forest owners\u2019 valuations of forest amenities also affect the magnitude and dynamics of harvest and carbon sequestration results. Thus, a realistic description of forest owner behavior is needed to assess the impacts of forest carbon policies. Moreover, we show that a market-level model is necessary for assessing the regional carbon sequestration impacts and costs. Relying on stand-level models with fixed timber prices may yield overly optimistic results."}{"Participation and compensation claims in voluntary forest landscape conservation: The case of the Ruka-Kuusamo tourism area, Finland ": "The expansion of nature-based tourism on private land requires new mechanisms to coordinate tourism industry and commercial forestry interests. This attribute-based contingent valuation study elaborated the supply side of potential payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanism named Landscape and Recreational Values Trading (LRVT), proposed to enhance the provision of amenity values in privately owned forests located in tourism and recreation areas. Using a mail survey data set, we analyzed forest owners\u2019 willingness to participate in LRVT and the related compensation claims in the Ruka-Kuusamo area, Finland. We found that more restrictive rules regarding forest management practices decrease the probability of participating and increase forest owners\u2019 compensation claims in LRVT. Furthermore, forest owners seem to claim more compensation if, instead of private negotiations, competitive tendering is used to make contracts. Moreover, besides the protection of landscape values, biodiversity protection may be a motive for participation. This indicates that, in addition to improved landscape quality, respondents gain personal benefits from enhanced biodiversity in their own forests. The results can help in designing and implementing a future payment mechanism for the provision of forest landscape and recreational values in terms of how to proceed and whom marketing and recruiting efforts should target."}{"Carbon offsets out of the woods? Acceptability of domestic vs. international reforestation programmes in the lab ": "Following the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in November 2016, governments around the world are now expected to turn their nationally determined contributions into concrete climate policies. Given the global public good nature of climate change mitigation and the important cross-country differences in marginal abatement costs, distributing mitigation efforts across countries could substantially lower the overall cost of implementing climate policy. However, abating emissions abroad instead of domestically may face important political and popular resistance. We ran a lab experiment with more than 300 participants and asked them to choose between a domestic and an international reforestation project. We tested the effect of three informational treatments on the allocation of participants\u2019 endowment between the domestic and the international project. The treatments consisted in: (1) making more salient the cost-effectiveness gains associated with offsetting carbon abroad; (2) providing guarantees on the reliability of reforestation programmes; (3) stressing local ancillary benefits associated with domestic offset projects. We found that stressing the cost-effectiveness of the reforestation programme abroad did increase its support, the economic argument in favour of offsetting abroad being otherwise overlooked by participants. We relate this finding to the recent literature on the drivers of public support for climate policies, generally pointing to a gap between people's preferences and economists\u2019 prescriptions."}{"What ethanol prices would induce growers to switch from agriculture to poplar in Alberta? A multiple options approach ": "The emergence of second generation biofuel industries will be heavily dependent on future prices of ethanol, which could incent landowners to switch land uses from agriculture to growing biofuel feedstocks. In this study, we investigate price levels of ethanol that will be necessary for landowners to grow hybrid poplar. In such an emerging industry, landowners will face a great deal of uncertainty and will consider options to change their production decisions over time. To address this uncertainty, we construct a real options model that considers the dynamic option for Canadian landowners to switch from agriculture to poplar plantations, and also the option to sell poplar plantations for ethanol or pulpwood. The uncertainty in prices for poplar is characterized by time series models of prices for ethanol and pulpwood that characterize price variability as a GARCH process, and reversion to the long term mean average prices. Uncertainty for the value of land allocated to agriculture is characterised by a geometric random walk. Given these price processes, the real options models suggest that current average price levels would have to increase by approximately 35% (i.e. by 0.21 $/L) if only ethanol is considered as an end product, but this increase may be reduced to 32% (i.e., to 0.19 $/L) if the landowner has options to sell the poplar to either ethanol or pulpwood producers. On low value agriculture lands, estimates suggest that an 18% increase relative to current ethanol prices (i.e., of 0.11 $/L) would be needed, which is approximately equal to the current second generation subsidies in Alberta."}{"Does the expansion of biofuels encroach on the forest? ": "In this paper, we explore the role of biofuel production on deforestation in low- and middle-income countries. Since the 2000s, biofuel production has been rapidly developing to address issues of economic development, energy poverty and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the sustainability of biofuels is being challenged, particularly at the environmental level, due to their impact on deforestation and the GHG emissions they can generate as a result of land-use changes. In order to isolate the impact of bioethanol and biodiesel production among classic determinants of deforestation, we used a fixed effects panel model of 112 low- and middle-income countries between 2001 and 2012. Firstly, we found a positive relationship between bioethanol production and deforestation in these countries, among which we highlighted the specificity of Upper-Middle-Income Countries (UMICs). An acceleration of incentives for the production of biofuels from 2006 onwards enabled us to highlight higher marginal impacts for the production of bioethanol in the case of low- and middle-income countries and UMICs. Secondly, for low- and middle-income countries, these results are not significant before 2006. Thirdly, biodiesel production appears to have an impact on deforestation before 2006 on both subsamples. These last two results seem surprising and could be related to the role of biofuel production technologies and the crop yields used in their production."}{"\n               Giardia: an under-reported foodborne parasite ": "Foodborne zoonotic pathogens are a serious public health issue and result in significant global economic losses. Despite their importance to public health, epidemiological data on foodborne diseases including giardiasis caused by the enteric parasite, Giardia duodenalis, are lacking. This parasite is estimated to cause \u223c28.2 million cases of diarrhoea each year due to contamination of food, but very few foodborne outbreaks have been documented due to the limitations of current detection as well as surveillance methods. The current method for the recovery of Giardia cysts from food matrices using immunomagnetic separation requires further standardisation and cost reduction before it can be widely used. It also should incorporate downstream molecular procedures for genotyping, and traceback and viability analyses. Foodborne giardiasis can be potentially controlled through improvements in national disease surveillance systems and the establishment of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point interventions across the food chain. Studies are needed to assess the true prevalence and public health impact of foodborne giardiasis."}{"Deep amplicon sequencing as a powerful new tool to screen for sequence polymorphisms associated with anthelmintic resistance in parasitic nematode populations ": "Parasitic gastrointestinal nematodes contribute to significant human morbidity and cause billions of dollars per year in lost agricultural production. Control is dependent on the use of anthelmintic drugs which, in the case of livestock parasites, is severely compromised by the widespread development of drug resistance. There are now concerns regarding the emergence of anthelmintic resistance in parasitic nematodes of humans in response to the selection pressure resulting from mass drug administration programs. Consequently, there is an urgent need for sensitive, scalable and accurate diagnostic tools to detect the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. Detecting and measuring the frequency of resistance-associated mutations in parasite populations has the potential to provide sensitive and quantitative assessment of resistance emergence from an early stage. Here, we describe the development and validation of deep amplicon sequencing as a powerful new approach to detect and quantify the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with benzimidazole resistance. We have used parasite communities in sheep to undertake a proof-of-concept study of this approach. Sheep provide an excellent host system, as there are multiple co-infecting trichostrongylid nematode species, each likely with a varying prevalence of benzimidazole resistance. We demonstrate that the approach provides an accurate measure of resistance allele frequencies, and can reliably detect resistance alleles down to a frequency of 0.1%, making it particularly valuable for screening mutations in the early stages of resistance. We illustrate the power of the technique by screening UK sheep flocks for benzimidazole resistance-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms at three different codons of the \u03b2-tubulin gene in seven different parasite species from 164 populations (95 from ewes and 69 from lambs) in a single MiSeq sequencing run. This approach provides a powerful new tool to screen for the emergence of anthelmintic resistance mutations in parasitic nematode populations of both animals and humans."}{"Application of the Microsoft Excel Solver tool in the solution of optimization problems of heat exchanger network systems ": "Optimization of heat exchanger networks (HENS) is a field of interest in Chemical Engineering. The aim is to use the residual heat of process streams to raise the temperature of other process streams which are cold, thus minimizing the use of hot and cold utilities. The usual way to deal with this task is to pose a linear programming problem according to a transshipment model in order to minimize either the general services consumptions or the number of hot and cold stream matchings required. This optimization is subjected to several restrictions given by the energy balances corresponding to each heat exchange.\n                  The high number of variables and equations obliges the use of specific software to solve these problems, e.g. GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System). However, this software is not intuitive and requires a long time of training and a certain level of practice for the students to adequately use it.\n                  This work describes the use of Microsoft Excel-Solver for the sequential solving of HENS optimization problems according to the transshipment model. Solver is a much simpler, intuitive and easily available tool for the students who, besides, usually learn how to use it in the first years of their degree, in Informatics or similar subjects. Thus, it is not necessary to spend extra time in the teaching of the software, time that may be devoted to other contents.\n                  This paper presents an example of HENS problem proposed in the subject Simulation and Optimization of Chemical Processes corresponding to the Joint Master in Chemical Engineering of the Rey Juan Carlos University and the Aut\u00f3noma University of Madrid and solved by the students using Excel-Solver."}{"Workshops of innovation in chemical engineering to train communication skills in science and technology ": "This paper shows the application of an innovate pedagogical approach based on the project-based learning technique, focused on the training of communication skills in the framework of a workshop of innovation in chemical engineering. Written, graphical verbal, and non-verbal communication were tackled. For that purpose, a project of technological innovation was developed by the students in teams within the specific area of chemical engineering. A professional-like environment was simulated by a final workshop where the students defenced and supported their project by using oral presentation and production of a poster and a video. Several surveys were performed before and after the project application. The final survey revealed that both students and lecturers perceived an improvement on the communication skills of the students. Moreover, both lecturers and students declared satisfaction with the methodology, recommending its application in other disciplines."}{"Flipped classroom with cooperative learning as a cornerstone ": "This article discusses the reasons for flipping a classroom in an Engineering course and for including cooperative learning, supported by the literature. The case study then notes the challenges in changing the teaching mode, for example, in building front-loaded resources, and in coaxing students into using them. Bloom\u2019s taxonomy enables constructive alignment, adding a significant third pedagogic adjustment. Evidence from students shows what worked and what didn\u2019t. Findings were likely to alert other lecturers attempting greater student engagement to what is entailed and to the commonality of time-expense when improving learning outcomes. Then student feedback on the learning experience was analysed to show their perspective on the changes, and to be used to fine-tune the course for a second cycle of action research. The results showed that flipped classroom helped to develop and improve students\u2019 learning and critical analysis skills. Furthermore, cooperative learning improved students\u2019 communication skills and enabled them to build their teamwork and problem-solving skills. More than 90% of students agreed that flipped classroom with cooperative learning enabled them to extend their skills. Nonetheless, we show how much work is required to achieve this, and what pitfalls lie in the way."}{"Potential impact on the recruitment of chemical engineering graduates due to the industrial internship ": "Preparing, finding and making the transition from a Bachelor degree level to a successful job in the profession of Chemical Engineering requires not only an investment of time and effort but also prior training in a work placement environment, which allows the development and strengthening of the professional skills of the future graduates. A central aspect of this process is the ongoing consideration of an industrial internship to take advantage of the goals, strengths and opportunities that such alternative offers to undergraduate students. The Industrial Internship Program of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Universidade de Santiago de Compostela prepares third- and fourth-year college students to successfully integrate and thrive in the professional world and to have their first experience in a real-life work context, supported by a dynamic community of administrative and teaching staff and employers. Companies that collaborate in the training of future chemical engineers are distributed throughout the national territory, which allows a strong connection with the socioeconomic environment."}{"A successful experience with the flipped classroom in the Transport Phenomena course ": "Transport Phenomena is a core subject in Chemical Engineering studies. Its fundamentals need significant effort to be understood. Furthermore, students must apply theory to solve practical engineering problems, and it is usually problem resolution which has the largest weight in course assessment. However, due to the high amount of theory that must be covered in Transport Phenomena courses, usually little classroom time is reserved for practice and problem-solving skills are not worked in class. This constitutes a serious misalignment between learning activities, expected outcomes and evaluation. In this article, we propose the flipped classroom as a suitable methodology to solve this issue. As a pilot study, we flipped one unit of the Transport Phenomena course of the Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Chemical Engineering. Theory was provided through whiteboard animated video before the classroom sessions. Classroom time was mainly dedicated to participative discussion and problem solving in small groups. Satisfaction questionnaires were used to monitor student perception of learning quality before and after the methodology update. Student judgement on the interest of the subject and the value of the learnt concepts boosted about 20% on average with the flipped classroom. Around 70% of the surveyed students reported that the new methodology increased their motivation and that it helped them to learn both theory and practice. These results indicate that the flipped classroom is suitable for highly-technical classes with a large amount of complex theory, and it helps in the understanding and application of such theory."}{"Programming skills in the industry 4.0: are chemical engineering students able to face new problems? ": "A reflection on teaching programming at undergraduate level using advanced tools is presented. Advanced digital tools and computational evolution have shaped different areas, such as industrial process, communications, education and innovation. New technologies, such as the Internet of Things-IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, have boosted software development and computational skills in different areas. The chemical engineering knowledge acquired by senior students and programming skills can be integrated to develop computational tools, favoring chemical engineers to take advantage of new opportunities in digital area. Normally, programming courses are offered at the beginning of chemical engineering program, with examples not related to chemical engineering problems. To fill this gap, an elective discipline was created for final year undergraduate students in the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil). This paper discusses the main motivations for a new programming course, presents the structure of the course and shows some outcomes from a students' survey about what they have learned."}{"Learning by doing: Chem-E-Car\u00ae motivating experience ": "Since 2013 a group of professors from the Chemical Engineering Department of Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) has implemented a teaching tool based on the concept of \u201clearning by doing\u201d that has been successfully used in the US to increase motivation of students. This tool consists of a competition, called Chem-E-Car\u00ae, which helps to teach not only specific, but also transversal competences of the undergraduate students. They have to design, build and move a car controlled by a chemical reaction that it has to travel a specified distance while carrying a certain amount of water.\n                  The Chem-E-Car\u00ae World Competition took place at the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering, in 2017, and the students\u2019team from UCM presented a Chem-E-Car\u00ae moved by a battery based on an oxidation-reduction reaction and stopped by means of an iodine timer. It has been the first time that UCM has competed and the first time that the competition has taken place in Spain.\n                  Chem-E-Car\u00ae has contributed to develop both the application of Chemical Engineering knowledge and professional skills. Chem-E-Car\u00ae project has allowed the students to incorporate new abilities, such as team-working, leading, facing personal and professional troubles, interpreting and applying rules, project management and safety hazards."}{"Professional design of chemical plants based on problem-based learning on a pilot plant ": "This work describes a novel teaching methodology and its application in a subject framed in the last course of the master\u2019s degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Seville. The main aim consists of promoting a way to facilitate professional practice in this field to the students. Authors also aim at guiding the transition to the new learning requirements demanded by the European Higher Education Area (EHEA).\n                  The novel methodology is based on the development of a detailed design of a pilot plant that can be further evaluated by the students themselves. Students are also allowed to run experiments at the facility and carry out several standard tests to verify the quality of the results of their works. The novelty of this proposal consists of incorporating a real installation available in our department to drive new learning methodologies applied in Chemical Engineering curricula. The methodology is distributed across several tasks: training (self-learning), project execution and supervision, comparison with a real installation and pilot plant experiences. The application of the proposed teaching methodology provided quality didactic material production, high satisfaction of the students with the new learning approach and the fact that they gained practical experience at industrial scale."}{"Development and application of scoring rubrics for evaluating students\u2019 competencies and learning outcomes in Chemical Engineering experimental courses ": "This paper reflects on the interest of several teachers in reviewing the instruments and evaluation processes in Chemical Engineering experimental courses taught during three consecutive academic years at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid: Engineering Laboratory, Experimentation in Chemical Engineering and Process Scale-up.\n                  In this study, a methodology has been proposed to design, develop, and apply rubrics based on competence and learning outcome approaches. Thanks to the collaborative work of the three teaching teams involved, the application of comprehensive rubrics to provide gradual attainment of competence and formative evaluation over the academic years was rendered possible.\n                  Rubrics were developed to evaluate the main tasks of the courses: Personal Work, Written Report, and Oral Presentation. The rubric for each task contained the same evaluation criteria and dimensions with four levels of achievement, but differed in the scoring strategy depending on the course in which the rubric was implemented.\n                  The use of evaluation rubrics had a low impact on the final students\u2019 grade; its greatest impact was on Personal Work, as a larger number of students achieved higher scores. The rubrics fostered transparency in the evaluation process of the students and homogenized the evaluation criteria for a large number of teachers (22) and students (180 per year)."}{"\n               KBR (Kinetics in Batch Reactors): a MATLAB-based application with a friendly Graphical User Interface for chemical kinetic model simulation and parameter estimation ": "The simulation of chemical kinetic models is necessary in order to analyze comprehensive chemical reaction mechanisms and perform the estimation of the kinetic parameters. In many cases, a chemical process can be composed of several series and/or independent reactions that requires a complex set of kinetic equations to be solved. Computer-based tools for the study of kinetics of chemical reaction networks have been used since the last 50 years. However, the educational tools in this field should be friendly for the user and easy to learn and adapt to practical cases, avoiding long frustrating learning curves. Herein, the main objective of this contribution is to present a Matlab\u00ae application for the evaluation of Kinetics in Batch Reactors (KBR), which will help students to estimate kinetic parameters of complex chemical reaction models. The KBR application was used in the Final Degree Projects of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Engineering Degrees at Rey Juan Carlos University (Spain). This application provides a friendly Graphical User Interface to formulate any kind of kinetic model for subsequent simulation in order to monitor the evolution of reagents and products along the reaction time. Moreover, the student will be able to estimate kinetic parameters according to available experimental data as well as to apply sensitivity analysis of those parameters for particular cases of chemical reactions in batch systems. Finally, the results can be exported for further analysis as a spreadsheet of an Excel\u00ae file (.xlsx)."}{"Incorporating life cycle assessment and ecodesign tools for green chemical engineering: A case study of competences and learning outcomes assessment ": "Chemical engineers assume a broad range of roles in industry, spanning the development of new process designs, the maintenance and optimization of complex systems, and the production of intermediate materials, final products and new technologies. The technical aptitude that enables chemical engineers to fulfill these various roles along the value chain makes them compelling participants in the environmental assessment of the product in question. Therefore, the introduction of life cycle assessment (LCA) and ecodesign concepts into the chemical engineering curriculum is essential to help these future professionals to face design problems with a holistic view of the technical, economic, social and environmental impacts of their solutions. The teaching of these and other disciplines by means of student-centered methods, based on a holistic structure, have demonstrated better teamwork and communication skills. For that reason, this paper proposes a Micro (Assess-Analyze-Act) (M-3A) model of assessment mainly focused on closing the loop of the learning activities. This model has been applied to an ecodesign case study of the \u201cUniversity master\u2019s Degree in chemical engineering\u201d of the University of Cantabria/University of the Basque Country, with positive feedback of the students. They felt that the approach has allowed them to utilize their analytical skills in quantifying a situation before applying other subjective measures, and that the public discussion of the results was a satisfactory element for improving their communication skills. Moreover, the students found that the workload was nicely adjusted, highlighting the acquisition of 4 competences preferentially: teamwork, creativity; relevance of environmental issues and initiative and entrepreneurship. Finally, the students suggest that the application of this methodology into their degree could motivate future students improving their performance."}{"Learning-by-Doing: The Chem-E-Car Competition\u00ae in the University of Cantabria as case study ": "It is widely known that the Learning-by-Doing (LbD) pedagogical tool is not the most common form of education in Chemical Engineering nowadays. The aim of this work is to describe the application of LbD considering as case of study the participation of undergraduate students from the Chemical Engineering Degree of the University of Cantabria (UC) from Spain in the Chem-E-Car Competition\u00ae in the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering (WCCE10). The Chem-E-Car Competition\u00ae is a world-known student event run by AIChE, which provides chemical engineering undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in a team-oriented hands-on design and construction of a small prototype car powered by a chemical reaction. Within the context of the WCCE10, the competition gathered 18 teams from different countries all around the world. The UC team ended in the 6th position and won the award to the best inherent safety design. Overall, the benefits outpaced the time cost both for students and the teaching staff. This situation was not clear at the beginning of the project.\n                  Prior to this competition, LbD was used as an innovative pedagogical tool for the requested acquisition of competences. The proposal of a multi-annual Final Degree Programme was a win\u2013win situation for all the stakeholders. From a teaching point of view, the LbD let transferable and core competences to be evaluated not only internally, but also externally thanks to the competition. A survey was completed among the students that participated in the project. Competences such as \u201cProblem-solving\u201d and \u201cAdaptation to new situations\u201d were pointed out as those which were developed in a higher level by the students."}{"Improving the internship experience in the master of chemical engineering at the University of Granada ": "The purpose of this paper is to analyze the present status of the internship program of Master of Chemical Engineering at the University of Granada and establish a systematic model to annually acquaint the satisfaction of students. It will allow the improvement of the internship program according to the opinions of students. The authors have examined a total of 33 items grouped in 7 different blocks. The results showed that the majority of students were satisfied with the internship program. Students recognized that the possibility of carrying out the internship abroad and improve the soft skills are some of the advantages of the internship offer of master\u2019s degree. In fact, most of them prolonged their training period in order to perform their final Master project in the research center where they had carried out their internship. Some aspects should be improved, namely the communication between the academic tutor and the students, the information and guidance in the internship selection or the proposal of practices in more varied sectors. The findings of the present study had let to propose improvements for the internship program."}{"An analysis of efforts to scale up clean household energy for cooking around the world ": "Approximately 3 billion people, most of whom live in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, rely on solid fuels (i.e. wood, crop wastes, dung, charcoal) and kerosene for their cooking needs. Exposure to household air pollution from burning these fuels is estimated to account for approximately 3 million premature deaths a year. Cleaner fuels \u2013 such as liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, electricity, and certain compressed biomass fuels \u2013 have the potential to alleviate much of this significant health burden. A wide variety of clean cooking intervention programs are being implemented around the world, but very few of these efforts have been analyzed to enable global learning. The Clean Cooking Implementation Science Network (ISN), supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and partners, identified the need to augment the publicly available literature concerning what has worked well and in what context. The ISN has supported the development of a systematic set of case studies, contained in this Special Issue, examining clean cooking program rollouts in a variety of low- and middle-income settings around the world. We used the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adaptation, implementation, maintenance) framework to coordinate and evaluate the case studies. This paper describes the clean cooking case studies project, introduces the individual studies contained herein, and proposes a general conceptual model to support future planning and evaluation of household energy programs."}{"Ghana's rural liquefied petroleum gas program scale up: A case study ": "Background\n                  The Government of Ghana launched the Rural LPG (RLP) promotion program in 2013 as part of its efforts to reduce fuelwood consumption. The aim of the RLP is to contribute to Ghana's overarching goal to provide LPG access to 50% of Ghana's population by 2020. The RLP has not announced long-term program objectives. However, in the interim the RLP targeted a cumulative total of 170,000 LPG cookstoves to rural households by the end of 2017. As of November 2017, 149,500 rural households had received the LPG cook stoves. Our case study documents Ghana's experiences to date with LPG scale up.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  We carried out a desktop review/document analysis of literature on the RLP. Each document was reviewed for information related to the elements of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework as it pertained to LPG promotion and adoption. In-depth interviews were held among key stakeholders in Ghana. Previously collected data from a field evaluation of the RLP was also assessed.\n               \n               \n                  Findings\n                  Generally, our evaluation suggests that the current form of the RLP is not achieving its stated goal. Our evaluation of the RLP in five rural communities showed that about 58% of households had never refilled their LPG cylinders nine months after the initial delivery of a filled cylinder. Only 8% still used their LPG at 18\u202fmonths post distribution. Cost and distance to LPG filling stations were the main reasons for low LPG use. Beneficiaries did not exclusively use their LPG even at the initial stages when all of them had LPG in their cylinders. Ghana is currently undergoing transitions in the LPG sector including a change from the current private cylinder ownership model to a cylinder recirculation model for the distribution of LPG. There was no evidence of a well-documented implementation framework for the RLP.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Fuel cost, poor LPG access, and an inadequate implementation framework hinder the RLP implementation."}{"The Mega Conversion Program from kerosene to LPG in Indonesia: Lessons learned and recommendations for future clean cooking energy expansion ": "Background\n                  In 2007, the Indonesian Government instigated a national program to convert domestic kerosene users to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking. This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies.\n               \n               \n                  Objective\n                  To review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP).\n               \n               \n                  Methods and data sources\n                  Searches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys. The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia. Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used. Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015. Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households. While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Addressing HAP and the health impacts associated with kerosene and biomass use was never an objective of the program. Consequently, there is limited evidence of impact in this area, and in hindsight, missed opportunities in terms of influencing cooking behaviour change among biomass users, who are more at risk."}{"Africa Biogas Partnership Program: A review of clean cooking implementation through market development in East Africa ": "This paper analyses the Africa Biogas Partnership Program (ABPP) in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. ABPP was established in 2009 to promote adoption of biodigesters by rural households in sub-Saharan Africa. We use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) with information from literature, internal documents, primary data from user surveys and interviews with sector stakeholders.\n                  ABPP was implemented with the primary objective of establishing viable biodigester markets. By 2017, Kenya made most progress toward commercial viability, evidenced by market entry of companies offering prefabricated digesters and establishment of 22 marketing hubs, which link rural organizations with local construction enterprises and finance institutions. In Uganda 5 marketing hubs were established and in Tanzania 7. Between 2009 and 2017 over 27,000 households installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. Additional objectives include improving agricultural productivity by using bio-slurry, improving health, reducing deforestation, and improving livelihoods.\n                  Households perceive higher crop yields (84%\u201391% of users), reduced fuel consumption (84%\u201394% of users), reduced eye problems and respiratory symptoms (45%\u201391% of users). Benefits most appreciated are \u201ceasy cooking\u201d and \u201csaving time and money\u201d. Fuel consumption tests show households with biodigesters use 2.1 to 3.3 fewer tons of wood per year than similar households without biodigesters.\n                  The ABPP case study suggests that the program has created a nascent biodigester market in East Africa. The country programs have been dynamic and adaptive, moving along the cycle of market development; however, many challenges remain. For example, while half of the adopters in Kenya exclusively use biogas for cooking, in Uganda and Tanzania fuel stacking is more prevalent, making it more difficult to achieve health and environmental objectives. In addition, high upfront cost, limited access to credit, and lack of maintenance present challenges. In 2016, 27% of biodigesters constructed between 2009 and 2013 were not working. In response, ABPP implemented call centers and launched campaigns to repair non-functioning plants. To ensure long-term viability and increase the likelihood of achieving environmental and health goals, we suggest deeper engagement with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and a targeted campaign promoting exclusive use."}{"Implementation and scale-up of a biomass pellet and improved cookstove enterprise in Rwanda ": "This paper reviews the experience of a for-profit firm in Rwanda promoting biomass pellets and a fan micro-gasification improved cookstove as a clean cooking alternative to charcoal. Consumers purchase locally produced biomass pellets and receive the improved cookstove on a lease basis. The cost of the pellets and stove(s) is lower than the cost of cooking with charcoal in the urban setting where our study takes place. Inyenyeri has been piloting its business model since 2012. Using data from an ongoing quantitative impact evaluation study, focus group discussions, and a series of key informant interviews, we chronicle the firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production, and marketing, highlighting lessons for the design of private sector-led clean cooking interventions.\n                  We find that 38% of households marketed to as part of our ongoing impact evaluation study adopted the pellet and stove system, but that approximately 45% of those who adopted suspended contracts after signing up. The firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production, pricing structures, and customer service strategies have influenced implementation, adoption rates, and scale-up. Customer preferences for specific stove attributes and willingness of stove manufacturers to modify stoves for local conditions have influenced both the firm's choice of stove and customer satisfaction. In 2015 the firm transitioned customers from the Philips stove to the Mimi Moto, a decision which created confusion among consumers, and affected adoption rates. Despite the challenge of establishing and scaling-up pellet production in central Africa, the firm increased production 400% between 2014 and 2017 to reach 800,000\u202fkg/year. Importing and maintaining pelletizing equipment in Rwanda is costly, the supply of feedstock irregualar, and undercapitalization of the firm have affected production. With respect to marketing, after experimenting with a sign-up fee and a minimum monthly purchase of pellets, the firm has decided to transition to a pay-as-you-go system to reduce perceived risk by consumers. A high-level of customer service including in-home visits, free in-home repair, and home delivery of pellets are major innovations. The long pilot phase and the evolutionary nature of the firm's activities illustrate both the complexity of building a market for clean cooking, and the time required to understand nascent markets and consumer demand."}{"Barriers to Large-scale Solar Power in Tanzania ": "The Tanzanian official power system expansion plan shows a dominant dependence on fossil fuel-fired power plants till 2040. Hence identifying and analysing the underlying barriers for the deployment of large-scale renewables are essential. This study investigates the barriers to large-scale solar power in Tanzania. Key institutional, financial, and technological barriers are identified at different levels. The study uses a qualitative methodology where primary data is collected through 30 semi-structured interviews with experts representing the main electricity sector's stakeholders from public institutions, research institutions, private investors, civil society organizations, development partners, and financial institutions. A stakeholder-based approach which emphasizes the different perceptions of the stakeholder's groups is used to identify the barriers. Institutional barriers for the diffusion of large-scale solar power technologies are found to be predominant, and they often trigger financial and technological barriers. The study consolidates the view that foreign investment and aid directed to expand electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa need to be reshaped in order to be a driving force towards sustainable energy transition in the region. The study argues for the possibility to work on the compatible interests between the pro-renewables development partners and the Tanzanian government (which considers expanding electrification as a political priority) through introducing large-scale solar power projects that help in expanding electrification while being technically and financially supported by the development partners."}{"Pay-As-You-Go financing: A model for viable and widespread deployment of solar home systems in rural India ": "Decentralised Solar Home Systems (SHSs) are established as an effective strategy to connect the \u2018last mile\u2019 without electricity access and leapfrog communities to clean energy solutions. According to the World Bank, the Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model has emerged as one of the effective commercially viable solutions to provide decentralised energy access to rural and remote communities in developing nations. The paying ability of households is a critical challenge for energy enterprises, and PAYG, with its easy payment schemes makes solar units affordable and allows households to gradually own these systems. The model also offers user training, ongoing maintenance, and service blocking functionality that minimises investment risk. The PAYG model has demonstrated huge success in Sub-Saharan Africa where Kenya pioneered the model as a cost competitive modern alternative for kerosene. One in five people in India lack access to electricity, and grid-connected rural communities often face frequent blackouts. With the advancement in distributed solar technologies and growing penetration of the mobile telecommunications network in India, PAYG could advance into a successful model to electrify communities living off the grid. Our analysis involves a two-dimensional approach where a systematic review of PAYG literature including case studies from Kenya and India was performed, followed by three expert interviews to further augment learnings and opportunities to deploy PAYG SHSs in India. This analysis finds that India's socio-political context seems suited for increased PAYG penetration, including utilising the opportunity provided by the country's Unified Payments Interface. This paper offers insights for practitioners and policymakers to consider the PAYG model to deploy clean electricity to households and rural micro-enterprises."}{"A case study of the ethanol CleanCook stove intervention and potential scale-up in Ethiopia ": "Background\n                  Approximately 80% of Ethiopia's energy consumption is dominated by woody biomass fuel use, resulting in 91.2\u202fmillion\u202ftons of firewood and 4.2\u202fmillion\u202ftons of charcoal consumed annually. Ethiopia's dependency on non-sustainable energy, especially for cooking, has been a major concern for the nation for the past 30\u202fyears, contributing to deforestation, climate change, and adverse human health impacts.\n               \n               \n                  Objectives\n                  Our objective was to document the work of Gaia Association and the implementation of the ethanol CleanCook stove in the refugee camp and urban settings of Ethiopia. We then assessed the potential for the scale-up of ethanol as a household fuel.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  We utilized the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the ethanol cookstove intervention. We obtained secondary data from a variety of sources to evaluate a.) The performance of the CleanCook ethanol stove; b.) Effectiveness of the ethanol cookstove implementation; and, c.) Barriers to scale-up and commercialization of ethanol use as a household fuel. In addition, we conducted primary analysis of qualitative surveys to evaluate the perceptions of the ethanol and adoption of the CleanCook stove.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Our case study results provide critical insight into the 13-year implementation of the CleanCook ethanol stove in Ethiopia. Laboratory tests demonstrate that the CleanCook stove reduces harmful emissions compared to biomass stoves, and preliminary field tests show 24-hour average PM2.5 levels of 200\u202f\u03bcg/m3. To-date 8731 CleanCook stoves were distributed to refugee households, while an additional 500 were sold at a subsided price to low-income urban households. CleanCook stove users report the continued use of multiple stoves.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The CleanCook ethanol stove has been implemented as an energy intervention for the vulnerable refugee population in Ethiopia for over 13\u202fyears. There has been limited success of a subsidized CleanCook stove among low-income households in Addis Ababa. This case study demonstrates the complexities of promoting a new fuel for household cooking, and the numerous obstacles and stagnations in implementation. Ethanol demonstrates some potential for scale-up and commercialization as a household fuel in Addis Ababa, but it may require simultaneous stabilization of ethanol supply, growth of a city-wide distribution infrastructure, and an affordably priced stove and fuel."}{"Comparison of load profiles in a mini-grid: Assessment of performance metrics using measured and interview-based data ": "Mini-grids are seen as an important option for increasing access to electricity in non-electrified rural areas where grid-extension is unfeasible. Appropriately dimensioning and constructing mini-grids requires knowledge of electricity usage. There is currently a lack of measured load profiles from mini-grids and the most common method for estimating electricity usage is through appliance data collected via interviews. Thus, this paper compares and investigates the differences between measured daily load profiles and daily load profiles created from appliance data collected through interviews and how the two methods impact the dimensioning and operation of a mini-grid. This is done by comparing load profiles for an entire mini-grid, a household and SME customers with large loads. The paper reports differing results from the two methodologies. Generally, the results show that the interview-based load profiles fail to provide an accurate overall estimate. The calculated performance metrics for the two methods also shows large differences. The interview-based load profiles mainly fail to provide accurate estimates of energy and the energy related (capacity factor and load factor) performance metrics. Accordingly, the implications for mini-grid operators and developers could be significant. The interview-based load profiles indicate the mini-grid system to be considerably less technically and economically desirable than measurements show. Suggestions for how the interview process can be improved are presented."}{"Energy access through electricity storage: Insights from technology providers and market enablers ": "In recent years, deployment of standalone electricity systems to provide energy access in a rural context has increased rapidly. These systems typically incorporating variable renewables alongside electrical energy storage for consistent supply, and operate at a range of scales to provide a range of services. However, there has been relatively little analysis of storage technology choices made by providers of these systems, how this varies by application, how these are influenced by priorities of providers, and how these choices could be improved. Here, we present findings from a series of interviews with providers of off grid energy solutions on choice and availability of technologies, supply chains, realised costs, technology performance, environmental impact, and anticipated impact of future technology development. Based upon these, we make recommendations for regulators and individual companies on how technology choices and life cycle management could be improved."}{"Development of renewable, densified biomass for household energy in China ": "Recent national strategic plans in China have set renewable energy targets for rural household energy programs, including those that advance the production of densified biomass fuels (e.g. pellets, briquettes) for use in household cooking and heating stoves. There is presently very little information on potential barriers to the successful development of densified biomass for household cooking and heating in China, but such knowledge may be informative in settings that aim to replace unprocessed coal and other polluting fuels with renewable, cleaner-burning energy sources. We designed a case study to coordinate data-gathering efforts at rural field sites in southwestern Sichuan province and northeastern Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, where production of densified biomass fuels is under development for household end-users. We conducted interviews with factory personnel, local administrative leaders, and sector experts involved in the production and distribution of densified fuel, including pellets and briquettes, for household use. Results from our qualitative textual data analysis yielded several recommendations for improving development of densified biomass fuels for household end-use. These included reducing heterogeneity of feedstocks, increasing financial support for operational costs (e.g. collection, transport, and storage of raw materials; storage and distribution of final products), improving household perceptions of and subsequent demand for densified biomass fuels, and increasing enforcement of national and provincial policies banning the use of coal and open-field biomass burning. Collection and storage of raw materials and the final densified fuel product were consistently noted as critical challenges to scaling up production at all three sites. Finally, the perspectives of factory managers and local village administrators that we present also indicated that production of densified biomass fuels would most likely be more successful and reproducible in places where national-level policies are viewed as obligatory."}{"Government policy, clean fuel access, and persistent fuel stacking in Ecuador ": "After more than three decades of access to low-cost liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) financed by large direct government subsidies, >90% of Ecuadorian households cook primarily with LPG. Due to the large fiscal burden of the LPG subsidy, increases in electricity from hydropower, and other socio-political factors, the Government of Ecuador has launched a major induction stove program (PEC) to reduce the demand for LPG. We assess the effects of the LPG subsidies and PEC using government records, interviews, academic literature, newspaper reports, household surveys, and focus groups. Household surveys, conducted in rural, northern Ecuadorian households (n\u202f=\u202f383), characterized cooking patterns and fuel access. Focus groups (n\u202f=\u202f6) were carried out with a subset of surveyed households to better characterize survey findings. The LPG subsidy was developed as part of broad social support reforms in the early 1970s, without specific aims to reduce the health impacts of household air pollution from woodfuel or provide economic benefits as part of the transition to a clean cooking fuel. Nonetheless, the subsidy has resulted in nearly all Ecuadorian households cooking primarily with LPG. PEC has generated the sale of 740,000 induction stoves since its inception in 2014, short of the goal of 3.5 million. Among the rural households surveyed, LPG use, acceptance, and satisfaction was high, however, more than three-quarters of those surveyed reported weekly woodfuel use. Induction stove ownership (17%) and use as a primary cooking fuel (1%) was low among the rural households surveyed; furthermore, households owning induction stoves reported very low satisfaction with the stoves. Here we show that nationally-representative surveys reporting only \u201cprimary cooking fuel\u201d use may underestimate solid fuel use as a supplemental household cooking energy, particularly in rural areas where fuel availability issues play a stronger role in decisions about what fuels to use."}{"Assessment of the Cambodian National Biodigester Program ": "The National Biodigester Program (NBP) was established in 2006 to build and maintain household biodigesters in Cambodia. In its first six years, the program installed almost 20,000 biodigesters and established an in-country network of local financiers, construction companies, skilled masons, bioslurry specialists and after-care technicians accessible to rural users in 14 of 24 Cambodian provinces. Since its initial success, the program's adoption rates have stalled despite increasing government support and high rates of user satisfaction. Building on an initial evaluation of the NBP in 2013, this updated assessment identifies multiple changes in its second implementation phase that have undermined the initial momentum of the program. Abrupt interruptions in institutional support, deteriorating supply side services (access to construction agents, masons, repair services) and reduced access to credit for farmers have eroded the service network that the first implementation phase established. Structural changes in the rural economy may also contribute to declining demand. Government support to another biodigester program which offers a lower investment price, but does not provide after-sales services, has also undercut the long-term implementation strategy of the NBP. The paper finds that despite these programmatic changes, the installed biodigesters continue to perform according to expectation and to be maintained and valued by their users, but the future viability of the program remains uncertain."}{"The Government-led initiative for LPG scale-up in Cameroon: Programme development and initial evaluation ": "In 2016, the government of Cameroon, a central African country heavily reliant on wood fuel for cooking, published a Masterplan for increasing primary use of LPG from 20% to 58% of households by 2035. Developed via a multi-sectoral committee with support from the Global LPG Partnership, the plan envisages a 400 million Euro investment program to 2030, focused on increasing LPG cylinder numbers, key infrastructure, and enhanced regulation. This case study describes the Masterplan process and investment proposals and draws on community studies and stakeholder interviews to identify factors likely to impact on the planned expansion of LPG use."}{"Variability in the organic carbon stocks, sources, and accumulation rates of Indonesian mangrove ecosystems ": "Mangrove ecosystems are an important natural carbon sink that accumulate and store large amounts of organic carbon (Corg), in particular in the sediment. However, the magnitude of carbon stocks and the rate of carbon accumulation (CAR) vary geographically due to a large variation of local factors. In order to better understand the blue carbon sink of mangrove ecosystems, we measured organic carbon stocks, sources and accumulation rates in three Indonesian mangrove ecosystems with different environmental settings and conditions; (i) a degraded estuarine mangrove forest in the Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL), Central Java, (ii) an undegraded estuarine mangrove forest in Berau region, East Kalimantan, and (iii) a pristine marine mangrove forest on Kongsi Island, Thousand Islands, Jakarta. In general, Corg stocks were higher in estuarine than in marine mangroves, although a large variation was observed among the estuarine mangroves. The mean total Corg stock in Berau (615\u202f\u00b1\u202f181\u202fMg\u202fC ha\u22121) is twice as high as that in SAL (298\u202f\u00b1\u202f181\u202fMg\u202fC ha\u22121). However, the Segara Anakan Lagoon displayed large within-system variation with a much higher Corg stock in the eastern (483\u202f\u00b1\u202f124\u202fMg\u202fC ha\u22121) than in the central lagoon (167\u202f\u00b1\u202f36\u202fMg\u202fC ha\u22121). The predominant accumulation of autochthonous mangrove organic matter likely contributed to the higher Corg stocks in Berau and the eastern SAL. Interestingly, the CAR distribution pattern in SAL is opposite to that of its Corg stocks. The central SAL that receives high sediment inputs from the hinterland has a much higher CAR than the eastern SAL (658\u202f\u00b1\u202f311\u202fg\u202fC m\u22122 yr\u22121 and 194\u202f\u00b1\u202f46\u202fg\u202fC m\u22122 yr\u22121, respectively), while Berau has one of the highest CAR (1722\u202f\u00b1\u202f183\u202fg\u202fC m\u22122 yr\u22121) ever measured. It appears that these large differences are driven by the environmental setting and conditions, mainly sediment dynamics and hydrodynamics, landform, and vegetation conditions. It is inferred that quantifying carbon accumulation in sediments is a useful tool in estimating the present-day carbon storage of mangrove ecosystems. This is a precondition for taking measures under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) schemes."}{"Hydrodynamic modelling of tidal-fluvial flows in a large river estuary ": "The transition between riverine and estuarine environments is characterised by a change from unidirectional to bidirectional flows, in a region referred to herein as the Tidally-Influenced Fluvial Zone (TIFZ). In order to improve our understanding of the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of this zone, we present a combined field and numerical modelling study of the Columbia River Estuary (CRE), USA, tidally-influenced fluvial zone. The CRE is large measuring 40\u202fkm in length and between 5 and 10\u202fkm wide. A shallow water model (Delft3D) was applied in both 2D and 3D configurations and model sensitivity to the key process parameterizations was investigated. Our results indicate that a 2D model constrained within the estuary can sufficiently reproduce depth-averaged flow within the TIFZ of a stratified estuary.\n                  Model results highlight the interactions between tidal-, fluvial- and topographic-forcing that result in depth dependent tidal rectification, and thus zones of residual sediment transport that: i) may be flood-directed along shallow channel margins and in the lee of bars, and simultaneously ii) is ebb-directed within deeper channel thalwegs. This condition is enhanced at lower discharges, but increased fluvial discharge reduces the number and size of regions with net flood-directed sediment transport and flow. These sediment transport patterns provide a mechanism to extend the bar/island topography downstream, and generate flood-directed, ebb-directed, and symmetrical bedforms, all within the same channel. Analysis of the model data reveals flood-directed sediment transport is due to both tidal variability and mean flow. These results highlight the need to include the mean flow component (M0) when considering the long-term morphodynamic evolution in a TIFZ."}{"Parasite contamination of berries: Risk, occurrence, and approaches for mitigation ": "Fresh fruits and vegetables, including berries, are essential components of a healthy diet and are relevant in the prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Associations between diet and health are becoming an increasing focus of consumers, and, in response, consumption of fresh berries has been increasing rapidly in recent decades. However, increased consumption of berries may be associated with an increased risk of acquiring foodborne infections, including parasites. In this review, we describe how parasite contamination of berries may occur at several points on the farm-to-fork pathway, starting from the use of contaminated water for irrigation and pesticide application, and contact with animal and human faeces during cultivation, through contaminated harvesting equipment, and including unhygienic practices of berry pickers in the production field or others handling berries prior to consumption. Parasite transmission stages tend to be robust and therefore likely to survive from contamination in the field, through the various stages of harvesting, packaging, and sale, until consumption. We describe outbreaks of parasitic disease associated with consumption of berries \u2013 so far only described for Cyclospora and Trypanosoma cruzi, both of which are briefly introduced \u2013 but also show from survey data summarised in this review that sporadic infections or undetected outbreaks associated with contaminated berries may also occur. In addition, we describe methods for assessing whether berries are contaminated with parasite transmission stages, with emphasis on the challenges associated with analysing this particular matrix. Emphasis on current possibilities for mitigation and control are addressed; avoidance of contamination and implementation of good management practices and a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) approach are essential."}{"Recent advancements in the control of Taenia solium: A systematic review ": "The combined health and economic impact of Taenia solium urges for control and, if possible, elimination of this neglected parasitic zoonosis. Up till now there is still no consensus about the most cost-effective and feasible approaches for control. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and summarize the evidence in English scientific literature on the control and elimination of T. solium since 2014, based on the rapidly evolving field of evidence on control and elimination of T. solium. The search resulted in the identification of 458 records of which 31 were included, covering 13 field trials and 18 articles containing experimental data, mathematical models, and other information directly relevant the control of T. solium.\n                  Recent field studies confirm that combinations of interventions or multiple rounds are more successful in obtaining rapid reductions in transmission and parasite occurrence, with the quick impact of the combination of human and pig treatment confirmed in a South Asian and Peruvian context. Moreover, elimination of transmission through a one-year intensive program, combining human and pig treatment/vaccination was described in a Peruvian study. Recent studies also provide more data on the positive impact of specific health education, as well as newly developed electronic educational tools, providing opportunities for area specific community-engaged participatory interventions.\n                  Once control has been achieved, monitoring of migration of both potentially infected people and pigs from outside the control area is important for sustained disease control."}{"International Commission on Trichinellosis: Recommendations on the use of serological tests for the detection of Trichinella infection in animals and humans ": "Serological methods are widely used for detection of infections in animals and humans. The recommendations provided here take into account the best current methods for the serological detection of Trichinella infection. They are based on current scientific information including unpublished data from laboratories with relevant expertise in this field. These recommendations represent the official position of the International Commission on Trichinellosis (ICT) regarding acceptable methods for the use and interpretation of serology testing for Trichinella infection in animals and humans.\n                  The ICT does not recommend use of serological methods for testing individual carcasses of animals at slaughter for assuring food safety. For detection of human infections, for epidemiological studies in animals and humans, and for monitoring Trichinella infection in swine, the ICT recommends ELISA using excretory/secretory (ES) antigens. These antigens are obtained from the in-vitro maintenance of Trichinella spiralis muscle larvae and are recognized by sera from hosts infected by all Trichinella species and genotypes identified thus far. In most situations, positive results obtained by ELISA should be confirmed by western blot. Serological assays should be properly standardized and validated for their intended purpose. The components of the test that are critical for maintaining suitable performance should be identified and appropriately checked. Users of commercial tests should verify that the test has been adequately evaluated by an independent body. Serology is useful for detecting Trichinella in animals and humans but its limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting the results."}{"Nationwide simulation of water, energy, and food nexus: Case study in South Korea and Indonesia ": "Water, energy, and food (WEF) scarcity has been realized as a global issue, and several strategies have been proposed to solve this problem. The WEF Nexus is a novel concept in resources management that integrates and considers feedback connections of water, energy, and food production and consumption in a single framework. The discussion of WEF Nexus commonly involves several parties with different backgrounds and expertise to decide sustainable management plan. This paper introduces a computer simulation model to calculate the supply and consumption, availability, and reliability of water, energy, and food resources on a nationwide scale considering the interconnections of resources. Developed based on a system dynamics algorithm, the Water-Energy-Food Nexus Simulation Model (WEFSiM) simulated the nationwide resources nexus implementing the changes of energy policy in South Korea and capital investment planning of urban water systems in Indonesia. Successfully calculating the reliability index of resources and evaluating the feedback analysis in both case studies, WEFSiM can investigate resource security under plausible future conditions, and stakeholders possibly could utilize it as a decision support tool."}{"Study on sky rivers: Concept, theory, and implications ": "Presented in this paper is an introduction to the study on sky rivers, especially the concept, theory, and implications. A sky river is in essence a generalization for a rich variety of meteorological systems including tropical cyclones, extratropical frontal cyclones, shear lines and others from the viewpoint of fluid mechanics. All these meteorological systems share a common feature that, there exists a contacting surface between two air masses with contrasting velocities, temperatures, humidity, and pressures. Under the forces caused by large gradients of state variables normal to the contacting surfaces and other forces, concentrated water vapor flows along paths on the contacting surfaces like river channels on earth surface, characterized by cloud and precipitation processes along the paths. A simplified and direct approach to identify the sky rivers is proposed on the basis of their physical interpretation. Results show that the sky rivers globally exist and have close relations with precipitation. In mathematics, the sky rivers are the discontinuity surfaces of the governing equations for atmospheric flows, and they are formulated in this study as the characteristic surfaces where the characteristic values are real and the derivatives normal to the surface do not exist by means of general theory for partial differential equations to provide a description for time\u2013space evolution of the sky rivers. Finally, future study areas regarding the sky rivers are discussed."}{"Using ensemble precipitation forecasts and a rainfall-runoff model for hourly reservoir inflow forecasting during typhoon periods ": "This study proposes an integrated hydrometeorological system combining a fully physically based rainfall-runoff model (i.e., kinematic-wave-based geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph model, KW-GIUH) with a numerical weather model (i.e., Taiwan cooperative precipitation ensemble forecast experiment, TAPEX) for performing hourly reservoir inflow forecasting patterns in the Shihmen Reservoir, in Northern Taiwan. If there is an accurate reservoir inflow with enough lead time, it could help reservoir operators to efficiently operate reservoirs in both dry and wet times of the year. Five historical typhoons, having severe impacts on the study reservoir, were used for model calibration, validation, and further application. For accurate reservoir inflow forecasting, it is necessary to understand a series of uncertainties that occur in this system. Therefore, the present study assessed the forecast uncertainty of the peak inflow and cumulative reservoir inflow on the basis of several TAPEX runs. Using the average forecasting result derived from all TAPEX runs could be less uncertain than randomly choosing a run\u2019s result. For example, the results for Typhoon Saola (2013) showed that the uncertainty in the cumulative reservoir inflow ranged \u221231.3% (first TAPEX run) to 27.0% (sixth run); otherwise, its average forecasting result was only \u22120.9%. On the basis of the analyzed typhoons, the proposed system can provide accurate forecasts of the magnitude and timing of the peak inflow when rainfall distribution is concentrated during typhoon events. The results demonstrated that the proposed hydrometeorological system can substantially represent reservoir inflow forecasting in the Shihmen Reservoir and provide valuable information for operating reservoirs."}{"Experimental study of flow characteristics around floodplain single groyne ": "This study investigated the flow around river\u2019s floodplain single groynes. Two different compound channels with one and two symmetrical floodplains having widths of 1- and 2-times of the main channel width, respectively, were used. Both impermeable and permeable groynes with three different relative lengths (relative to the floodplain width) and having three different permeability values of 40, 60, and 80% were investigated. The 3D flow velocities were measured in the horizontal plane at 0.25 and 0.5 of floodplain water depth (hf), and in the vertical plane at the main channel\u2019s centerline. Therefore, the flow velocities in the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical directions, and the flow water surfaces were measured and analyzed. The results showed that, as the groyne permeability increased up to 60%, a reduction of up to 30% to the maximum velocity and 22% to the tip velocity were observed. The permeable groyne length had limited influence on the flow structure. Both the groyne permeability and the length ratio had significant effects on the floodplain water depth. The scouring and the deposition activities resulting from impermeable groynes can be avoided, should the groyne length be kept below half of the floodplain width."}{"Erosion and sedimentation patterns associated with restoration structures of bendway weirs ": "Bendway weirs (B.W.), known as new and innovative river training structures, are positioned from the outer bank of the river bend and angled upstream toward the flow. In order to investigate the effect of bendway weirs on the sediment process, experiments were conducted in a 90\u00b0 bend with a relative curvature of 3.3 with and without bendway weirs. Following the installation of bendway weirs with different crest slopes, the scour and sedimentation patterns were evaluated under clear water conditions. To this end, a series of B.W. (7 weirs) with three crest slopes (0, 5, and 10 percent) were installed at the outer bank side in different hydraulic conditions. Erodible bed topography measurements revealed that the maximum scour depth occurred at the tip of the first and last weirs. Moreover, the findings of this study clearly demonstrates the potential of bendway weirs in modifying morphology of river bends and their efficiency in reducing erosion and sedimentation. In general, compared to non-weirs condition, the eroded sediment volume increased by 53, 36, and 15 percent due to the installation of weirs with crest slopes of 0, 5, and 10 percent, respectively. Finally, this study revealed that the maximum scour depth decreased with an increase in the crest slope."}{"Field monitoring and design optimization of dropshafts with air circulation pipes ": "Dropshafts with air circulation using an airshaft and horizontal air circulation pipes have been implemented for reducing downstream sewer air pressure and preventing sewer odor emission. There is a need to optimize the design for improved effectiveness and cost-saving. A one-week field monitoring program on a dropshaft with air circulation pipes was conducted in Edmonton, Canada, in order to validate the air flow model and assess the performance of the dropshaft with different air circulation pipe configurations. The air flow model was based on the upstream/downstream conditions of the dropshaft which were obtained from the field monitoring program. This study showed that the horizontal air circulation pipes on the top positions were more efficient in re-circulating air and depressurizing the downstream than the bottom ones, and increasing the size of the top horizontal air circulation pipes could significantly improve their effectiveness. This study provides guidance for designing or retrofitting dropshafts with air circulation pipes."}{"A review on ancient urban stream management for flood mitigation in the capital of the Joseon Dynasty, Korea ": "Korean historical documents have abundant records of river works. Extensive related records during the Joseon Dynasty (CE 1392\u20131910) were investigated and analyzed. The evolution of man-made urban stream, Cheonggyecheon the center of old downtown Seoul, Korea was reviewed. In 1410, after a big flood, 52,800 soldiers were mobilized from whole country to improve waterway in the capital. King Sejong continued to enhance the river maintenance. The dredging and expansion for main stream including tributaries was conducted to reduce flood risk. It was a landmark river engineering project for the improvement of the capital\u2019s infrastructure. King Yeongjo planned and initiated the massive river work project. 200,000 people were recruited from five local provinces to widen the stream and to build up the stone embankments, and the waterways were straightened up to present conditions. After the project, the Juncheonsail, a construction report was published and adopted as a practical guideline for river management. As a result, floods in downtown of the capital had been somewhat controlled though, since then every King of the Joseon Dynasty had deep consideration on river maintenance including dredging and embankment against flood and sedimentation. This paper aims to introduce a brief history of the systematic urban river management in ancient Korea."}{"Sustainable Industry 4.0 framework: A systematic literature review identifying the current trends and future perspectives ": "Industry 4.0 and its other synonyms like Smart Manufacturing, Smart Production or Internet of Things, have been identified as major contributors in the context of digital and automated manufacturing environment. The term industry 4.0 comprises a variety of technologies to enable the development of the value chain resulting in reduced manufacturing lead times, and improved product quality and organizational performance. Industry 4.0 has attracted much attention in the recent literature, however there are very few systematic and extensive review of research that captures the dynamic nature of this topic. The rapidly growing interest from both academics and practitioners in Industry 4.0 has urged the need for review of up-to-date research and development to develop a new agenda. Selected 85 papers were classified in five research categories namely conceptual papers on Industry 4.0, human-machine interactions, machine-equipment interactions, technologies of Industry 4.0 and sustainability. The review primarily attempted to seek answers to the following two questions: (1) What are different research approaches used to study Industry 4.0? and (2) What is the current status of research in the domains of Industry 4.0?. We propose a sustainable Industry 4.0 framework based on the findings of the review with three critical components viz., Industry 4.0 technologies, process integration and sustainable outcomes. Finally, the scope of future research is discussed in detail."}{"Evaluating challenges to Industry 4.0 initiatives for supply chain sustainability in emerging economies ": "Industry 4.0 initiatives can influence whole business system via transforming the means the products are designed, produced, delivered and discarded. Industry 4.0 is relatively novel to developing nations, especially in India and needs a clear definition for proper understanding and practice in business. This paper aims to recognize key challenges to Industry 4.0 initiatives and analyze the identified key challenges to prioritize them for effective Industry 4.0 concepts for supply chain sustainability in emerging economies by taking Indian manufacturing industry perspective. Industry 4.0 initiatives can help industries to incorporate environmental protection and control initiatives as well as process safety measures in supply chains towards sustainable supply chains. However, adoption of Industry 4.0 initiatives is not so easy due to existence of many challenges. Therefore, the present research identifies 18 key challenges to Industry 4.0 initiatives for developing supply chain sustainability using an extensive literature review. These challenges were analyzed through 96 responses received from Indian manufacturing sector using a questionnaire based survey. Explanatory Factor Analysis results classified identified challenges into four key dimensions of challenges. Analytical Hierarchy Process further ranks the identified dimensions of challenges and related challenges. Findings of the study revealed that Organizational challenges holds the highest importance followed by Technological challenges, Strategic challenges, and Legal and ethical issues. This work is very useful for practitioners, policy makers, regulatory bodies and managers to develop an in-depth understanding of Industry 4.0 initiatives and eradicate the potential challenges in adopting Industry 4.0 initiatives for supply chain sustainability."}{"Pharma Industry 4.0: Literature review and research opportunities in sustainable pharmaceutical supply chains ": "The exploitation of the emerging technologies of Pharma Industry 4.0 facilitates sustainable value creation, leads to more agile, smart and personalised pharma industry, and thereby, in the long-run, enables pharma companies to obtain competitive advantages. A more sustainable pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) should be implemented to match future operations and management of the pharmaceutical products across the entire life cycle. The main purpose of this study is to identify the potential sustainability barriers of PSC and to investigate how Industry 4.0 can be applied in the sustainable PSC paradigms. This paper systematically reviews 33 relevant articles concerning sustainable PSC and Industry 4.0, taken from peer-reviewed academic journals over a decade (2008\u20132018). Based on content analysis, we find that the major challenges that inhibit inclusion of sustainability in the PSCs are: high costs and time consumption, little expertise and training, enforcement of regulations, the paucity of business incentives, ineffective collaborations and coordination across the PSC, lack of objective benchmarks, and poor end-customer awareness. The technologies and innovations based on Industry 4.0 can solve these barriers with regards to four aspects: enhancing the flexibility of the PSC for patient-centric drug supplies; improving the effectiveness of coordination and communication across different entities within the PSC; mitigating waste and pollution at different stages; and enabling a more autonomous decision-making process for supply chain managers. Our analysis reveals that future research interest should focus on: cross-linking coordination and cooperation, eco-friendly end-of-life products disposal, proactive product recall management, new benchmarks and measurement of sustainable performance, new regulation system design, and effects of incentives for sustainable activities."}{"Biopotential of compost and compost products derived from horticultural waste\u2014Effect on plant growth and plant pathogens' suppression ": "Besides ecological and environmental benefits of green open spaces, horticultural waste management has various environmental consequences. Green waste composting represents promising environmentally friendly alternative which gives valuable products with positive soil and plants impact. Composting products\u2019 quality determinates their application and depends on the particular waste material and process parameters. The aim of this paper was to estimate the chemical and microbiological quality of green waste compost and compost products (compost tea, compost extract and the solid phase after extraction), and their biopotential based on germination rate, germination index and inhibition of phytopathogenic fungi growth. Higher germination rate of examined plant seeds was noticed on the solid phase after extraction, and compost extract, compared to compost, and compost tea, respectively. Plants with low germination rate grown on compost showed higher fresh and dry biomass. Compost products strongly inhibited the growth of plant pathogens Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia sp., and Pythium debaryanum. Presented results show that composted biodegradable waste from urban green spaces contribute to the plant growth and phytopathogenic fungi suppression, and thus improve the overall environmental quality."}{"Industry 4.0 implementation for multinationals ": "Delivering on digitalization for large multinational business, in the contemporary context of global operations and real time delivery, is a significant opportunity. Operations of localised facilities independent of global operations can result in compromised global synergies. Centralised functions such as research and development, optimisations of assets, corporate planning (strategy, investment planning, financial), and supply chain together with any other function deliver significant business value. Integration of these functions via industry 4.0 delivers significant business value, delivering strategic and operational benefits. This research proposes a global system approach, as defined by industry 4.0 (vertical, horizontal and total business integration), to this challenge, from ERP through manufacturing systems down to instrumentation. The proposed work resolves the inter-site challenges together with global standardization and inter-functional integration. This proposed architecture is reinforced by a simulation illustrating the benefits of the integrated business."}{"Assessing challenges for implementing Industry 4.0: Implications for process safety and environmental protection ": "Researchers and practitioners are giving significant attention to Industry 4.0 due to its numerous benefits to manufacturing organizations. Several aspects of Industry 4.0 have been studied in the literature. However, studies on the challenges for implementing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing operations have received less attention. To address this gap, this study identifies a set of challenges (framework) for implementing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing industries. This framework is evaluated in the leather industry of Bangladesh aided by a novel multi-criteria decision-making method named Best-Worst method (BWM). The findings of the study showed that \u2018lack of technological infrastructure\u2019 is the most pressing challenge that may hurdle the implementation of Industry 4.0 whereas \u2018environmental side-effects\u2019 is the less among the challenges that may hinder implementation of Industry 4.0 in the Bangladeshi leather industry. This result may help decision makers, industrial managers and practitioners in the Bangladeshi leather industry to realize the actual challenges confronting them when attempting to implement Industry 4.0 and focus their attention on how to address these challenges to pave ways for a successful implementation of Industry 4.0."}{"Industry 4.0 as enabler for a sustainable development: A qualitative assessment of its ecological and social potential ": "In 2015, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Agenda 2030 which counts 17 indivisible and self-sustaining goals. These so-called Sustainable Development Goals are intended to serve as a foundation for a transformation of the global economies towards a sustainable development. This transformation process should be built on an economic development in accordance with social equality and within ecological boundaries. As essential stakeholders for a global sustainable development, industrial organizations have to shift towards a novel paradigm which puts an emphasis on sustainable value creation. Industrial value creation has gone through radical changes during the last years. Since the 2010s, the so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) can be observed. The state of the art in research and technology for Industry 4.0 and sustainability is outlined. The potential for sustainable value creation in Industry 4.0 is qualitatively assessed for a macro and micro perspective based on a literature review and expert interviews. The assessment unfolds that the value creation might positively contribute to a sustainable development in many cases. Critical areas with expected negative contributions related to the quantity of materials used, primary energy consumption, and working conditions are identified and elaborated in more detail. A demonstrator for an intelligent cube production is investigated in order to verify the results of the assessment. This demonstrator is currently set up in China as part of a Sino-German Research Institute."}{"Ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-scheme H2-production photocatalyst ": "The appropriate interfacial contact of heterojunction photocatalysts plays a critical role in transfer/separation of interfacial charge carriers. Design of two-dimensional (2D)/2D surface-to-surface heterojunction is an effective method for improving photocatalytic activity since greater contact area can enhance interfacial charge transfer rate. Herein, ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-like composite heterojunction photocatalysts were fabricated by electrostatic self-assembly of ultrathin tungsten trioxide (WO3) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets. The ultrathin WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets were obtained by electrostatic-assisted ultrasonic exfoliation of bulk WO3 and a two-step thermal-etching of bulk g-C3N4, respectively. The thickness of ultrathin WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets are 2.5\u20133.5\u2009nm, which is equivalent to 5\u20138 atomic or molecular layer thickness. This ultrathin layered heterojunction structure can enhance surface photocatalytic rate because photogenerated electrons and holes at heterogeneous interface more easily transfer to surface of photocatalysts. Therefore, the obtained ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited better H2-production activity than pure g-C3N4 and WO3 with the same loading amount of Pt as cocatalyst. The mechanism and driving force of charge transfer and separation in S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are investigated and discussed. This investigation will provide new insight about designing and constructing novel S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts."}{"CO oxidation by Pd supported on CeO2(100) and CeO2(111) facets ": "Pd/CeO2 is an active component in emission control catalysts for CO oxidation. Nanostructured CeO2 powders can be prepared in the form of rods exposing predominantly (111) surfaces and cubes exposing (100) surfaces. While differences in the reactivity of Pd supported on these facets of ceria have been reported, the origins of the reactivity differences are not well understood. Pd supported on (111) surfaces of ceria rods exhibits room-temperature CO oxidation activity, while Pd on (100) surface of ceria cubes shows comparable activity at a temperature that is 60\u2009\u00b0C higher. Earlier, we established that Pd/CeO2-rods are active due to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism involving isolated Pd atoms in the form of Pd1O and Pd1O2 species. Here, we establish using in situ CO IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) that, in addition to TEM-visible Pd nanoparticles, Pd/CeO2-cubes also contain isolated Pd species, predominantly in the form of Pd1O. DFT calculations show that CO oxidation proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen pathway, which is possible for the (100) surface because of the lower Ce-O binding energy compared to the (111) surface. Overall, the catalytic cycle for CO oxidation on Pd/CeO2(100) involves a higher free energy barrier than on Pd/CeO2(111) in keeping with the experimentally observed activity difference. EXAFS measurements show that the active Pd phase in both Pd/CeO2-rods and Pd/CeO2-cubes responds dynamically with respect to reducing and oxidizing conditions. The redispersion of Pd in oxidative conditions is more pronounced for Pd/CeO2-rods and the catalyst is more active after an oxidative treatment."}{"Direct Z-scheme ZnO/CdS hierarchical photocatalyst for enhanced photocatalytic H2-production activity ": "Herein, ZnO/CdS hierarchical composite was prepared through a hydrothermal and chemical bath deposition (CBD) process. Its photocatalytic H2-production performance was tested. Mass ratio of CdS acted a pivotal part in light absorption and photocatalytic properties. Noticeably, promoted photocatalytic H2-production activity of 4134\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009g\u22121\u2009h-1 was achieved by the sample with optimal CdS content. Significantly, the photoluminescence (PL) detection of hydroxyl radicals, as well as the in-situ XPS measurements was selected to verify the direct Z-scheme charge migration mechanism. This mechanism endowed the composite with strong capability for hydrogen evolution and elucidated the improved photocatalytic performance. The improvement of photocatalytic activity was due to hierarchical structure, extended visible light response and direct Z-scheme mechanism. This work will give an innovative vision in constructing direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system with great photocatalytic H2-production activity."}{"A review of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in the indoor environment: occurrence in consumer products, indoor air and dust ": "As many people spend a large part of their life indoors, the quality of the indoor environment is important. Data on contaminants such as flame retardants, pesticides and plasticizers are available for indoor air and dust but are scarce for consumer products such as computers, televisions, furniture, carpets, etc.\n                  This review presents information on semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in consumer products in an attempt to link the information available for chemicals in indoor air and dust with their indoor sources. A number of 256 papers were selected and divided among SVOCs found in consumer products (n\u202f=\u202f57), indoor dust (n\u202f=\u202f104) and air (n\u202f=\u202f95). Concentrations of SVOCs in consumer products, indoor dust and air are reported (e.g. PFASs max: 13.9\u202f\u03bcg/g in textiles, 5.8\u202f\u03bcg/kg in building materials, 121\u202fng/g in house dust and 6.4\u202fng/m3 in indoor air). Most of the studies show common aims, such as human exposure and risk assessment. The main micro-environments investigated (houses, offices and schools) reflect the relevance of indoor air quality. Most of the studies show a lack of data on concentrations of chemicals in consumer goods and often only the presence of chemicals is reported. At the moment this is the largest obstacle linking chemicals in products to chemicals detected in indoor air and dust."}{"Sorption of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) to an organic soil horizon \u2013 Effect of cation composition and pH ": "Accurate prediction of the sorption of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in soils is essential for environmental risk assessment. We investigated the effect of solution pH and calculated soil organic matter (SOM) net charge on the sorption of 14 PFASs onto an organic soil as a function of pH and added concentrations of Al3+, Ca2+ and Na+. Often, the organic C-normalized partitioning coefficients (K\n                     \n                        OC\n                     ) showed a negative relationship to both pH (\u0394log K\n                     \n                        OC\n                     /\u0394pH\u202f=\u202f\u22120.32\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.11 log units) and the SOM bulk net negative charge (\u0394log K\n                     \n                        OC\n                     \u202f=\u202f\u22121.41\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.40 per log unit molc g\u22121). Moreover, perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs) sorbed more strongly than perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and the PFAS sorption increased with increasing perfluorocarbon chain length with 0.60 and 0.83 log K\n                     \n                        OC\n                      units per CF2 moiety for C3\u2013C10 PFCAs and C4, C6, and C8 PFSAs, respectively. The effects of cation treatment and SOM bulk net charge were evident for many PFASs with low to moderate sorption (C5\u2013C8 PFCAs and C6 PFSA). However for the most strongly sorbing and most long-chained PFASs (C9\u2013C11 and C13 PFCAs, C8 PFSA and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA)), smaller effects of cations were seen, and instead sorption was more strongly related to the pH value. This suggests that the most long-chained PFASs, similar to other hydrophobic organic compounds, are preferentially sorbed to the highly condensed domains of the humin fraction, while shorter-chained PFASs are bound to a larger extent to humic and fulvic acid, where cation effects are significant."}{"Zinc and iron oxide nanoparticles improved the plant growth and reduced the oxidative stress and cadmium concentration in wheat ": "The effects of seed priming with zinc oxide (ZnO) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles (NPs) on the growth and cadmium (Cd) accumulation by wheat (Triticum aestivum) were investigated. Seeds of wheat were primed with different concentrations of either ZnO NPs (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121) or Fe NPs (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121) for 24\u202fh by continuous aeration and then the seeds were sown in a soil which was contaminated with Cd due to long-term application of sewage water. Plants were grown till maturity under natural conditions with 60\u201370% moisture contents of total soil water holding capacity throughout the experiment. Plant height, spike length, and dry weights of shoots, roots, spikes, and grains were increased with NPs, in particular with the higher rates of NPs. The results depicted that NPs positively affected the photosynthesis of wheat as compared to the control. The NPs reduced the electrolyte leakage and superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities in leaves of Cd-stressed wheat. The concentrations of Cd in roots, shoots, and grains were significantly decreased with NPs application. The Cd content in the grains was below the threshold level of Cd (0.2\u202fmg\u202fkg\u22121) for cereals when the seeds were treated with higher NPs treatments. The application of ZnO NPs increased the Zn concentrations and Fe NPs increased the Fe concentrations in roots, shoots, and grains. Overall, the NPs play a major role in the increase in biomass, nutrients and decrease in Cd toxicity in wheat."}{"The PFOA substitute GenX detected in the environment near a fluoropolymer manufacturing plant in the Netherlands ": "The ban on perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has led to the production and use of alternative fluorinated compounds such as GenX. Limited information is available on the occurrence of this PFOA substitute. In this pilot study, we investigated the presence of GenX in/on grass and leaf samples collected near a fluoropolymer manufacturing plant in the Netherlands and in drinking water produced from surface and surface-water influenced groundwater intake points within 25\u202fkm from the plant. GenX was detected in/on all grass and leaf samples collected within 3\u202fkm north-east from the plant, with levels ranging from 1 to 27\u202fng/g wet weight (ww) and 4.3\u201386\u202fng/g ww, respectively. The PFOA levels in/on grass and leaves were lower, ranging from 0.7 to 11\u202fng/g ww and 0.9\u201328\u202fng/g ww, respectively. A declining concentration gradient of GenX and PFOA with increasing distance from the plant was observed, which suggests that the plant is a point source of GenX and was a point source for PFOA in the past. In all drinking water samples, GenX and PFOA were detected with levels ranging from 1.4 to 8.0\u202fng/L and 1.9\u20137.1\u202fng/L, respectively. The detection of GenX, which is only used since 2012, in/on grass and leaves and in drinking water indicates that GenX is now distributed through the environment. The presence of GenX and PFOA in/on grass and leaves within 3\u202fkm north-east of the plant also suggests that these chemicals could also be present on the locally grown food in gardens around the factory."}{"Water-stable metal-organic frameworks for aqueous removal of heavy metals and radionuclides: A review ": "Heavy metals and radionuclides in water are a global environmental issue, which has been receiving considerable attention worldwide. Water-stable MOFs are green and recyclable materials to eliminate the environmental impacts caused by the hazardous heavy metal ions and radionuclides in water. This paper presents a systematical review on the current status of water-stable MOFs that capture and convert a wide range of heavy metal ions (e.g., As(III)/As(V), Pb(II), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Cr(III)/Cr(VI)) and radionuclides (e.g., U(VI), Se(IV)/Se(VI) and Cs(I)) in aqueous solution. Water-stable MOFs and MOF-based composites exhibit the superior adsorption capability for these metal species in water. Significantly, MOFs show high selectivity in capturing target metal ions even in the presence of multiple water constituents. Mechanisms involved in capturing metal ions are described. MOFs also have excellent catalytic performance (photocatalysis and catalytic reduction by formic acid) for Cr(VI) conversion to Cr(III). Future research is suggested to provide insightful guidance to enhance the performance of the MOFs in capturing target pollutants in aquatic environment."}{"A new cost effective, long life and low resistance filter cartridge for water treatment ": "Filtration processes constitute the major solution among water treatments, which appear always necessary nowadays to make water suitable for human consumption or domestic uses, due to the gradual deterioration of its quality as a consequence of environmental pollution and industrial processes. In this paper a new type of filtering cartridge is presented, aimed at overcoming the main inconveniences shown by usual commercial cartridges. These drawbacks have been highlighted in a previous experimental work conducted in the Laboratory of Environmental and Maritime Hydraulics (LIDAM) of University of Salerno and aimed at evaluating the head losses produced by the most common filtration cartridges, especially under progressive clog conditions. Head losses, in fact, are particularly undesirable for low-pressure plants, where they can inhibit the normal operation of the installed apparatus. The analysis of the experimental results permitted to reveal several features of the filtration process in commercial cartridges and draw up different remarks, which led, after further laboratory tests here presented, to the design of a new economic, non-toxic, low-resistance and long life-cycle filtration cartridge, proposed and described in this paper. This cartridge, is basically made of a central element in inert cotton wrapped in a cylindrical polypropylene support, similar to the commercial one but with the core protected by elements, such as white marble pebbles, effective microorganism ceramic cylinders and granular active coal, which, while ensuring a good hydraulic permeability, is capable of stopping much of the particles suspended in the fluid before they reach the cartridge causing its clogging. The new design permits, therefore, to significantly reduce, compared with the commercial cartridges, average head losses even for high clogging degrees, and to increase, as a consequence, the life cycle of the cartridges."}{"Water quality remediation using aquaponics sub-systems as biological and mechanical filters in aquaculture ": "This paper presents data obtained through trials on small-scale aquaponics sub-system which performs the roles of biological and mechanical filters for aquaculture water quality remediation. Aquaponics is a bio-integrated food production system, consisting of closed recirculating aquaculture combined with hydroponics. The trials were conducted on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and the Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa chinensis) over a period of 70\u202fdays. The results revealed that the system is more efficient in terms of plant growth and does not adversely affect the growth of captive stock of fish. Mean (\u00b1\u202fS.D.) values of water temperature, DO, pH, NH3-N, NO2-N, NO3-N and PO4-P during the trial were 25.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25\u202f\u00b0C, 6.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13\u202fmg/L, 7.14\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.06, 0.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02\u202fmg/L, 0.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.22\u202fmg/L, 0.89\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.37\u202fmg/L and 0.45\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202fmg/L, respectively. The average total weight gain by O. niloticus was 637.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.49\u202fg, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 1.47\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.01 which indicated the efficiency of Nile tilapia in converting feed mass \u2013 a universally standard measure of efficiency of feed assimilation into weight gain, especially when there is no additional source of nourishment. High survival rate (95\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8%) was noticed during the trials. The average (\u00b1SD) values of biomass gain by P. vulgaris and B. rapa were 951.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6\u202fg and 85.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.4\u202fg, respectively. The system was cost-effective and efficient in purging the toxic waste from water, resulting in remediation of water quality for the recirculating aquaculture system. This reflected the effectiveness of biofiltration which is currently assessed by its ability to completely remove the ammonia and minimize the generation of nitrite."}{"Membrane bioreactor and integrated membrane bioreactor systems for micropollutant removal from wastewater: A review ": "Over the last few decades, the presence of micropollutants in the wastewater stream is imposing a serious concern worldwide. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology has been widely employed for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with micropollutants. Hence, the aim of this paper is to provide a consolidate review on the present state of research and advancement in MBR technology along with its augmentation with other wastewater treatment technologies for micropollutant removal, sustainability, and operating cost assessment for its feasibility. The potential application of MBR and hybrid-MBR systems in micropollutant removal along with the fate, removal mechanism, various factors affecting the MBR system efficiency and the operational cost involved were also been discussed in detail. Further, based on the available technologies on MBR, the authors discussed the future research perspective for micropollutant removal from the effluent stream with an objective of the circular economy."}{"Phosphorus reduction in filters for on-site wastewater treatment ": "Discharges of phosphorus (P) from on-site wastewater treatment systems generally contribute to eutrophication problems in Swedish freshwaters and, ultimately, in the Baltic Sea. Such concerns have led to a growing interest in improving P removal in treatment facilities. This study investigated the reduction of P in 12 full-scale on-site treatment systems featuring sand filters and alkaline P-filters by sampling and analysing filter influents and effluents. The flow-proportional samples collected were analysed for total and dissolved P, BOD7, total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC), and pH. Seven of the eight investigated sand filters did not provide satisfactory total P reduction; the likely explanations are filter clogging and wastewater dilution by extraneous water. In addition, effluents from four of the eight sand filters had total P concentrations higher than 3\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121, which is the Swedish effluent limit recommended for common receiving waters, indicating that a subsequent polishing step would be needed. Six of the nine investigated P-filters reduced P adequately, with total P concentrations in the effluent ranging between 0.1 and 1.9\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121. The three underperforming P-filters had effluent pH values below 9; filter age, clogging, and hydraulic overload were identified as probable reasons for their poor performance. A statistically significant correlation was found between total-P reduction and filtrate pH, but no significant correlation was detected between organic load in the influent and P reduction by the P-filters. The P-filter media replacement frequency could not be established, but filtrate pH appeared to be a good estimator."}{"Water treatment chemicals: Trends and challenges ": "The addition of water treatment chemicals has always been considered as a standard operation in water and wastewater treatment. The concentration of chemicals was usually kept to the minimum necessary to achieve a good quality of potable or otherwise treated water. A significant interruption to the status-quo occurred more than 20 years ago after a severe and highly publicized outbreak of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. The strategic planning after the outbreak was to shift from physical-chemical to physical treatment methods, such as membrane filtration and UV disinfection. As such, the new procedures were supposed to eliminate the threat of water contamination through a minor addition of chemicals. Such was the mistrust and disappointment with water treatment chemicals themselves.\n                  Indeed, water treatment technologies are now using novel physical treatment methods. Membranes largely replaced granular filtration, and UV is paving the way towards minimization or elimination of the use of classic disinfection chemicals, such as chlorine and its derivatives. Yet, far from the \u201chigh-tech\u201d revolution in water treatment technologies actually reducing the use of chemicals, the latter has in fact been significantly increased. The \u201cconventional\u201d chemicals used for pre-treatment, disinfection, corrosion prevention, softening and algae bloom depression are all still in place. Furthermore, new groups of chemicals such as biocides, chelating agents and fouling cleaners are currently used to supplement them. These latter are the chemicals needed to protect the high-tech equipment, to optimize the treatment, and to clean the equipment between uses.\n                  The health effects of the new chemicals introduced into water are yet to be fully established. Typically, a higher treatment efficiency requires effective chemicals, yet these are not always environmentally friendly. It seems obvious that the \u201chigh-tech\u201d revolution currently affects the sustainability of water resources, and certainly not in a completely positive way. In short, the adverse effects of the introduction of such a significant amount of treatment chemicals into our sources of water are yet to be evaluated."}{"Revisiting of coagulation-flocculation processes in the production of potable water ": "Water Treatment Plants treat \"flushy\" raw waters and the majority use electrolytes and polyelectrolytes for the removal of the solid and organic impurities included in surface waters. The dose of the used reagents depend strongly on the nature of the incoming surface water and its turbidity. Turbidity is due to the suspended particles in the source water and up to date is main criterion for the appropriate choice of the electrolyte and polyelectrolyte nature and dosage. One of the main findings of the present work is that the selection of the appropriate dose of coagulants and flocculants as a linear function of turbidity is not right, especially for the large values of turbidity. The most common electrolytes Aluminum sulfate and PolyAluminiumChloride together with the polyelectrolyte PolyAcrylaMide, are tested for their effectiveness in the removal of suspended particles and their results discussed based on the particle\u2019s \u03b6-potential and size distribution. These common reagents have raised public health concerns due to the residual aluminium and acrylamide which remain in treated water and at produced sludge. Thus, the present work examined and suggests the use of polymers as the natural Chitosan and CMInulin and the synthetic PolyDiallylDiMethylAmmoniumChloride, as alternative, environmentally friendly coagulants, for their performance on the treatment of potable water. The new reagents proved to reduce the turbidity of the surface water up to 96%."}{"Development and efficacy analysis of a Moringa oleifera based potable water purification kit ": "The purpose of this study was to develop a water purification kit using seeds of Moringa oleifera (MO). For this purpose, aqueous extract of MO seeds was investigated for antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacterial strains viz. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). It was determined that 100\u2009mg/mL of extract of MO seeds was effective against these bacterial strains resulting in 28.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.707\u2009mm of inhibition zone against E. coli, 26.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.707\u2009mm against S. aureus, 26.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u2009mm against S. typhi, 29.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.707\u2009mm against P. aeruginosa and 25.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.707\u2009mm against MRSA. MIC (Minimum inhibitory concentration) of 12.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u2009mg/mL against E. coli and 6.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u2009mg/mL against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. typhi, and MRSA was obtained. Accordingly, portable water purification kit in the form of a dip bag enclosing extremely safe and edible MO seed powder was developed as a key to drinking water problem. Water purification was performed using dip bag to treat pathogenic strains inoculated in water. The minimum time and seed quantity required for the anti-bacterial activity of seeds was optimized and was noted that a single dip bag containing 100\u2009mg of MO seed powder was capable of eradicating 99.9% of the microbial load from 1\u2009L of water in a time span of 5\u2009min. Drinking water from natural water resources containing coliform bacteria was also tested using dip bag and was found to be equally effective."}{"Sugarcane vinasse processing: Toward a status shift from waste to valuable resource. A review ": "The foreseeable increase of bioethanol production by distilleries will inevitably lead to an important increase in production of the associated effluent, namely vinasse. Due to its high pollution load, characterized by high chemical oxygen demand, high salt content and heavy dark color, the depollution of this effluent is mandatory before release into nature. In this work, we reviewed the literature on the main physicochemical and biological treatments of sugarcane vinasse and emphasised on the technological valuation of vinasse that allows to shift the status of the effluent from waste to valuable resource. The membrane systems seem to offer the best depollution option but they are subjected to strong technical limitations. Several alternative processes have been proposed, but they generally fail to treat the entire organic load of waste when used in stand-alone technology, while generating higher investment costs in the treatment process. The biological processes turn out to be particularly promising as they are able to produce interesting metabolites from living cells. Among them, production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is by far the most developed and economically viable process for treatment of vinasse. However a few works, also using vinasse as a growth medium, have been published on development of innovative technics to produce single cell products such as lipids, proteins, organic acids, alcohols or enzymes. In the medium term, technologies to produce third generation biodiesel are developing to complement and compete with fuels derived from petroleum. Finally, the development of hydrogen production processes from vinasse is emerging, thus preparing us for a long-term decarbonised economy."}{"A case study of nonlinear programming approach for repeated testing of HIV in a population stratified by subpopulations according to different risks of new infections ": "Motivated by the vision of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS that 90% of people living with HIV will be diagnosed by year 2020, we present an optimization framework regarding repeated testing of an infectious disease which is transmitted unevenly in the population. A subset of HIV surveillance data in Canada with detailed and compatible variables is pooled for statistical analysis. The study population is Men having Sex with Men (MSM) in Canada from the pooled data. Estimated parameters regarding the HIV epidemic in the study population show that, across age strata, the number of new infections is distributed differently from the number of people living with HIV. A nonlinear programming algorithm is developed regarding which strata should be considered for repeated testing. Among strata in which repeated testing is considered, the optimal frequency of testing is calculated by stratum to minimize the expected number of tests per year. Scenarios and options that all fulfil the UNAIDS vision are presented. In addition to minimizing the expected number of tests per year, other considerations are also examined such as annual testing in selected strata and the tolerance to imperfect implementation of the testing program with low coverage or uptake rates."}{"Emerging contaminants: Here today, there tomorrow! ": "The subject of emerging contaminants has attracted wide attention from researchers and society world over due to their emerging as well as potential adverse impacts on the environment. Many attempts have been made to shed light on the importance of the release of these contaminants into various environments and further urge policymakers to take required measures. Nevertheless, the effective long-term strategy for addressing this issue is latent in the modification of current technologies of wastewater/water treatment plants and integrating them into a holistic and circular water management system. The research on the new technologies of water treatment must be realigned to consider the real conditions and meet certain requirements set according to technical and environmental perspectives."}{"Organophosphorus pesticides residues in food and their colorimetric detection ": "Pesticides are enormously used to control the pests in agriculture, industry and human premises. Agricultural production has been significantly increased with the help of pesticides but their uncontrolled and excessive use is polluting the environment, food, water and agricultural products. Presence of pesticides residues in food products and human milk is the alarming sign to set up stringent monitoring system and eradication remedies. Many advancements have been happened in recent years for the detection and quantification different pesticides in the various matrices. The present review article specifically focuses on the detection techniques for the organophosphorus pesticides. Organophosphorus pesticides are now a days hugely applied in agriculture after ban on many organochlorine pesticides and hence creating health complications. Visual or colorimetric detection of the pesticides using different nanostructures is considerably exploited for the onsite monitoring of organophosphorus pesticides. These advancements in pesticides detection are presented in detail along with brief overview of pesticides removal methodologies."}{"Accumulation of organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticide residues in fish, water, and sediments in the Thamirabarani river system of southern peninsular India ": "This study was undertaken to investigate the bioaccumulation of organochlorine (OCPs) and pyrethroids pesticides in surface water, sediments, fish, and aquatic weeds of the Thamirabarani river system, southern India. Samples were collected from five sampling sites, viz, Manimuthar, Tirunelveli, Srivaikuntam, Authoor, and Punnakayal, and tested for OCPs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) following QuEChERS extraction procedure. OCPs detected in surface waters ranged from 0.001 to 34.44\u2009\u03bcgl\u22121; sediments from 0.01 to 16.72\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121; fish muscle from 0.01 to 26.05\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121; gills from 0.01 to 40.56\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121; liver from 0.01 to 65.14\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121 and aquatic weeds from 0.01 to 5.53\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121. Endosulfan, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin and heptachlor were the dominant OCPs found above the maximum residue limits set by World Health Organisation for surface waters. Sediments also contained relatively high amounts of endosulfan, aldrin, dieldrin, and endrin. Species - specific bioaccumulation of OCPs in fish muscle tissue was noticed. Rohu contained more endosulfan than catla and tilapia. Concentration of OCPs in the liver was much higher than that in the gills and muscles. Methoxychlor was one of the predominant OCPs in the fish liver. A positive correlation existed between fat content and bioaccumulation of OCPs in fish muscle. Aquatic weeds in the river did not have significant levels of OCPs. Presence of relatively high levels of OCPs in upstream waters is therefore a serious concern and hence suitable measures need to be taken up by regulatory authorities."}{"Response surface optimization of hydrothermal synthesis of Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles under supercritical water conditions: Application for photocatalytic degradation of Tetracycline ": "Ultrafine bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) powders have been successfully synthesized through supercritical water hydrothermal technique, in a batch type reactor. A Box\u2013Behnken three-level experimental design was used to optimize the process variables affecting the BiFeO3 efficiency includes pH of starting solution (1.5\u201312.5), reaction time (1\u20132\u2009h), and reaction temperature (450\u2013550 \u2103). The samples were characterized via X\u2013ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The model was validated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and conducting an experiment at optimal design conditions (temperature of 522 \u2103, pH of 3.25 and 1.3\u2009h). The maximum BiFeO3 production efficiency which obtained at optimum condition was about 45%. The attained results showed good correlation between the predicted model and experimental data (Model P-Value\u2009=\u20090.0052). The present work confirmed that the supercritical water hydrothermal method is a suitable way to produce BiFeO3 nanoparticles with a mean grain size of 60\u2009nm and narrow size distribution. Moreover, the optical property of the product was investigated by Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The attained nanostructures showed a narrow band gap of 1.96\u2009eV, indicating that BiFeO3 powders can be applied as a novel visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for degradation of tetracycline (TC). Photocatalytic experiments revealed that using BiFeO3 nanoparticles, TC degradation efficiency of 80.3% and 87.5% could be reached under UV and visible light radiations, respectively. Furthermore, it was found the degradation of TC follows the pseudo-second-order kinetics by BiFeO3."}{"Fabrication of polyacrylonitrile/\u03b2-cyclodextrin/graphene oxide nanofibers composite as an efficient adsorbent for cationic dye ": "This research reported fabrication of hybrid Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/ \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD)/graphene oxide (GO) composite nanofibers materials using the electrospinning technique. The PAN/\u03b2-CD/GO nanofibers were electrospun using a different concentrations of GO (1.0\u20135.0 %) depend of the total weight of PAN/\u03b2-CD. Subsequently, the PAN/\u03b2-CD/GO nanofibers were characterized by SEM, an optical microscope (OM), XRD, FTIR, TGA, and Raman. Results indicated that various properties of nanofibers were modified upon the addition of different concentrations of GO. The resulted hybrid nanofibers were employed as a membrane for dye removal from aqueous media. The adsorption activity of PAN/\u03b2-CD/GO composite nanofibers at different GO concentrations was examined by using crystal violet (CV) as model dye molecules. Results obtained demonstrated that the adsorption process was affected by the concentration of the GO. In addition, the equilibrium and adsorption kinetic behaviors of dye sorption onto the nanofibers were found to conform to a pseudo-second-order kinetics."}{"A new synthesis of Cu2O spherical particles for the degradation of methylene blue dye ": "In this paper, cuprous oxide nanoparticles (Cu2ONPs) were synthesized using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent and Origanum vulgare leaf extract as an oxidizing agent. The experimental reaction was conducted at room temperature. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Cu2ONPs was evaluated in the presence of methylene blue (MB) dye. The nanoparticles were characterized using Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The UV\u2013vis spectra exhibit surface plasm\u00f3n resonance bands that confirm the presence of Cu2ONPs. The XRD reflections of the obtained solids were indexed according to the cubic structure of Cu2O. SEM and TEM analysis reveal particles with a spherical morphology ranging in size from 60 to 120\u2009nm with an average size of 90\u2009nm. The experimental results showed that the Cu2ONPs are a useful material for the degradation of MB dye after 80\u2009min in the absence of any catalyzer (i.e.NaBH4) during reaction."}{"Kinetics and simulation of nitrification at various pH values of a polluted river in the tropics ": "Nitrification is simulated in existing water quality models by multiplying the rate with the attenuation factors for water temperature and dissolved oxygen. The effect of pH, substrates and bacteria is mostly neglected. Moreover, the two-step nitrification is simplified to a one-step process. The aim of this study is to investigate the kinetics of two-step nitrification and to simulate this process. Consequently, the importance of considering the effect of pH, substrate and bacteria in nitrification modelling of river basins is emphasized. For this, an experiment was performed on water taken from the Tay Ninh River in Vietnam. The results show a low actual ammonium oxidation rate in the water column of the river. The ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at pH 5 while the nitrite oxidation is strongly inhibited at pH 8.5. In comparison to the ammonium oxidizers (AOB), the nitrite oxidizers (NOB) are rarely inhibited at low pH. Numerical simulation of the experiment delivered ammonium oxidation rates kA\n                      and nitrite oxidation rates kN\n                      for different pH values. The kA\n                      for pH values lower than 6 is very low. It increases rapidly as the pH increases from 6 to 6.5. We also found out that pH values of 7.5 and 7 are optimal for the activity of AOB and NOB, respectively. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the effect of pH, substrate and bacteria on the nitrification research in river basins. In doing so, nitrification can be simulated more realistically and sustainable water management can be carried out more successfully."}{"Ecological conditions and ecosystem services of wetlands in the Lake Tana Area, Ethiopia ": "Although wetlands are known to provide vital ecosystem services, the current state of wetlands in Ethiopia in terms of their ecosystem service components remains poorly understood. Wetlands located in the UNESCO Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve have been highly degraded, but possess highly valuable resources. Therefore, this study sought to assess the major ecological states and identify the main ecosystem services (ESs), along with local people's perceptions of wetland management. Nine wetlands were selected from pristine/reference, agricultural and urban land uses of the Lake Tana area. Numerous ESs were identified, categorized into four main ecosystem services, analyzed using a conceptual model adopted for this purpose, and their ecological conditions were assessed using a range of methods. The results revealed that the provisioning and cultural services were found to surpass the regulatory and supporting services of wetlands in agricultural and urban types, as compared to wetlands located in pristine areas. Although most of the local residents positively viewed wetland regulation and supporting services, weak policy and decision support such as wetland use planning, investment interventions and communal land ownership, and poor development of diversified livelihood were found to pose major challenges to sustainable utilization of wetland resources. The range of plant species diversity among the impaired wetlands was observed to be related to the degree of disturbance, with urban and agricultural wetlands being highly degraded as compared to pristine wetlands. Moreover, these impaired wetlands were found to be invaded by upland and exotic weeds, out-competing the socioeconomically and ecologically important native species."}{"Regional scale hydrologic modeling for prediction of water balance, analysis of trends in streamflow and variations in streamflow: The case study of the Ganga River basin ": "Study region\n                  Ganga River basin.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  The availability of freshwater has been recognized as a global issue, and the reliable evaluation and quantification of it within the basin is necessary to bolster the sustainable management of water. For this purpose a basin-scale SWAT model of the Ganga River basin has been developed.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrologic insights for the region\n                  Model validation showed that simulated results were consistent with the observed data in reproducing the seasonal dynamics of surface water and suggest that the model is capable of reproducing the hydrological features of the basin including the snow melt. However, there are large variations in both temporal and spatial distribution of the hydrological components. Statistical methods have been used for detecting trends and critical changes in streamflow. It has been found that although the streamflow from the snow fed areas has increased, the stream flow in the lower reaches and the non-perennial tributaries have declined significantly. This decline can be attributed to both anthropogenic and exogenous changes. The study also establishes that there has been a substantial reduction in overall water resources availability with respect to Virgin. This information sets the yardstick to the restoration of the hydrological and environmental health of the basin and can lead to better management of water resources under scarcity."}{"Transboundary aquifers of Africa: Review of the current state of knowledge and progress towards sustainable development and management ": "Study region\n                  Transboundary aquifers (TBAs) of Africa.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  Review of work on TBAs in Africa, including an overview of assessments and management efforts that have taken place over the last half century.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights\n                  Seventy-two TBAs have been mapped in Africa. They underlie 40% of the continent, where 33% of the population lives, often in arid or semi-arid regions. TBA inventories have progressed since 2000 and remain work in progress. Despite their importance only eleven TBAs have been subjected to more detailed studies. Cooperation has been formalised for seven TBAs. Most of these TBAs are in North Africa and the Sahel. The recent global Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme compiled information at the national level to describe TBAs in terms of key indicators related to the water resource, socio-economic, and legal and institutional conditions. Availability of data at national level is low, hampering regional assessment. Comparing indicators, from questionnaire surveys, with those from a global water-use model showed variable levels of agreement, calling for further research. Reports on agreements scoping TBA management, indicate that this may be dealt with within international river/lake agreements, but reported inconsistencies between TBA sharing countries also indicate that implementation is limited. Increasing awareness and support to joint TBA management is noticeable amongst international organisations. However, such cooperation requires long-term commitment to produce impacts at the local level."}{"The insider threat: Behavioral indicators and factors influencing likelihood of intervention ": "The insider threat is a significant security concern for Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) organizations. A successful insider act in one of the CNI sectors has potential to damage assets and interrupt the critical services that society depends upon. Existing research suggests that behavioral indicators are often evident prior to an act taking place, but that reporting of such behaviors does not usually happen. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence employees\u2019 intention to intervene when observing behavioral changes associated with insider acts. An online survey with employees within a large Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) energy sector organization (N\u202f=\u202f55) explored factors including behavioral change type, relationship to the actor, employment status of the actor and actor motivations. Results supported existing research regarding reluctance to report behavioral indicators of attitude change, but also demonstrated that situations with sufficient evidence are more likely to be reported. Factors which inhibited intervention likelihood were relative seniority and perceived motivations of the actor, confidence of confidentiality and clarity of reporting processes. Primary barriers to intervention related to the observer's perceived ability to correctly interpret behavioral indicators and awareness of how to respond. Organizations need to provide training regarding behavioral indictors of insider threats, clear, confidential reporting processes, and a culture where respectful challenge is encouraged."}{"Regulated applications for the road transportation infrastructure: The case study of the smart tachograph in the European Union ": "The Digital Tachograph (DT) is an equipment intended for installation in road commercial vehicles to display, record, print, store and output automatically or semi-automatically details of the vehicle movement and details of certain periods of activity of the drivers. It is used in the European Union to check the driving times of drivers and enforce the legislation on social rules (rest period, driving time limits), in relation with the road safety objective of reducing the number of accidents and fatalities in the EU. Each driver is equipped with a personal card (s)he has to introduce in the tachograph to be personally identified. The DT is a very important application in Europe in the road transportation sector as it is obligatory to install a DT in commercial vehicles having a mass of more than 3,5 tonnes (in goods transport) and carrying more than 9 persons including the driver (in passenger transport). Thus this regulation impacts millions of vehicles. The legal and technical framework has been recently revised according to Council Regulation (EU) No. 165/2014, which introduced support for wireless communication, positioning by Global Positioning Satellite Systems (GNSS) and new security measures for the DT system. This led to the revision of the existing DT technical specifications to a new set of specifications discussed with law enforcers, manufacturers and service providers. The new technical specifications are hundreds of pages long and they cover many different technical aspects. The goal of this paper is to describe the key elements of the new design of the smart tachograph and how it addresses the limitations of the existing DT."}{"Analyzing the critical risk factors associated with oil and gas pipeline projects in Iraq ": "Although Oil and Gas Pipelines (OGPs) are a safe and economical mode of transportation of petroleum products around the world, they face challenges caused by risk factors. These include safety, security, design, construction and operational risks due to Third Party Disruption (TPD) and acts of terrorism, particularly in developing and unstable countries like Iraq. A lack of knowledge about managing such risks and the scarcity of past data about pipeline failures are hindering OGP risk management systems. This paper, therefore, focuses on identifying and analyzing the risks caused by TDP in order to develop a holistic Risk Management Model (RMM). A semi-structured questionnaire was designed, using 30 risk factors identified through a comprehensive literature review, distributed to OGP stakeholders in Iraq, via an online survey tool, to collect the research data. SPSS was used to analyze the data and evaluate risk factors which were ranked in order of likelihood and severity level using a risk index method. A conceptual framework for the RMM is presented, based on the literature review and survey findings. The results reveal that terrorism, sabotage, oleum product transportation, however and theft are the most critical safety risks, official corruption and lawlessness the most influential factors for regulatory risks. Pipeline location \u201cHot-Zones\u201d also have a serious impact on the failure of pipelines. A computer-based risk management model will be developed at the next stage of the study using the RMM and the results of the numerical risk analysis."}{"On PLC network security ": "Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is an important component in modern Industrial Control Systems (ICS) particular in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Disturbing the normal operation of PLCs can lead to significant damages ranging from minor annoyance to large scale incidents threatening the life of people. While most of existing work in the SCADA security literature focuses on the communication between PLCs and field devices, this paper presents a network security analysis of the communication between PLCs and the engineering stations in charge of setting up and configuring them. Interestingly, this aspect of SCADA security was exploited by the most famous SCADA attack, namely, Stuxnet. Using a testbed with a common PLC device, we successfully carried out three network attacks leading to serious compromise of typical PLCs."}{"The challenge of detecting false documents at the border: Exploring the performance of humans, machines and their interaction ": "The verification of a travel document authenticity is the cornerstone of border checks. Because of pressures at the border (time constraints and increasing numbers of travellers to check) and the growing complexity of modern document security, border control capabilities (officers and/or automated systems) are tasked to rapidly and straightforwardly decide on whether the documents presented are genuine or false. Although operational performance of document inspection capabilities is of paramount importance for the effectiveness and security of border checks, the topic is rarely discussed and studied. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the development of a methodology to assess the operational performance of document inspection capabilities (human and technical) by reporting on the findings of the Document Challenge II, the second exercise of this sort performed in Lisbon in September 2013 and organized by Frontex in cooperation with the Portuguese Servico de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF), the UK National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU), the Dutch Royal Marechaussee and the German Forensic Institute of the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA)."}{"A stealth monitoring mechanism for cyber-physical systems ": "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are often used in several types of Essential Systems and Critical Infrastructures, depend on control devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers, Remote Terminal Units and Intelligent Electronic Devices. Such devices, which are deployed at the edge of the SCADA infrastructure, directly interface with the physical processes under control. They are often based on embedded systems with limited capabilities and exposed to significant security and safety-related risks, as demonstrated by past incidents such as Stuxnet. However, despite the recognized relevance of those edge devices, they usually lack monitoring mechanisms able to detect device anomalies and/or cyber-physical threats.\n                  In this paper we propose a novel approach for stealth monitoring of those control devices, for purposes of security and safety management. This approach builds on cost-effective probes, which we designate as Shadow Security Units (SSU), directly attached to the monitored control devices. This privileged positioning enables the direct and fine-grained observation of both physical inputs/outputs (i.e. the physical processes under control) and network communication flows \u2013 allowing the exploitation of various novel monitoring approaches able to address sophisticated security threats not noticeable otherwise. Moreover, the SSU approach is not limited to SCADA scenarios, being also applicable to similar domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Avionics and Self-Driving systems."}{"Multi-criteria spatial decision support system for identifying strategic roads in disaster situations ": "A road transportation network has an important role in the management of disaster situations. Despite its' vulnerability to disasters, it helps to provide emergency responses to disaster management practices. Therefore it is required to identify the most important roads in the network in order to support decision-makers to make appropriate decisions about the roads.\n                  This paper introduces an integrated methodology to evaluate the transportation network performance (TNP) in disaster situations by developing a multi-criteria spatial decision support system (MC-SDSS). The developed MC-SDSS is a fully integrated system of Geospatial Information System (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. On the one hand, GIS functionalities are used for storing the data, performing the analyses in order to produce the required criteria and displaying the results. On the other hand, AHP as a well-known MCDM method is used to receive priorities and preferences of decision-makers about the criteria.\n                  Based on the decision-making model (intelligent, design, and choice), four criteria are selected as indicators for evaluating the TNP in disaster situations: capacity, accessibility, vulnerability, and importance criteria. In this regard, criteria maps are generated by GIS tools, the experts' preferences about the criteria are acquired by AHP comparison matrix, and a ranking of the roads are prepared and visualized on the MC-SDSS. Finally, by utilizing the One-At-Time approach as the sensitivity analysis method, MC-SDSS tries to determine the robustness of the results due to the variation or uncertainty resulting from changing the important scales of the criteria in the AHP pairwise comparison matrix.\n                  The results show that about 9, 33, 20, and 38% of the roads are very high, high, moderate, and low strategic in the case study (Mazandaran province, Iran) respectively. It also shows that capacity/accessibility pairwise comparison is the most sensitive comparison in the AHP comparison matrix."}{"Key pre-distribution scheme with join leave support for SCADA systems ": "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are used in major industries to achieve greater levels of efficiency, safety and quality. Due to massive security attacks, securing such systems is a critical issue. In order to secure the communications of SCADA systems, it is observed that key pre-distribution schemes are more suitable. In this paper, we propose a matrix- based key pre-distribution scheme for SCADA systems. The scheme supports device join, leave and key update operations with less communication cost. Also, the proposed key pre-distribution scheme supports secure broadcasting, multi-casting and unicast communications between the SCADA systems. In this novel approach, secret keys are not transmitted over the network to handle the operations, such as key update, join and leave. Alternatively, each device locally computes the required keys, once they are deployed in the network. However, in these situations that the device compromises or supports forward secrecy, the auxiliary and group keys are encrypted and sent to the required devices. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme from both performance and security perspectives, it is compared with existing schemes through simulation results and analyzing the findings."}{"On the practical integration of anomaly detection techniques in industrial control applications ": "Despite significant advances made on anomaly detection systems, few reports are found documenting their practical integration into the industrial realm. Furthermore, the literature reports a wide range of complex detection strategies, which may require hardware changes/updates in order to be supported by critical industrial equipment such as industrial controllers (e.g., Programmable Logic Controllers). To address these issues, this paper documents a systematic methodology for the practical integration of lightweight anomaly detection algorithms into industrial control applications. It shows that industrial controllers, and in particular the scheduling rate of user programs, are sensitive to network traffic-based disturbances. Therefore, the methodology embraces the task scheduling rates found in control applications, and their deviation from the \u201cnormal\u201d behavior. It designs a \u201cmonitoring\u201d task, and an innovative algorithm for detecting abnormal task scheduling rates by leveraging the cumulative sum model (CUSUM) and a regression strategy applied on a specific time interval. Essentially, the approach enhances the industrial controller with a \u201csecurity module\u201d that can trigger alerts to identify early cyber attacks. The approach is extensively analyzed in the context of two industrial controllers: a Phoenix Contact ILC 350-PN controller, and a Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 Programmable controller."}{"Interdependent Critical Infrastructure Model (ICIM): An agent-based model of power and water infrastructure ": "The comfort, mobility, and economic well-being of a population depends on reliable and affordable electric power services, which in turn requires a sustainable water supply. It is therefore increasingly important to analyze the sustainability and resilience of mid- and long-term electric utility and water system capacity expansion plans. Due to the inherent interdependency between power and water critical infrastructure, these expansion plans should be analyzed with respect to potential challenges posed by climate change and other risks. Decision-makers therefore require tools that facilitate an integrated analysis that captures the interdependency of power and water to better inform future expansion plans. Here we develop an agent-based model of a typical regional power system that incorporates the features of specific plant types and their cooling systems that are dependent on adequate water supplies at appropriate temperatures to support full power operation. The effects of capacity expansion plans, power demand growth, climate change, and extreme events are analyzed through different scenarios designed to illustrate the utility of such a model and show where it can aid in mid- and long-term planning."}{"Hydropower dams of the Mekong River basin: A review of their hydrological impacts ": "Hydropower production is altering the Mekong River basin\u2019s riverine ecosystems, which contain the world\u2019s largest inland fishery and provide food security and livelihoods to millions of people. The basin\u2019s hydropower reservoir storage, which may rise from \u223c2% of its mean annual flow in 2008 to \u223c20% in 2025, is attenuating seasonal flow variability downstream of many dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs. In addition, tributary diversions for off-stream energy production are reducing downstream flows and augmenting them in recipient tributaries. To help manage tradeoffs between dam benefits (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, domestic water supply, and navigation) and their consequences for livelihoods and ecosystems, we review observed and projected impacts on river flows along both the Mekong mainstream and its tributaries. We include the effects of diversions and inter-basin transfers, which prior reviews of flow alteration in the Mekong basin have largely neglected. We also discuss the extent to which concurrent changes in climate, water demand, and land use, may offset or exacerbate hydropower-induced flow alteration. Our major recommendations for assessing hydrological impacts in the Mekong and other basins undergoing rapid hydropower development include synchronizing and integrating observational and modeling studies, improving the accuracy of reservoir water balances, evaluating multi-objective reservoir operating rules, examining hydropeaking-induced flow alteration, conducting multi-dam safety assessments, evaluating flow indicators relevant to local ecosystems and livelihoods, and considering alternative energy sources and reservoir sedimentation in long-term projections. Finally, we strongly recommend that dam impact studies consider hydrological alteration in conjunction with fish passage barriers, geomorphic changes and other contemporaneous stressors."}{"Towards baseflow index characterisation at national scale in New Zealand ": "Streamflow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation, quickflow and baseflow. Baseflow is the portion of streamflow that contains groundwater flow and flow from other delayed sources and is of key importance for river basin ecology and water resources planning and management. The BaseFlow Index (BFI) is defined as the ratio of long-term mean baseflow to total streamflow. Knowledge of the BFI is not directly available for ungauged catchments and hence for most of the terrestrial land surface. In this study, the BFI was determined for all river reaches in New Zealand. First a recursive digital filtering technique was applied to separate baseflow from total streamflow for 482 gauged sites across New Zealand, whereby an individual filter parameter was determined for each catchment. Based on the baseflow and total streamflow data the long-term BFI for each gauged site was determined, as well as seasonal values of BFI. BFI varies between 0.20 and 0.96 with an average of 0.53, which indicates that 53% of long-term streamflow in New Zealand is likely to originate from groundwater discharge and other delayed sources. Long-term BFI values for all river reaches that comprise the New Zealand river network were predicted using the random forest technique. Furthermore, the winter to summer BFI for all river reaches in New Zealand were also determined. Distinct spatial patterns of the BFI were identified. While the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the BFI was determined by a combination of factors, certain patterns can be attributed to geological formations in New Zealand, namely the volcanic plateau region and the Southern Alps. While the dataset determined in this work can support work specifically pertaining to water resources planning and management in New Zealand, in particular water supply, stream ecology and pollution risk, the methodology devised to calculate the BFI for gauged sites and to predict the BFI for ungauged sites is applicable to any region around the world."}{"Long term changes in flooding and heavy rainfall associated with North Atlantic tropical cyclones: Roles of the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation ": "The aim of this study is to examine the contribution of North Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs) to flooding and heavy rainfall across the continental United States. Analyses highlight the spatial variability in these hazards, their temporal changes in terms of frequency and magnitude, and their connection to large-scale climate, in particular to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We use long-term stream and rain gage measurements, and our analyses are based on annual maxima (AMs) and peaks-over-threshold (POTs). TCs contribute to \u223c20\u201330% of AMs and POTs over Florida and coastal areas of the eastern United States, and the contribution decreases as we move inland. We do not detect statistically significant trends in the magnitude or frequency of TC floods. Regarding the role of climate, NAO and ENSO do not play a large role in controlling the frequency and magnitude of TC flooding. The connection between heavy rainfall and TCs is comparable to what observed in terms of flooding. Unlike flooding, NAO plays a significant role in TC-related extreme rainfall along the U.S. East Coast, while ENSO is most strongly linked to the TC precipitation in Texas."}{"Megacities and rivers: Scalar mismatches between urban water management and river basin management ": "Due to rapid urbanization, population growth and economic drivers, megacities and metropolises around the world face increasing water challenges, such as water scarcity, degradation of water resources and water-related risks such as flooding. Climate change is expected to put additional stress on already strained metropolitan water management systems. Although there is considerable research on river basin management and on urban water management, there is hardly any on metropolitan water management. Similarly, as urban water generally emerges from and returns to river basins, it is surprising how little literature there is that explicitly connects these two spheres of governance. Hence this review paper addresses the: What does a review of the literature tell us about the overlap and reconciliation between the concepts of Integrated Water Resources/River Basin Management and Metropolitan/Urban Water Management, particularly in relation to megacities? Based on an extensive literature review, this paper concludes that the key differences between the two are in relation to their overarching framework, scope, inputs and outputs of water and in relation to dealing with extreme weather events. The literature review reveals how sustainable and integrated urban water management increasingly adopt principles and rhetoric from integrated water resource management, this has yet to translate into significant changing practices on the ground. Urban water management still often occurs independently of river basin issues. Achieving coherence between river basin management and sustainable/integrated urban water management is even more difficult in metropolises and megacities, because the latter consists of multiple political-administrative units. The article concludes that the scalar mismatch between river basin management and metropolitan/megacity water governance deserves much greater attention than it currently receives in the academic and policy debates."}{"Mechanisms and applications of green infrastructure practices for stormwater control: A review ": "Green Infrastructure (GI) is considered to be an innovative stormwater management approach that offers numerous other environmental benefits including reduction in air pollution and climate change mitigation compared with conventional gray infrastructures, and it has been gradually accepted and used worldwide. This review mainly focuses on the hydrological aspect of GI and provides a summary of the knowledge about GI as a stormwater management alternative. In this review, we discuss the operating mechanisms of a few widely-used GIs in the aspect of stormwater management. We critically examine policies for promoting GI implementation in some countries, including the sponge city in China and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) in Australia, and review the effectiveness of GI on treating stormwater quantity in real world applications. In addition, we also used Bibliometrics to analyze the GI research trends and found GI has been popular in an increasing number of countries and regions, which China has the greatest future growth potential in GIs research. Moreover, many barriers impeding the further development of GI and strategies to overcome these barriers are also summarized. This review gathers knowledge from many sources to provide an overview of GI to better understand its mechanisms and applications, and to highlight the areas that require future study."}{"Urban flood resilience \u2013 A multi-criteria index to integrate flood resilience into urban planning ": "Climate change and increasing urbanization pose huge challenges in managing urban planning for a sustainable future. Intense urbanization resulting in the so-called mega cites aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow routes. Statistics show that flood disasters are one of the most significant in terms of damages and losses. Urbanization rates are increasing rapidly and it is important to learn how to live with floods by alleviating their consequences, in the present and future. This concern points to the resilience concept. By including the concept of resilience in flood risk analysis and decision-making, urban drainage design moves towards sustainable drainage systems. This study discusses resilience in the flood risk contextWe considered three main drivers to define a quantitative measure of flood resilience: the capability of a drainage system to resist and provide its service continuously over time; the capability of an urban area to recover from flood losses; and the capability of urban systems to evacuate floodwaters and return to a functional state. Consequently, this paper describes how flood resilience can be modeled and spatialized by a multi-criteria index called Spatialized Urban Flood Resilience Index (S-FRESI). The S-FRESI composition (according to the resilience definition adopted) combines: the hazard characteristics and the system exposure and susceptibility, to represent flood resistance mapped over time; the ability for material recovery from losses caused by inundation, considering the income variable; and the functional capacity of the drainage system, represented by the flood duration. S-FRESI can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience attained by different flood control measures, as well as in future scenarios of population growth, uncontrolled urbanization or climate change. The index was tested with coherent and consistent results in the Dona Eug\u00eania river catchment in Rio de Janeiro. Four different scenarios were formulated: (1) the current situation; (2) the current situation considering the implementation of sustainable flood control measures; (3) a future situation with the same infrastructure as today; and (4) a future situation with the considered flood control measures."}{"Experimental modelling of urban flooding: A review ": "We review the 45 available studies of urban flooding based on laboratory experiments. We distinguish between the studies focusing on the flow in (i) a single street intersection, (ii) surface-sewer exchanges, (iii) an array of obstacles and (iv) quasi-realistic urban districts. We discuss the main flow processes which are covered in the various studies and detail which flow variables were recorded. This enables identifying flow processes for which comprehensive experimental datasets are available from those which require additional experimental research. We also highlight the typical ranges of scale factors used, which depend mainly on the extent of the studied area (from very local up to the district level). This review aims at helping computational modellers to pinpoint the most suitable dataset for validating their numerical approaches and laboratory modellers to identify gaps in current experimental knowledge of urban flooding."}{"A comparative study of available water in the major river basins of the world ": "Numerous large river basins of the world have few and irregular observations of the components of the terrestrial hydrological cycle with the exception of stream gauges at a few locations and at the outlet along with sparsely distributed rain gauges. Using observations from satellite sensors and output from global land surface models, it is possible to study these under-observed river basins. With populations greater than a billion people, some of these rivers (e.g., the Ganga-Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, the Nile and the Mekong) are the economic engines of the countries they transect, yet thorough assessment of their flow dynamics and variability in regard to water resource management is still lacking. In this paper, we use soil moisture (0\u20132\u202fm) and surface runoff from the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), evapotranspiration, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and total water storage anomaly from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to examine variability of individual water balance components. To this end, understanding the inter-annual and intra-seasonal variability and the spatial variability of the water balance components in the major river basins of the world will help to plan for improved management of water resources for the future."}{"Water conflict management and cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan ": "Managing water resource systems usually involves conflicts. Water recognizes no borders, defining the global geopolitics of water conflicts, cooperation, negotiations, management, and resource development. Negotiations to develop mechanisms for two or more states to share an international watercourse involve complex networks of natural, social and political system (Islam and Susskind, 2013). The Kabul River Basin presents unique circumstances for developing joint agreements for its utilization, rendering moot unproductive discussions of the rights of upstream and downstream states based on principles of absolute territorial sovereignty or absolute territorial integrity (McCaffrey, 2007). This paper analyses the different stages of water conflict transformation between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It first examines historical disputes between the upstream and downstream riparians, revolving around contending rights claims, resulting in zero-sum confrontations with one party\u2019s loss as another\u2019s gain, possibly ending in confrontation. The paper then formulates a decision support tool, a mechanism for transforming conflict into cooperation, and concludes by introducing practical methods for identifying basin needs and sharing benefits, enabling riparians to negotiate a win-win process."}{"Advances in water resources research in the Upper Blue Nile basin and the way forward: A review ": "The Upper Blue Nile basin is considered as the lifeline for \u223c250 million people and contributes \u223c50\u202fGm3/year of water to the Nile River. Poor land management practices in the Ethiopian highlands have caused a significant amount of soil erosion, thereby threatening the productivity of the Ethiopian agricultural system, degrading the health of the aquatic ecosystem, and shortening the life of downstream reservoirs. The Upper Blue Nile basin, because of limited research and availability of data, has been considered as the \u201cgreat unknown.\u201d In the recent past, however, more research has been published. Nonetheless, there is no state-of-the-art review that presents research achievements, gaps and future directions. Hence, this paper aims to bridge this gap by reviewing the advances in water resources research in the basin while highlighting research needs and future directions. We report that there have been several research projects that try to understand the biogeochemical processes by collecting information on runoff, groundwater recharge, sediment transport, and tracers. Different types of hydrological models have been applied. Most of the earlier research used simple conceptual and statistical approaches for trend analysis and water balance estimations, mainly using rainfall and evapotranspiration data. More recent research has been using advanced semi-physically/physically based distributed hydrological models using high-resolution temporal and spatial data for diverse applications. We identified several research gaps and provided recommendations to address them. While we have witnessed advances in water resources research in the basin, we also foresee opportunities for further advancement. Incorporating the research findings into policy and practice will significantly benefit the development and transformation agenda of the Ethiopian government."}{"Basin-scale hydrology and sediment dynamics of the Kosi river in the Himalayan foreland ": "Hydrological and sediment transport characteristics for the Kosi basin, which covers parts of Nepal and India, were analysed to understand the spatiotemporal variability of the hydrology and sediment dynamics of the Kosi basin and its implications for flood hazard and sediment dynamics. The study revealed that \u223c56% of the discharge at Chatara (where all major tributaries of the Kosi meet) is contributed from the western part of the basin even though this constitutes only 34% of the total basin area. In contrast, the central and eastern parts of the basin constitute 57% and 8% of the basin area but contribute \u223c38% and \u223c16% of the discharge at Chatara, respectively. The contribution of sediment load at Chatara from the different tributaries of the Kosi River also shows a similar pattern. Of a total of \u223c100 million tonnes of the annual sediment load at Chatara, \u223c56% is transported from four tributaries: the Indrawati, Bhote Kosi, Tama Kosi (all draining from the west), and Tamor. The remaining \u223c44% is transported by other tributaries upstream of Chatara, the most important being the Arun, Dudh Kosi, and Sun Kosi. Sediment budgeting in this study, based on annual sediment load data, suggested that \u223c20 million tonnes of sediments are deposited between Chatara and Birpur annually. This study also found that \u223c53 million tonnes of sediments are being accommodated between Birpur and Baltara annually. Sediment dynamics in the Kosi basin emerges as the most important river management issue, and this is closely linked to channel instability and frequent flooding in the alluvial plains."}{"Lithium-ion battery recycling processes: Research towards a sustainable course ": "There is a need to develop technology to enable a resource-efficient and economically feasible recycling system for lithium-ion batteries and thus assure the future supply of the component materials. Lithium-ion batteries are complex products, and designs and materials are still evolving, which makes planning for future recovery more challenging. Several processes for recycling are proposed or operating, and each has advantages and disadvantages. This paper compares these processes on technical and economic bases, elucidating differences in benefits as a function of cathode composition. Since none of the existing processes is ideal, research areas are suggested that could enable development of improved recycling methods. The most promising research areas are separation technologies."}{"Critical raw materials: A perspective from the materials science community ": "Functional materials are crucial to meet today's societal challenges and needs, such as the transition towards low carbon energy production to reduce climate change, renewable energies and green economy, clean mobility and improved communication. In order to fulfill specific functions, many of these materials require a variety of specific metallic elements whose total reserves in primary deposits on the planet are limited in quantity and unevenly distributed, respectively require significant efforts for exploration and investments in their exploitation. Furthermore, the extraction and processing of the corresponding metallic minerals can be sometimes related to a high environmental burden as well as frequently negative social impacts. While in contrast to fossil fuels mineral materials can be principally recycled and hence kept as resources, closing the materials loop especially for many specialty metals today is often hampered by dissipation as well as by physical and economic challenges. These metallic elements are also listed under \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d which have been receiving increased attention in scientific and policy-related debates over the last decade and years. In this paper, we introduce the topic of materials criticality for the special issue of Sustainable Materials and Technologies and observe how the criticality of raw materials is perceived and handled within Materials Science. For this, we (i) present examples of critical raw materials in advanced technologies, (ii) summarize some definitions of criticality, (iii) outline the topic of critical raw materials in the Material Scientist community by highlighting relevant outcomes of a survey on critical raw materials for materials scientists, and (iv) conduct a literature research on \u201cCritical Raw Materials\u201d and \u201cCriticality\u201d in search engines commonly used by materials scientists. The results show that material scientists seem frequently not concerned with the criticality of raw materials in their work, and that the relevant terms appear for a broader scientific community mainly in the fields of environmental science, chemistry-related processing and environmental and resource management. The paper presents and discusses these results and suggests to advance the implementation of the concept of materials criticality in materials research and development."}{"The case for recycling: Overview and challenges in the material supply chain for automotive li-ion batteries ": "Lithium ion batteries (LIB) continue to gain market share in response to the increasing demand for electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and energy storage. The increased demand for LIB has highlighted potential problems in the supply chain of raw materials needed for their manufacture. Some critical metals used in LIB, namely lithium, cobalt, and graphite are scarce, are not currently mined in large quantities, or are mined in only a few countries whose trade policies could limit availability and impact prices. The environmental and social impacts of mining these materials have also drawn attention as production ramps up to meet the increased demand. Closed-loop systems with recycling at the end-of-life provide a pathway to lower environmental impacts and a source of high value materials that can be used in producing new batteries. Because environmental regulations concerning end-of-life batteries are not fully developed or implemented, most of these batteries currently end up in the landfills, with a very small number of spent batteries sent to the existing recycling facilities. However, with proactive regulations, an increasing supply of spent batteries, and innovations in recycling technologies, end-of-life batteries could supply a significant fraction of the materials needed for manufacturing of new LIB. This paper reviews the current state of the LIB manufacturing supply chain, addresses some issues associated with battery end-of-life, and sheds light on the importance of LIB recycling from the environmental and value chain perspectives. We also discuss the expected benefits of recycling on the global LIB supply chain."}{"Improving supply security of critical metals: Current developments and research in the EU ": "According to the reports on critical raw materials for the EU, a raw material is considered critical if it has a high economic importance to the EU combined with high supply risk. Supply risk is considered to arise from a combination of several factors, namely a high concentration of production in countries with poor governance, limited material substitutability, and poor end-of-life recycling rates. A number of industry activities, policy initiatives and research projects have recently been initiated in Europe with the aim to secure an adequate supply of raw materials. In this article, we review such ongoing developments with a focus on publicly funded research projects on critical metals in Europe, and discuss their contribution to reaching the objectives of the Raw Materials Initiative as well as the more general goals of sustainability. We found that current research puts a strong emphasis on rare earth elements, being addressed in almost half of the identified projects. Other frequently studied metals include cobalt, indium and platinum group metals. The efforts are roughly evenly distributed between the three main domains of supply security measures: primary supply, secondary supply, and material efficiency and substitution, with a somewhat larger budget allocated to secondary supply. Current research is coherent with the aims of the Raw Materials Initiative in that it addresses primary production, recycling, and substitution as means to secure the supply of critical metals. However, the prioritization of certain metals, especially rare earth elements, is stronger than what seems justified by differences in economic risk (as a quantitative interpretation of criticality), and should perhaps be replaced by a more balanced distribution of funds. For example, more product-centric research considering a larger part of the materials cycle may facilitate recycling of a wider spectrum of metals. Particularly neglected metals and topics include beryllium, magnesium, recycling from end-of-life vehicles, design for recycling, and waste collection."}{"An exploratory study on factors influencing undergraduate students\u2019 academic writing practices in Turkey ": "In EAP contexts, attaining a desired level of competence and fluency in academic writing is important for students majoring in English-medium undergraduate programs because their academic achievements are determined by the texts they produce in English. Undergraduate students in Turkey are observed to experience difficulties with academic writing as they try to accommodate their existing writing knowledge to the requirements of the new discipline-specific writing and learning situation of tertiary level education. Placing the students at the core of inquiry, the study explored factors influencing students' academic writing practices in English. The participants of the study were nineteen English major undergraduate students studying in Istanbul. The main data were obtained from background questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and were qualitatively analysed. The findings revealed that undergraduate writing is influenced by an array of interrelating educational and contextual factors: (1) the amount and nature of L1 and L2 pre-university writing instruction and experience, (2) students\u2019 perceptions about academic writing and disciplinary-specific text genres, (3) prolonged engagement with the academic context and discourse, and (4) expectations of faculty members. The insights gained from the study provide important implications for reconceptualization of writing instruction in Turkey."}{"I am what I have written: A case study of identity construction in and through personal statement writing ": "The case study attempts to explore identity construction by examining a Chinese college student's personal statement writing. Based on Ivanic's framework of writer identity construction, an analysis of similarities and differences was made on the student's personal statements written for four different programs over a three-year period. It is found that the student constructed the desired writer identity of a qualified and special applicant who would fit into the target program mainly by making three discoursal choices for different self-representations, namely, narrating life experiences, referring to oneself and others, and highlighting. The interview results indicate that personal statement writing helped the student perceive her self and identity, both retrospectively and prospectively. It offers a significant implication for academic writing teaching and research. It is hoped that this case study can stimulate further research of identity construction in and through the personal statement as an occluded academic genre."}{"Writer background and voice construction in L2 writing ": "In the field of second language writing, some scholars argue that the concept of authorial voice is too culturally loaded to be accessible to L2 students, especially those from collectively-oriented cultures. Others, however, provide evidence, although not yet conclusive, showing that writers' cultural background may not affect their ability to construct an authorial voice. Given such conflicting arguments, and also in response to Tardy's (2012) call for research on the impact of extra-textual writer identity on voice construction, this study empirically examined the extent to which key writer background variables, such as age, gender, cultural background, and level of exposure to the target language and culture, may influence L2 writers' voice construction. Two hundred argumentative essays from L2 writers of various backgrounds were analyzed in terms of overall voice salience and use of individual voice elements. Correlational and regression analysis results showed that, overall, these variables had very limited, if any, impact on L2 writers' textual voice construction. The observed lack of strong association between voice salience and cultural background corroborates and supplements findings from previous research with a more qualitative approach, thus calling for a more cautious interpretation of the role of culture in voice development and L2 writing."}{"Authorial voice constructed in citation in literature reviews of doctoral theses: Variations across training contexts ": "Constructing authorial voice is considered essential in English academic texts. Citation as an important discursive feature contributing to authorial voice has been underexplored, despite fruitful research on citation practices. It also remains largely unknown whether variations in citation-based voice construction exist in doctoral theses completed across training contexts. This study explores and compares authorial voice constructed in citation in the literature review chapters of 20 doctoral theses written by home-grown and overseas-trained Chinese writers (HGWT and OTWT), complemented by interviews with four of the 20 writers. It was found that compared to the HGWT, the OTWT displayed significantly greater use of non-integral citations, \u201cauthor as agent\u201d integral forms, and summary that contribute to authorial voice. Descriptive statistics for the two subcorpora also suggested that authorial voice was more often communicated via lexical devices loaded with evaluation by the ten home-grown writers whereas the ten overseas-trained writers preferred syntactic and discoursal devices. While the present results are more suggestive than deterministic, this study highlights the importance of promoting novice writers' awareness of the obscure and often unnoticed role of citation in constructing authorial voice."}{"Academic emotions in written corrective feedback situations ": "Although written corrective feedback (WCF) is often believed to evoke negative emotions, empirical studies on L2 students' affective reactions to this teaching and learning device are still lacking. Informed by research on academic emotions (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun & Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2012), the paper reports on two case studies investigating Chinese university EFL students' emotional reactions to teacher WCF. Self-report data collected from retrospective verbal reports and interviews constituted most of the data, supplemented by observation notes, student writing, and class documents. Qualitative data analysis revealed the richness and dynamicity of the focal students\u2019 emotional reactions to WCF. While both students reported being emotionally undisturbed by WCF, they in fact experienced different discrete emotions with varying object foci, valence, and activation, and these emotions fluctuated in the revision process. The findings question the presumed connection between WCF and negative emotions, suggesting the inadequacy of the positive-negative distinction of emotions and the need for a more nuanced understanding of emotional reactions to feedback."}{"Knowledge construction of discussion/conclusion sections of research articles written by English L1 and L2 and Castilian Spanish L1 writers ": "The paper investigates the Discussion/Conclusion sections of research articles (RA) written by English L1, English L2 and Spanish L1 writers in applied linguistics, seeking to assist scholars in Spain and Latin America to get published in reputable international English-language journals, i.e. those listed in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). It draws on move analysis, contrasting texts written in two languages and by three groups of writers, a first in the literature. The study will advance our understanding of the complexity of these RA sections, and the difficulties faced by scholars whose first language is not English but who are under institutional pressure to publish in English. Results showed variances in the move structures in the Discussion/Conclusion sections written by the three groups. The English L1 group produced more rhetorically complex texts than the Spanish L1 group, while the English L2 group displayed hybridity in their texts as they brought to the fore the rhetorical practices of their L1 culture. The findings are expected to assist scholars to make their intellectual contributions accessible in mainstream international publications, whatever their native language."}{"Theme-Rheme structure in Chinese doctoral students' research writing ---- From the first draft to the published paper ": "This study examines the first draft and the published version of the Discussion sections of 20 medical research articles produced by Chinese doctoral students to track the changes in Theme-Rheme structure made in the process of revision. The results show that the modifications included conjunctive adjuncts and coordinating conjunctions that were used improperly in the first drafts. Half of the projecting clauses starting with the first person pronoun \u201cwe\u201d were changed. More than half of the long, fully lexicalized pre-subject ideational components were modified so that the topic-revealing information could be reached more quickly. Most importantly, the majority of information discontinuity, represented by deviated thematic progressions, was adjusted through revision, which greatly increased the readability of the papers. In summary, the modifications in terms of Theme-Rheme structure are prominent and contribute essentially to the readability as well as publishability of the articles. Novice ESL/EFL research writers may lack and need the knowledge of the structure even though they are advanced language learners/users. It is recommended that explicit instructions regarding the structure be incorporated in a graduate-level writing class and teacher training be performed to ensure effective instruction."}{"The age and tectonic setting of the Lukinda dunite-gabbro-anorthosite massif in the east of the Selenga-Stanovoi superterrane, Central Asian Fold Belt ": "Results of integrated 40Ar/39Ar, Rb-Sr, and Sm-Nd geochronological studies of the Lukinda dunite-troctolite-gabbro-anorthosite massif in the northeast of the Selenga-Stanovoi superterrane, Central Asian Fold Belt, are presented. It is shown that this massif is much younger than formerly thought: 249 \u00b1 14 to 251 \u00b1 15 Ma vs. Paleoproterozoic. This date of magmatism corresponds to one of the stages of the formation of the Selenga-Vitim belt, which ranks among the largest Phanerozoic volcanoplutonic belts in Central Asia."}{"Geochemical features and genesis of continental cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts ": "Mass cobalt-rich ferromanganese microcrusts and nodules similar in morphology and chemical composition to cobalt-rich ferromanganese deep-ocean crusts were found in Cenozoic volcanic rocks in southern Primorye. Research has shown that ore genesis of this type is genetically related to argillization and destruction of siliceous rocks by CO2-rich fluids, which is confirmed by experimental data on carbon erosion of iron-containing materials. Two types of this fluid ore genesis are recognized: (1) relatively high-temperature (vapor-condensate), related to late volcanic processes and fracture gas infiltration, and (2) low-temperature (vapor-liquid-condensate), controlled by degassing followed by carbon mobilization (gasification). Primarily colloidal ferromanganese segregations have high contents of Co, Ni, Pb, Cu, and Ce, typical of oceanic ore genesis. Regardless of the concentrations of these metals in the protoliths, their contents in microcrusts are similar (n-10n wt.%). This indicates the same ore genesis mechanism and similar sorption properties of the colloidal ferromanganese material formed. Barium- and cerium-rich ferromanganese microcrusts and nodules are abundant. Condensed drops of iron-containing platinum were found in apobasaltic nickel-rich ferromanganese segregations. There is a cerium paradox expressed as a minimum or a total lack of cerium among rare-earth phosphates associated with ferromanganese microcrusts. Fluid destruction and oxide metallization of ocean-floor basalts are assumed to be the main source of metals for oceanic ferromanganese crusts and nodules."}{"Comparisons among the Oortsog, Dulaan, and Nomgon mafic-ultramafic intrusions in central Mongolia and Ni-Cu deposits in NW China: implications for economic Ni-Cu-PGE ore exploration in central Mongolia ": "Although there are many mafic-ultramafic intrusions in the western and central regions of Mongolia, Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), no economic-grade Ni-Cu deposits have yet been discovered. To understand the economic Ni-Cu deposit potential of the intrusions in central Mongolia, the parental magma affinity and sulfide saturation of the Oortsog, Dulaan, and Nomgon Ni-Cu mineralized mafic-ultramafic intrusions are studied. These three intrusions are predominantly gabbroic in composition, while the Oortsog and Dulaan intrusions also contain small proportions of peridotites. The parental magmas of the Oortsog and Dulaan intrusions are tholeiitic, as indicated by their Cr-spinel and clinopyroxene compositions, whereas the parental magma of the Nomgon intrusions is likely calc-alkaline. The compositions of Cr-spinel and clinopyroxene, combined with the presence of significant Nb-Ta depletions, indicate that these rocks were most likely derived from modified mantle sources. Both the Oortsog and Nomgon intrusions form two clusters in terms of their olivine composition, suggesting that multiple magma surges were involved during their emplacement. The relatively low Fo values and Ni contents in olivine from the three intrusions compared to those from Ni-Cu deposits in NW China, as well as those in the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit in Canada, indicate that the three intrusions were crystallized from relatively evolved magmas. The Cu/Zr ratios of rocks of the Oortsog, Dulaan, and Nomgon intrusions are higher than 1, suggesting that these rocks contain cumulus sulfide. This, coupled with the presence of rounded sulfide inclusions in olivine of the Oortsog and Dulaan intrusions, suggests that sulfide saturation occurred before or during olivine crystallization. The distribution patterns of platinum group elements (PGEs) of the Dulaan and Oortsog intrusions record slight Rh, Pt, and Pd (PPGE) enrichment relative to Os, Ir, and Rh (IPGE). Furthermore, the Ni/Cu ratios of sulfide-bearing rocks from the Oortsog intrusion vary from 1.8 to 3.8, which are consistent with those of the Ni-Cu sulfide deposits in NW China. In contrast, the Ni/Cu ratios of sulfide-bearing rocks from the Nomgon intrusion are extremely low (0.03 to 0.07). This, together with the significant enrichment in PPGE relative to IPGE, suggests that these sulfides of the Nomgon intrusion were segregated from a magma that was extremely enriched in Cu and PPGE but depleted in Ni and IPGE. The characteristics of the chalcophile elements in these intrusions are attributed to the fact that the derivation of the Nomgon magma was significantly different from that of the Dulaan and Oortsog parental magmas. Overall, although the parental magmas of the intrusions in central Mongolia are more evolved than those in NW China, they are comparable in terms of the sizes of their intrusions, constituent minerals, and mineral chemistry. These similarities suggest that the intrusions in central Mongolia have economic Ni-Cu sulfide potential. Furthermore, intrusions similar to the Nomgon intrusion may feature PGE mineralization potential."}{"Jurassic and Cretaceous biostratigraphy and organic matter geochemistry of the New Siberian Islands (Russian Arctic)\n             ": "The Jurassic-Cretaceous terrigenous complex of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas is of considerable interest as a potential exploration target. However, the key Jurassic and Cretaceous sections of the New Siberian Islands have been poorly studied. The results of this study were used to provide a detailed micropaleontological description of these sections and substantiation of the previous lithostratigraphic subdivision. We first identified a series of Boreal standard zones in the Jurassic and Cretaceous sections, based on the foraminifers, ostracods, dinocysts, and terrestrial palynomorphs. Our results, along with the published data on ammonites, bivalves, and terrestrial palynomorphs and the results of radiometric dating, provide more precise constraints on the stratigraphic position of the identified lithostratigraphic units. The results of this study can be corroborated by seismic data to explore offshore areas of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas. We also present detailed data on the geochemistry of organic matter from the Pestsovaya Formation (Hettangian-lowermost Upper Pliensbachian)."}{"Potentialities of ultrawideband GPR in low-resistivity geoenvironments ": "We assess the potentia4lities of ultrawideband (UWB) electromagnetic pulse sounding of low-resistivity geoenvironments using the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system developed by us and compare the obtained results with 2D electrical resistivity tomography and standard GPR data. The research was performed in an area of Quaternary clay deposits with a resistivity of 20-50 Ohmm. For an OKO-2 GPR antenna with a center frequency of 150 MHz, the sounding depth is 2-4 m, whereas UWB sounding provides penetration of the GPR pulse to a depth of 30-40 m. Deep UWB sounding of low-resistivity environments is possible under the following conditions: use of generators based on drift step recovery diodes (DSRDs), high matching of the UWB receiving and transmitting antennas to the environment, and an increase in the noise immunity of the recording system, in particular, due to a decrease in the intensity of air waves."}{"Magmatism and metallogeny of the Early Earth as a reflection of its geologic evolution ": "The paper is focused on the evolution of the Earth starting with the planetary accretion and differentiation of the primordial material (similar in composition to CI chondrites) into the core and mantle and the formation of the Moon as a result of the impact of the Earth with a smaller cosmic body. The features of the Hadean eon (ca. 4500\u20134000 Ma) are described in detail. Frequent meteorite-asteroid bombardments which the Earth experienced in the Hadean could have caused the generation of mafic/ultramafic primary magmas. These magmas also differentiated to produce some granitic magmas, from which zircons crystallized. The repeated meteorite bombardments destroyed the protocrust, which submerged into the mantle to remelt, leaving refractory zircons, indicators of the Early Earth\u2019s geologic conditions, behind.\n                  The mantle convection that started in the Archean could possibly be responsible for the Earth\u2019s subsequent endogenous evolution. Long-living deep-seated mantle plumes could have promoted the generation of basalt-komatiitic crust, which, thickening, could have submerged into the mantle as a result of sagduction, where it remelted. Partial melting of the thick crust, leaving eclogite as a residue, could have yielded tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) melts. TTG rocks are believed to compose the Earth\u2019s protocrust. Banded iron bodies, the only mineral deposits of that time, were produced in the oceans that covered the Earth.\n                  This environment, recognized as LID tectonics combined with plume tectonics, probably existed on the Earth prior to the transitional period, which was marked by a series of new geologic processes and led to a modern-style tectonics, involving plate tectonics and plume tectonics mechanisms, by 2 Ga. The transitional period was likely to be initiated at about 3.4 Ga, with the segregation of outer and inner cores, which terminated by 3.1 Ga. Other rocks series (calc-alkaline volcanic and intrusive) rather than TTGs were produced at that time. Beginning from 3.4-3.3 Ga, mineral deposits became more diverse; noble and siderophile metal occurrences were predominant among ore deposits. Carbonatites, hosting rare-metal mineralization, could have formed only by 2.0 Ga. From 3.1 to 2.7 Ga, there was a period of \u201csmall-plate\u201d tectonics and first subduction and spreading processes, which resulted in the first supercontinent by 2.7 Ga. Its amalgamation indicates the start of superplume-supercontinent cycles.\n                  Between 2.7 and 2.0 Ga, the D\u2033 layer formed at the core-mantle interface. It became a kind of thermal regulator for the ascending already tholeiitic mantle plume magmas. All deep-seated layers of the Earth and large low-velocity shear provinces, called mantle hot fields, partially melted enriched EM-I and EM-II mantles, and the depleted recent asthenosphere mantle, which is parental for midocean-ridge basalts, were finally generated by 2 Ga. Therefore, an interaction of all Earth\u2019s layers began from that time."}{"Interaction of crustal and mantle materials, sources of trace elements during the formation and evolution of Early Paleozoic Li-rich granite-pegmatite systems in southeastern Tuva ": "We present new data on the age, composition, and environments of formation of granites of the Kystarys complex and the associated Li-rich rare-element pegmatites of the South Sangilen pegmatite belt including the large Tastyg lithium deposit. It has been established that they formed during the Early Paleozoic collisional orogeny in the Tuva-Mongolian massif at the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary. The granites of the Kystarys complex are moderately alkaline high-K rocks and are enriched in Zr, Nb, Y, and REE; therefore, they are classified as postcollisional, transitional to within-plate (A-type). The spodumene pegmatites of the South Sangilen pegmatite belt are similar to the above granites in age and isotopic and geochemical parameters, which suggests a paragenetic relationship between these rocks. Pegmatites form several pegmatite fields within the belt, which differ in trace-element signatures. In addition to predominant Li, Cs, and Ta, specific to all spodumene pegmatites (LCT family), pegmatites of two fields have high contents of Nb, Y, REE, and Zr, which are indicator elements of NYF family pegmatites. It has been established that the formation of spodumene pegmatites with combined LCT-NYF geochemical signatures was preceded by the intrusion of dikes of monzogabbro with the geochemical characteristics of OIB and of alkali aegirine granites and by the formation of associated metasomatites enriched in Zr, Nb, Y, and REE. Based on the geological, mineralogical, and geochemical data, we substantiate the hypothesis of the formation of Li-bearing granite-pegmatite melts from a mixed source resulted from the influence of fluids of an alkaline igneous complex of mantle genesis on the crustal protolith."}{"Partitioning of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances from soil to groundwater within aqueous film-forming foam source zones ": "Metadata from on-going site investigations at U.S. Air Force sites impacted by Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) were used to evaluate primary factors that affect transport of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) within source zones. Soil-to-groundwater ratios (\u03b3Soil-GW) were calculated for each site and PFAS as an empirical transport metric and regressed against select soil chemical and physical properties, as well as relevant interactions thereof, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Total organic carbon and percent total clay content were significant covariates and best fit log-transformed \u03b3Soil-GW with a parallel lines model. Regression parameters were used to derive apparent KOC estimates for 15 perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, and the 6:2 and 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonates, which were bimodal where significant differences were primarily observed between PFAS with fewer than 8 perfluorinated carbons (including perfluorooctoanoic acid; PFOA) and those with 8 or more (including perfluorooctane sulfonate; PFOS). Surprisingly, clay content was observed with a negative slope (i.e., \u03b3Soil-GW decreased with increasing clay content), which may reflect greater retardation at more permeable sites due to air-water interfacial partitioning. Further analysis demonstrated that \u03b3Soil-GW is also affected by the degree of flushing in a way that suggests mass transfer (as opposed to hysteretic desorption) primarily controls mass discharge at poorly flushed sites. Overall, this meta-analysis demonstrates that PFAS retention in soil is significant, but depends on a combination of fundamental partitioning mechanisms that may not be predictable in all cases based on transport models that assume an equilibrium condition."}{"The effect of freezing and thawing on water flow and MCPA leaching in partially frozen soil ": "Limited knowledge and experimental data exist on pesticide leaching through partially frozen soil. The objective of this study was to better understand the complex processes of freezing and thawing and the effects these processes have on water flow and pesticide transport through soil. To achieve this we conducted a soil column irrigation experiment to quantify the transport of a non-reactive tracer and the herbicide MCPA in partially frozen soil. In total 40 intact topsoil and subsoil columns from two agricultural fields with contrasting soil types (silt and loam) in South-East Norway were used in this experiment. MCPA and bromide were applied on top of all columns. Half the columns were then frozen at \u22123\u202f\u00b0C while the other half of the columns were stored at +4\u202f\u00b0C. Columns were then subjected to repeated irrigation events at a rate of 5\u202fmm artificial rainwater for 5\u202fh at each event. Each irrigation was followed by 14-day periods of freezing or refrigeration. Percolate was collected and analysed for MCPA and bromide. The results show that nearly 100% more MCPA leached from frozen than unfrozen topsoil columns of Hov silt and Kroer loam soils. Leaching patterns of bromide and MCPA were very similar in frozen columns with high concentrations and clear peaks early in the irrigation process, and with lower concentrations leaching at later stages. Hardly any MCPA leached from unfrozen topsoil columns (0.4\u20130.5% of applied amount) and concentrations were very low. Bromide showed a different flow pattern indicating a more uniform advective-dispersive transport process in the unfrozen columns with higher concentrations leaching but without clear concentration peaks. This study documents that pesticides can be preferentially transported through soil macropores at relatively high concentrations in partially frozen soil. These findings indicate, that monitoring programs should include sampling during snow melt or early spring in areas were soil frost is common as this period could imply exposure peaks in groundwater or surface water."}{"The long term effect of agricultural, vadose zone and climatic factors on nitrate contamination in Nebraska's groundwater system ": "A four-decade dataset (1974\u20132013) of 107,823 nitrate samples in 25,993 wells from western and eastern parts of Nebraska was used to assess long-term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration and decadal changes in the extent of groundwater nitrate-contaminated areas (NO3-N\u202f\u2265\u202f10\u202fmg\u202fN/L) over the entire state. Spatial statistics and regressions were used to investigate the relationships between groundwater nitrate concentrations and several potential natural and anthropogenic factors, including soil drainage capacities, vadose zone characteristics, crop production areas, and irrigation systems. The results of this study show that there is no statistically significant trend in groundwater nitrate concentrations in western Nebraska, in contrast with the increasing trend (p\u202f<\u202f.05) to the east. The spatial extent and nitrate concentrations in contaminated groundwater in center pivot-irrigated areas was less than in gravity-irrigated areas. Areas with a thicker vadose zone and larger saturated thickness of the aquifer have relatively lower nitrate concentrations. The results of a classification and regression tree (CART) model indicate the difference in the influence of physical factors on groundwater nitrate concentrations between western and eastern Nebraska, namely that groundwater nitrate concentrations correspond with vadose zone thickness, effective hydraulic conductivity, and saturated thickness in the west, while in eastern Nebraska, concentrations are correlated with average percent sand in the topsoil (0\u2013150\u202fcm), well depth, and effective hydraulic conductivity."}{"A simple contaminant fate and transport modelling tool for management and risk assessment of groundwater pollution from contaminated sites ": "Contaminated sites pose a significant threat to groundwater resources. The resources that can be allocated by water regulators for site investigation and cleanup are limited compared to the large number of contaminated sites. Numerical transport models of individual sites require large amounts of data and are labor intensive to set up, and thus they are likely to be too expensive to be useful in the management of thousands of contaminated sites. Therefore, simple tools based on analytical solutions of contaminant transport models are widely used to assess (at an early stage) whether a site might pose a threat to groundwater. We present a tool consisting of five different models, representing common geological settings, contaminant pathways, and transport processes. The tool employs a simplified approach for preliminary, conservative, fast and inexpensive estimation of the contamination levels of aquifers. This is useful for risk assessment applications or to select and prioritize the sites, which should be targeted for further investigation. The tool is based on steady-state semi-analytical models simulating different contaminant transport scenarios from the source to downstream groundwater, and includes both unsaturated and saturated transport processes. The models combine existing analytical solutions from the literature for vertical (from the source to the top of the aquifer) and horizontal (within the aquifer) transport. The effect of net recharge causing a downward migration and an increase of vertical dispersion and dilution of the plume is also considered. Finally, we illustrate the application of the tool for a preliminary assessment of two contaminated sites in Denmark and compare the model results with field data. The comparison shows that a first preliminary assessment with conservative, and often non-site specific parameter selection, is qualitatively consistent with broad trends in observations and provides a conservative estimate of contamination."}{"Prediction of annual drinking water quality reduction based on Groundwater Resource Index using the artificial neural network and fuzzy clustering ": "Drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting different aspects of human life and the environment. Due to water scarcity, prediction of water quality reduction is very crucial for urban and rural communities. This study contributes by applying artificial neural network and modified fuzzy clustering techniques to estimate the drops in potential drinking water quality in the GIS environment. In this research, the probability of occurrence of adverse annual changes in the water quality of drinking water is estimated. The model was tested using real instances of the southeast aquifers, the regions of the central parts of the IRAN and especially the significant portions of the aquifers of the east area. To validate the model, the data adequacy test and the standardization of the drought index are used. The results of the lowest available water quality and the highest drought using ANNs show that the qualitative stress conditions in large part of the country's aquifers are in unfavorable conditions. Evidence from this research shows that the aquifers in these areas are expected to have severe drought stress and poor quality class status. Also, the computational results indicate that the modified clustering method increases the efficiency of the prediction model as against the previous research. The outcomes do not show a relatively favorable state of drinking water quality for some aquifers in the country. However, the conditions for quantitative changes in the depth of water, based on the predicted results of ANN, are considered critical. The generated maps demonstrate that about 64% of the study area is subjected to a severe deterioration in the quality of drinking water if the current trend continues in the exploitation of aquifers. As a result, the main finding the present study is that the probability of groundwater quality decline is significant in many aquifers in the country."}{"Prediction of acid rock drainage in waste rock piles Part 1: Water film model for geochemical reactions and application to a full-scale case study ": "Geochemical reactions taking place at the rock surface and pore water interface, and rapid preferential water flow through waste rock piles are identified as two primary steps for acid rock drainage (ARD) and metal leaching (ML) processes. This paper (Part I) develops a water film model to describe the interactions among sulphide minerals, pore water and oxygen, which considers the reactive surface areas as the primary sites to capture geochemical reactions including sulphide oxidation and neutralization reactions, and also considers acid and metal ion storage in pore water. In addition, the proposed water film model is further coupled with a pile-scale mass transport model to investigate a specific case of the main waste rock pile at the Equity Silver mine, Canada. Overall, the simulated profile of oxygen concentration matches the historical monitoring data. The modeling results revealed potential controlling mechanisms for ARD generation inside the waste rock pile and provided insights into the impact of an engineered cover on the waste rock pile."}{"Applicability of the dual isotopes \u03b415N and \u03b418O to identify nitrate in groundwater beneath irrigated cropland ": "Identification of the nitrate sources that adversely impact groundwater quality is a necessary first step in the control of this major worldwide pollutant. The impact of nitrate leachate from urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) (50% urea-N, 25% ammonium-N, 25% nitrate-N) fertilizer, whose use has increased dramatically in the last three decades largely because it can be applied through sprinkler irrigation systems to corn in all growth stages, is investigated. The dual isotopes \u03b415NNO3 and \u03b418ONO3 were measured in groundwater samples from 39 irrigation wells in two intensively sprinkler-irrigated, corn-growing areas of Nebraska with nitrate-contaminated (N\u202f>\u202f10\u202fmg/L) groundwater and documented UAN use to ascertain whether nitrified ammonia and nitrate fertilizers can be distinguished in the High Plains aquifer. The areas, which are highly vulnerable to nitrate leaching and differ only in the composition and thickness of their unsaturated zones, are uniquely suited to provide scientific evidence of the feasibility of identifying nitrate fertilizer leachate in groundwater and thereby add significantly to the small body of existing and inconclusive data. The dual isotope method (DIM) results indicate that the nitrate contamination in 38 wells is mostly nitrified ammonium fertilizer. Most importantly, nitrate fertilizer from UAN was not identified isotopically in groundwater beneath almost all fields with documented heavy UAN use. This could be a potentially valuable finding for fertilizer management or it could convey limitations on the appropriateness of the DIM for nitrate fertilizer source identification in groundwater. Slightly enriched \u03b415NNO3 values in a few wells coincide with the practice of wintering cattle on corn stubble, which reportedly occurred more frequently in one focus area. The absence of natural soil-N leachates and denitrification in groundwater enabled an apparently reliable identification of manure leachates in both areas."}{"Water purification by using Adsorbents: A Review ": "There are number of water purification techniques but the adsorption is one of the most simplest, effective and economical method for wastewater purification.

Majority of its energy demand is going to be fulfill by coal based power plants. The country is heavily reliant on coal used as a primary fuel in power plant. However, the use of coal at higher level polluting the environment in a continuous manner. Alone, India\u2019s power sector is responsible for half of all CO2 emission in the nation and therefore a serious attention is required in this direction to reduce (GHG) emissions in the environment. Presently, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) act as a bridging technology and a viable option for coal fired power plants to extract CO2. But, still in India the adoption of CCS in coal fired power plant is poor. In UNFCCCs Paris Summit, India committed to reduce its carbon intensity by 30%\u201333% by 2030. The present study deals with the scenario of CCS with various challenges and its implementation efforts in India."}{"Mechanistic understanding and future prospect of microbe-enhanced phytoremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil ": "Restoring polluted land is a time-consuming endeavor due to the difficulty inherent in the process. The quality of soil considerably worsens with the addition of toxic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of industrial origin. Industrialization results in millions of tonnes of POPs worldwide, which pose a threat to surrounding ecosystems. In India alone, oil refineries generate approximately 28,000 tonnes of oily sludge (toxic organic compounds) per annum containing POPs\u2014polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These PAHs have existed in environments throughout the globe for the last several decades due to long half-lives. The fate of PAHs and their residues pose a threat to all forms of life.

In the preparation, a binder was added to a mixture of natural bentonite and melted urea. Then, the admixture was put into a mould and extruded to obtain SRUF in the form of pellets. The SRUF was dried at 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 8\u00a0h before use. Urea desorption mechanisms of the SRUF was examined through static release experiments. The structural properties of SRUF was characterized through scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was found from static release experiments that the SRUFs more slowly released urea in water than conventional urea fertilizer. After 500\u00a0min of the experiment, the slowest release of urea was achieved by SRUF using corn starch. Meanwhile, conventional urea fertilizer completely released urea in water after less than 50\u00a0min. Release mechanisms of the SRUF using corn starch and SRUF using HPMC were anomalous transport and Fickian diffusion, respectively."}{"Process optimization of methylene blue adsorption onto eggshell\u2013treated palm oil fuel ash ": "Palm oil fuel ash (POFA) and eggshell (EG) were explored towards efficient methylene blue (MB) removal.

PH are classified as xenobiotics and emerging priority pollutants. When released into the environment, fate and behavior of PH varies widely with the particular composition and physicochemical properties. Usually, PH with higher molecular weight are toxic and seldom mobilizes in subsurface plumes when compared to their low molecular weight counterparts. Due to the toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic nature of PH, various remediation approaches are currently employed for their clean-up from the environment. Degradation of PH by the activity of native microbes is considered as a significant eco-friendly and cost effective approach for the remediation of PH contaminated sites. Changes in the microbial adaptations and dynamics are important indicators for monitoring the effects of PH contamination. Several analytical techniques are available for the identification and quantification of PH present in contaminated sites. Also, toxicity tests are widely employed to monitor the effect of remediated sites where analytical techniques fall short to identify certain PH due to the lack of standardized methods and low concentrations. Consequently, this review provides an overview of environmental fate, toxicity, and remediation of PH with particular emphasis on risk-based remediation which considers the use of both analytical and toxicological studies for effective management and remediation of PH contaminated sites."}{"Food waste matters - A systematic review of household food waste practices and their policy implications ": "In recent years, food waste has received growing interest from local, national and European policymakers, international organisations, NGOs as well as academics from various disciplinary fields. Increasing concerns about food security and environmental impacts, such as resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions attributed to food waste, have intensified attention to the topic. While food waste occurs in all stages of the food supply chain, private households have been identified as key actors in food waste generation. However, the evidence on why food waste occurs remains scattered. This paper maps the still small but expanding academic territory of consumer food waste by systematically reviewing empirical studies on food waste practices as well as distilling factors that foster and impede the generation of food waste on the household level. Moreover, we briefly discuss the contributions of different social ontologies, more particularly psychology-related approaches and social practice theory. The analysis reveals food waste as a complex and multi-faceted issue that cannot be attributed to single variables; this also calls for a stronger integration of different disciplinary perspectives. Mapping the determinants of waste generation deepens the understanding of household practices and helps design food waste prevention strategies. Finally, we link the identified factors with a set of policy, business, and retailer options."}{"Environmental impact of textile reuse and recycling \u2013 A review ": "This paper reviews studies of the environmental impact of textile reuse and recycling, to provide a summary of the current knowledge and point out areas for further research. Forty-one studies were reviewed, whereof 85% deal with recycling and 41% with reuse (27% cover both reuse and recycling). Fibre recycling is the most studied recycling type (57%), followed by polymer/oligomer recycling (37%), monomer recycling (29%), and fabric recycling (14%). Cotton (76%) and polyester (63%) are the most studied materials.\n                  The reviewed publications provide strong support for claims that textile reuse and recycling in general reduce environmental impact compared to incineration and landfilling, and that reuse is more beneficial than recycling. The studies do, however, expose scenarios under which reuse and recycling are not beneficial for certain environmental impacts. For example, as benefits mainly arise due to the avoided production of new products, benefits may not occur in cases with low replacement rates or if the avoided production processes are relatively clean. Also, for reuse, induced customer transport may cause environmental impact that exceeds the benefits of avoided production, unless the use phase is sufficiently extended.\n                  In terms of critical methodological assumptions, authors most often assume that textiles sent to recycling are wastes free of environmental burden, and that reused products and products made from recycled materials replace products made from virgin fibres. Examples of other content mapped in the review are: trends of publications over time, common aims and geographical scopes, commonly included and omitted impact categories, available sources of primary inventory data, knowledge gaps and future research needs. The latter include the need to study cascade systems, to explore the potential of combining various reuse and recycling routes."}{"Sustainable business model innovation: A review ": "The capability to rapidly and successfully move into new business models is an important source of sustainable competitive advantage and a key leverage to improve the sustainability performance of organisations. However, research suggests that many business model innovations fail. Despite the importance of the topic, the reasons for failure are relatively unexplored, and there is no comprehensive review of the sustainable business model innovation literature. This research provides a review of the literature, using a systematic database search and cross-reference snowballing. Its key contributions are: (1) a review of the key underlying concepts, discussing their similarities and differences and offer new definitions where there is an identified need; (2) we identify a research gap; and (3) we deduct research questions to address the gap."}{"The role of transformation in learning and education for sustainability ": "Education research has acknowledged the value of transformation, which offers an opportunity for researching and rethinking how appropriate and successful educational practices may be. However, despite the role of transformation in higher education and particularly in sustainability learning, there is a paucity of studies which examine the extent to which transformation and learning on matters related to sustainable development may be integrated.\n                  Based on this perceived research need, the purpose of this article is to present how transformation in learning in education for sustainability requires the commitment of Faculty and the engament of students. To do this, a set of qualitative case studies were used in higher education institutions across seven countries (Brazil, Serbia, Latvia, South Africa, Spain, Syria, UK). The findings revealed that the concept of education for sustainable development has not been sufficiently integrated into the concept of transformation in higher education institutions. It also found that to enhance sustainability in the curricula, academics should develop collaborative approaches, and discuss how to redesign their own disciplines, and how to appreciate the epistemology and multicultural vision of sustainability, both as a topic, and as a field of education research. It was further found that reflections of the academics on their own values are crucial for developing the transformative potential of students as agents of a sustainable future. It is necessary that universities should transform to serve as models of social justice and environmental stewardship, and to foster sustainability learning."}{"Effects of feedstock on larval development and process efficiency in waste treatment with black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) ": "Global population growth has led to an urgent need for more efficient food production systems. Moreover, as income levels increase, dietary preferences are shifting to more animal-based products. However, current feed protein sources deplete wild fish populations and contribute to rainforest deforestation. Capturing the resources in organic waste could help alleviate environmental impacts of food production. The larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) are ferocious feeders on decomposing organic material and could be used as protein source in animal feed. This study evaluated development of black soldier fly larvae on eight urban organic waste fractions and two control substrates. Principal component analysis was conducted to identify substrate properties that contributed to treatment efficiency and larval development. The main treatment factors found to be affected by substrate were waste-to-biomass conversion ratio, larval development time and final prepupal weight. The substrate properties with the greatest impact on biomass conversion ratio and larval development time were content of total volatile solids and protein content, while only total volatile solids content affected final prepupal weight. It was concluded that black soldier fly larvae are versatile in their feedstock preferences and can be used to treat a variety of organic waste streams, provided that the total volatile solids and nitrogen content are sufficiently high to support larval development. Abattoir waste, food waste, human faeces and a mixture of abattoir waste \u2013 fruits & vegetables are waste streams that are highly suitable for fly larvae treatment."}{"How are cities planning to respond to climate change? Assessment of local climate plans from 885 cities in the EU-28 ": "The Paris Agreement aims to limit global mean temperature rise this century to well below 2\u202f\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This target has wide-ranging implications for Europe and its cities, which are the source of substantial greenhouse gas emissions. This paper reports the state of local planning for climate change by collecting and analysing information about local climate mitigation and adaptation plans across 885 urban areas of the EU-28. A typology and framework for analysis was developed that classifies local climate plans in terms of their alignment with spatial (local, national and international) and other climate related policies. Out of eight types of local climate plans identified in total we document three types of stand-alone local climate plans classified as type A1 (autonomously produced plans), A2 (plans produced to comply with national regulations) or A3 (plans developed for international climate networks). There is wide variation among countries in the prevalence of local climate plans, with generally more plans developed by central and northern European cities. Approximately 66% of EU cities have a type A1, A2, or A3 mitigation plan, 26% an adaptation plan, and 17% a joint adaptation and mitigation plan, while about 33% lack any form of stand-alone local climate plan (i.e. what we classify as A1, A2, A3 plans). Mitigation plans are more numerous than adaptation plans, but planning for mitigation does not always precede planning for adaptation. Our analysis reveals that city size, national legislation, and international networks can influence the development of local climate plans. We found that size does matter as about 80% of the cities with above 500,000 inhabitants have a comprehensive and stand-alone mitigation and/or an adaptation plan (A1). Cities in four countries with national climate legislation (A2), i.e. Denmark, France, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, are nearly twice as likely to produce local mitigation plans, and five times more likely to produce local adaptation plans, compared to cities in countries without such legislation. A1 and A2 mitigation plans are particularly numerous in Denmark, Poland, Germany, and Finland; while A1 and A2 adaptation plans are prevalent in Denmark, Finland, UK and France. The integration of adaptation and mitigation is country-specific and can mainly be observed in two countries where local climate plans are compulsory, i.e. France and the UK. Finally, local climate plans produced for international climate networks (A3) are mostly found in the many countries where autonomous (type A1) plans are less common. This is the most comprehensive analysis of local climate planning to date. The findings are of international importance as they will inform and support decision-making towards climate planning and policy development at national, EU and global level being based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge of local climate planning available to date."}{"Food packaging in the circular economy: Overview of chemical safety aspects for commonly used materials ": "Food packaging facilitates storage, handling, transport, and preservation of food and is essential for preventing food waste. Besides these beneficial properties, food packaging causes rising concern for the environment due to its high production volume, often short usage time, and problems related to waste management and littering. Reduction, reuse, and recycling, but also redesign support the aims of the circular economy. These tools also have the potential to decrease the environmental impact of food packaging.\n                  In this article, we focus on chemical safety aspects of recycled food packaging, as recycling is currently seen as an important measure to manage packaging waste. However, recycling may increase the levels of potentially hazardous chemicals in the packaging and -after migration- in the food. Since exposure to certain chemicals migrating from food packaging has been associated with chronic diseases, it is of high importance to assess the safety of recycled packaging. Therefore, we describe recycling processes of commonly used food packaging materials, including plastics, paper and board, aluminum, steel, and multimaterial multilayers (e.g., beverage cartons). Further, we give an overview of typical migrants from all types of recycled food packaging materials, and summarize approaches to reduce chemical contamination. We discuss the role of food packaging in the circular economy, where recycling is only one of many complementary tools for providing environmentally-friendly and safe food packaging."}{"Fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars - An analysis of learning rates, user costs, and costs for mitigating CO2 and air pollutant emissions ": "This article presents experience curves and cost-benefit analyses for electric and plug-in hybrid cars sold in Germany. We find that between 2010 and 2016, the prices and price differentials relative to conventional cars declined at learning rates of 23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2% and 32\u202f\u00b1\u202f2% for electric cars and 6\u202f\u00b1\u202f1% and 37\u202f\u00b1\u202f2% for plug-in hybrids. If trends persist, price beak-even with conventional cars may be reached after another 7\u202f\u00b1\u202f1 million electric cars and 5\u202f\u00b1\u202f1 million plug-in hybrids are produced. The user costs of electric and plug-in hybrid cars relative to their conventional counterparts are declining annually by 14% and 26%. Also the costs for mitigating CO2 and air pollutant emissions through the deployment of electrified cars tend to decline. However, at current levels, NOX and particle emissions are still mitigated at lower costs by state-of-the-art after-treatment systems than through the electrification of powertrains. Overall, the observation of robust technological learning suggests policy makers should focus their support on non-cost market barriers for the electrification of road transport, addressing specifically the availability of recharging infrastructure."}{"Indoor air humidity, air quality, and health \u2013 An overview ": "There is a long-standing dispute about indoor air humidity and perceived indoor air quality (IAQ) and associated health effects. Complaints about sensory irritation in eyes and upper airways are generally among top-two symptoms together with the perception \u201cdry air\u201d in office environments. This calls for an integrated analysis of indoor air humidity and eye and airway health effects. This overview has reviewed the literature about the effects of extended exposure to low humidity on perceived IAQ, sensory irritation symptoms in eyes and airways, work performance, sleep quality, virus survival, and voice disruption. Elevation of the indoor air humidity may positively impact perceived IAQ, eye symptomatology, and possibly work performance in the office environment; however, mice inhalation studies do not show exacerbation of sensory irritation in the airways by low humidity. Elevated humidified indoor air appears to reduce nasal symptoms in patients suffering from obstructive apnea syndrome, while no clear improvement on voice production has been identified, except for those with vocal fatigue. Both low and high RH, and perhaps even better absolute humidity (water vapor), favors transmission and survival of influenza virus in many studies, but the relationship between temperature, humidity, and the virus and aerosol dynamics is complex, which in the end depends on the individual virus type and its physical/chemical properties. Dry and humid air perception continues to be reported in offices and in residential areas, despite the IAQ parameter \u201cdry air\u201d (or \u201cwet/humid air\u201d) is semantically misleading, because a sensory organ for humidity is non-existing in humans. This IAQ parameter appears to reflect different perceptions among other odor, dustiness, and possibly exacerbated by desiccation effect of low air humidity.\n                  It is salient to distinguish between indoor air humidity (relative or absolute) near the breathing and ocular zone and phenomena caused by moisture-damage of the building construction and emissions therefrom. Further, residential versus public environments should be considered as separate entities with different characteristics and demands of humidity. Research is needed about particle, bacteria and virus dynamics indoors for improvement of quality of life and with more focus on the impact of absolute humidity. \u201cDry (or wet) air\u201d should be redefined to become a meaningful IAQ descriptor."}{"A Faecal Contamination Index for interpreting heterogeneous diarrhoea impacts of water, sanitation and hygiene interventions and overall, regional and country estimates of community sanitation coverage with a focus on low- and middle-income countries ": "Objectives\n                  The impact on diarrhoea of sanitation interventions has been heterogeneous. We hypothesize that this is due to the level of prevailing faecal environmental contamination and propose a Faecal Contamination Index (FAECI) of selected WASH indicators (objective 1). Additionally, we provide estimates of the proportion of the population living in communities above certain sanitation coverage levels (objective 2).\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  \n                     Objective 1: Faecal contamination post-intervention was estimated from WASH intervention reports. WASH indicators composing the FAECI included eight water, sanitation and hygiene practice indicators, which were selected for their relevance for health and data availability at study- and country-level. The association between the estimated level of faecal environmental contamination and diarrhoea was examined using meta-regression. Objective 2: A literature search was conducted to identify health-relevant community sanitation coverage thresholds. To estimate total community coverage with basic sanitation in low- and middle-income countries, at relevant thresholds, household surveys with data available at primary sampling unit (PSU)-level were analysed according to the identified thresholds, at country-, regional- and overall level.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  \n                     Objective 1: We found a non-linear association between estimated environmental faecal contamination and sanitation interventions\u2019 impact on diarrhoeal disease. Diarrhoea reductions were highest at lower faecal contamination levels, and no diarrhoea reduction was found when contamination increased above a certain level. Objective 2: Around 45% of the population lives in communities with more than 75% of coverage with basic sanitation and 24% of the population lives in communities above 95% coverage, respectively.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  High prevailing faecal contamination might explain interventions' poor effectiveness in reducing diarrhoea. The here proposed Faecal Contamination Index is a first attempt to estimate the level of faecal contamination in communities. Much of the world's population currently lives in faecally contaminated environments as indicated by low community sanitation coverage."}{"Towards 5G communication systems: Are there health implications? ": "The spread of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) is rising and health effects are still under investigation. RF-EMF promote oxidative stress, a condition involved in cancer onset, in several acute and chronic diseases and in vascular homeostasis. Although some evidences are still controversial, the WHO IARC classified RF-EMF as \u201cpossible carcinogenic to humans\u201d, and more recent studies suggested reproductive, metabolic and neurologic effects of RF-EMF, which are also able to alter bacterial antibiotic resistance. In this evolving scenario, although the biological effects of 5G communication systems are very scarcely investigated, an international action plan for the development of 5G networks has started, with a forthcoming increment in devices and density of small cells, and with the future use of millimeter waves (MMW). Preliminary observations showed that MMW increase skin temperature, alter gene expression, promote cellular proliferation and synthesis of proteins linked with oxidative stress, inflammatory and metabolic processes, could generate ocular damages, affect neuro-muscular dynamics. Further studies are needed to better and independently explore the health effects of RF-EMF in general and of MMW in particular. However, available findings seem sufficient to demonstrate the existence of biomedical effects, to invoke the precautionary principle, to define exposed subjects as potentially vulnerable and to revise existing limits. An adequate knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms linking RF-EMF exposure to health risk should also be useful in the current clinical practice, in particular in consideration of evidences pointing to extrinsic factors as heavy contributors to cancer risk and to the progressive epidemiological growth of noncommunicable diseases."}{"Burden of climate change on malaria mortality ": "In 2016, an estimated 445,000 deaths and 216 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide, while 70% of the deaths occurred in children under five years old. Changes in climatic exposures such as temperature and precipitation make malaria one of the most climate sensitive outcomes. Using a global malaria mortality dataset for 105 countries between 1980 and 2010, we find a non-linear relationship between temperature and malaria mortality and estimate that the global optimal temperature threshold beyond which all-age malaria mortality increases is 20.8\u202f\u00b0C, while in the case of child mortality; a significantly lower optimum temperature of 19.3\u00b0 is estimated. Our results also suggest that this optimal temperature is 28.4\u202f\u00b0C and 26.3\u202f\u00b0C in Africa and Asia, respectively \u2013 the continents where malaria is most prevalent. Furthermore, we estimate that child mortality (ages 0\u20134) is likely to increase by up to 20% in some areas due to climate change by the end of the 21st century."}{"Environmental conditions in health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries: Coverage and inequalities ": "Safe environmental conditions and the availability of standard precaution items are important to prevent and treat infection in health care facilities (HCFs) and to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets for health and water, sanitation, and hygiene. Baseline coverage estimates for HCFs have yet to be formed for the SDGs; and there is little evidence describing inequalities in coverage. To address this, we produced the first coverage estimates of environmental conditions and standard precaution items in HCFs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); and explored factors associated with low coverage. Data from monitoring reports and peer-reviewed literature were systematically compiled; and information on conditions, service levels, and inequalities tabulated. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with low coverage. Data for 21 indicators of environmental conditions and standard precaution items were compiled from 78 LMICs which were representative of 129,557 HCFs. 50% of HCFs lack piped water, 33% lack improved sanitation, 39% lack handwashing soap, 39% lack adequate infectious waste disposal, 73% lack sterilization equipment, and 59% lack reliable energy services. Using nationally representative data from six countries, 2% of HCFs provide all four of water, sanitation, hygiene, and waste management services. Statistically significant inequalities in coverage exist between HCFs by: urban-rural setting, managing authority, facility type, and sub-national administrative unit. We identified important, previously undocumented inequalities and environmental health challenges faced by HCFs in LMICs. The information and analyses provide evidence for those engaged in improving HCF conditions to develop evidence-based policies and efficient programs, enhance service delivery systems, and make better use of available resources."}{"Pathogens transmitted in animal feces in low- and middle-income countries ": "Animals found in close proximity to humans in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) harbor many pathogens capable of infecting humans, transmissible via their feces. Contact with animal feces poses a currently unquantified\u2014though likely substantial\u2014risk to human health. In LMIC settings, human exposure to animal feces may explain some of the limited success of recent water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions that have focused on limiting exposure to human excreta, with less attention to containing animal feces.\n                  We conducted a review to identify pathogens that may substantially contribute to the global burden of disease in humans through their spread in animal feces in the domestic environment in LMICs. Of the 65 potentially pathogenic organisms considered, 15 were deemed relevant, based on burden of disease and potential for zoonotic transmission. Of these, five were considered of highest concern based on a substantial burden of disease for which transmission in animal feces is potentially important: Campylobacter, non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), Lassa virus, Cryptosporidium, and Toxoplasma gondii. Most of these have a wide range of animal hosts, except Lassa virus, which is spread through the feces of rats indigenous to sub-Saharan Africa. Combined, these five pathogens cause close to one million deaths annually. More than half of these deaths are attributed to invasive NTS. We do not estimate an overall burden of disease from improperly managed animal feces in LMICs, because it is unknown what proportion of illnesses caused by these pathogens can be attributed to contact with animal feces.\n                  Typical water quantity, water quality, and handwashing interventions promoted in public health and development address transmission routes for both human and animal feces; however, sanitation interventions typically focus on containing human waste, often neglecting the residual burden of disease from pathogens transmitted via animal feces. This review compiles evidence on which pathogens may contribute to the burden of disease through transmission in animal feces; these data will help prioritize intervention types and regions that could most benefit from interventions aimed at reducing human contact with animal feces."}{"The effectiveness of respiratory protection worn by communities to protect from volcanic ash inhalation. Part I: Filtration efficiency tests ": "During volcanic eruptions and their aftermath, communities may be concerned about the impacts of inhaling volcanic ash. Access to effective respiratory protection (RP) is therefore important for many people in volcanic areas all over the world. However, evidence to support the use of effective RP during such crises is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to build the first evidence base on the effectiveness of common materials used to protect communities from ash inhalation in volcanic crises.\n                  We obtained 17 forms of RP, covering various types of cloth through to disposable masks (typically used in occupational settings), which communities are known to wear during volcanic crises. The RP materials were characterised and subjected to filtration efficiency (FE) tests, which were performed with three challenge dusts: ashes from Sakurajima (Japan) and Soufri\u00e8re Hills (Montserrat) volcanoes and aluminium oxide (Aloxite), chosen as a low-toxicity surrogate dust of similar particle size distribution. FE tests were conducted at two concentrations (1.5\u202fmg/m3 and 2.5\u202fmg/m3) and two flow rates (equivalent to 40 and 80\u202fl/min through 15.9\u202fcm2 sections of each RP type). Each material was held in a sample holder and PM2.5 dust concentrations were measured both outside the mask material and inside the sample holder to determine FE. A limited number of tests were undertaken to assess the effect on FE of wetting a bandana and a surgical mask, as well as folding a bandana to provide multiple filter layers.\n                  Overall, four RP materials performed very well against volcanic ash, with median FEs in excess of 98% (N95-equiv., N99-equiv., PM2.5 surgical (Japan), and Basic flat-fold (Indonesia)). The two standard surgical masks tested had median FEs of 89\u201391%. All other materials had median FEs ranging from 23 to 76% with no cloth materials achieving >44%. Folding a bandana resulted in better FE (40%; 3\u00d7 folded) than single-layered material (29%). Wetting the bandana and surgical mask material did not improve FE overall.\n                  This first evidence base on the FE of common materials used to protect communities in volcanic crises from ash inhalation has been extended in a companion study (Steinle et al., 2018) on the total inward leakage of the best-performing masks when worn by human volunteers. This will provide a complete assessment of the effectiveness of these RP types."}
