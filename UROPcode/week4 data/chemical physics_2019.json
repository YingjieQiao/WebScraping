{"On a chlorophyll-caroteinoid coupling in LHCII ": "Higher plants have evolved elaborate mechanisms to fine-tune their photosynthetic activity for the optimal yield under low light and at the same time they cope with its fluctuations. Proposals in the literature have indicated that a specific chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)/carotenoid (Car) pair within the major light harvesting complex (LHCII) of photosystem II can play the role of a quencher in terms of energy transfer between the \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 Q\n                              \n                              \n                                 y\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                      state of Chl-a to the short-lived dark S1 state of the carotenoid. For the respective coupling calculation, we employ the TrESP approach (transition charge from electrostatic potential) which needs atomic transition charges as input. In this study, we determine these charges using different quantum chemical approaches as well as compare to existing data. Furthermore, the excitonic couplings for the Chl-a/Car pair are determined along molecular dynamics trajectories and the results are discussed in terms of varying pH and ionic strengths."}{"Perspective on sum frequency generation spectroscopy of ice surfaces and interfaces ": "This perspective is focused on surfaces and interfaces of crystalline ice studied with sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy by several research groups within these twenty years. The intrinsic interface selectivity of SFG has already enabled one to determine structural aspects of the ice surfaces and interfaces through vibrational signatures of the OH stretch. Here we describe why SFG is suitable for ice surface science and how SFG has revealed the structure and dynamics of dangling bonds, quasi-liquid layer, hydrogen-bond network, and ordered protons at the ice surfaces, ice/substrate interfaces, and ice films on metal surfaces. In particular, we compare SFG spectra of ice reported by different groups to examine consistency between their experiments. We elaborate current controversies on a few SFG studies of ice before presenting future outlook for ice surface science by SFG. Additionally in the appendix we briefly explain some technical issues that may help us resolve conflicts and make progress in the right way."}{"Charge carrier dynamics study and morphology optimization in solvent annealed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite for air processed stable solar cell application ": "We report room temperature excitation intensity dependent charge carrier dynamics in solvent-annealed organo-metal halide perovskite semiconductor CH3NH3PbI3 thin film using steady state and time resolved photoluminescence studies. The average lifetime of these solvent annealed films does not vary significantly with excitation fluence confirming the formation of almost defect free perovskite crystallites. The photocarrier dynamics are well described by a simple rate equation. The local reduction of shallow trap densities as observed in PL dynamics was correlated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray spectroscopy. The observed photophysical investigation and morphology study suggests that anti-solvent method as a potential approach for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell fabrication under ambient condition. A prototype all air processed anti-solvent method based stable perovskite device yielded the efficiency of 7.54% with JSC value of 14.21\u202fmA/cm2 and VOC of 810\u202fmV."}{"Strain and electric field tunable electronic properties of type-II band alignment in van der Waals GaSe/MoSe2 heterostructure ": "Constructing van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) based on different two-dimensional materials could afford many interesting properties, which may not hold for single-layered materials. In this study, we design a novel vdWH-GaSe/MoSe2 and investigate its electronic properties using first-principles calculations. It has a type-II band alignment with an indirect bandgap. Moreover, we found that the band alignment transformation of the GaSe/MoSe2 vdWH from type-II to type-I can be realized by decreasing the interlayer distance or by applying a positive electric field. Our findings could provide fundamental insights into the GaSe/MoSe2 vdWH for designing high-performance optoelectronic nanodevices."}{"Visualising the role of non-perturbative environment dynamics in the dissipative generation of coherent electronic motion ": "Targeted exciton transport is crucial for efficient light-harvesting, but its microscopic description in biological systems is complicated by strong environmental coupling, highly structured vibrational environments and non-Markovian open system dynamics. In this article we employ the non-perturbative hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) technique to explore how structured environments and tuned electronic properties can lead to the generation of coherent motion across a directed transport network, i.e. one containing an energy gradient. By further exploiting the information contained in the auxiliary HEOM matrices, we also visualize the complete displacement distributions of the main reaction coordinate during the ultrafast relaxation, and show that highly non-Gaussian profiles emerge when the electronic dynamics become quasi-reversible and involve bath-induced delocalized states. These coherent dynamics are spontaneously generated by earlier incoherent relaxation events, and we also demonstrate the correlation between the environmental coordinates and a quantitative volume-based measure of non-Markovianity."}{"One-step hydrothermal synthesis of SnO2-MoS2 composite heterostructure for improved visible light photocatalytic performance ": "The formation of a heterostructure in a photocatalyst is considered to be an effective method for improving photocatalytic performance. In this paper, the SnO2-MoS2 heterostructures are synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The structure, composition and morphology of the samples are characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, (HR)TEM, and Raman spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performance of the samples are judged by the degradation of two dyes, i.e., methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB), under visible light. The photocatalytic performance of all composite samples is better than that of pure MoS2 or SnO2. In particular, 60% SnO2-MoS2 has the best photocatalytic performance, which is characterized by its large degradation rate to pollutants and excellent reusability. The high-efficiency photocatalytic activity of the SnO2-MoS2 heterostructure is due to the high specific surface area and enhanced absorption of visible light in its composite structure, which effectively improves the separation of electron-hole pairs."}{"Titanium dioxide-molybdenum disulfide for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue ": "Photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) was performed using titanium dioxide and molybdenum disulfide (TiO2-MoS2) composites. TiO2-MoS2 composites were synthesized using the sol-gel method. By weight, the ratio of MoS2 to TiO2 was varied from 3:5 to 9:5. The composites showed better photocatalytic degradation of MB compared to pure TiO2 under irradiation of ultraviolet light, and the 7:5 ratio (which was labelled S3) provides the best photodegradation efficiency for MB. TiO2 degraded MB under 180\u202fmin while S3 degraded MB under 80\u202fmin. The photocurrent response of pure TiO2 was 0.55\u202f\u00b5A, but was increased to 20.08\u202f\u00b5A (S3) after the addition of MoS2. The electrochemical results reveal that the introduction of MoS2 into TiO2 improves the electronic conductivity and the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in higher photocatalytic behavior in the decomposition of methylene blue."}{"Structural, optical and photocatalytic studies of Zn doped MoO3 nanobelts ": "In this study, we report a synthesis of nanobelts-form zinc (Zn) doped molybdenum oxide (MoO3) with different weight percentages (2%, 3.3%, 4%, and 5%).

To place this finding on a firmer ground, we investigate the relativistic quantum fingerprints of classical chaos using the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). OTOC has recently been applied to a number of fields in physics and it holds special promises for the field of quantum chaos, but existing work focused exclusively on nonrelativistic quantum systems. Calculating and analyzing OTOC for relativistic quantum billiard systems described by the massless Dirac equation, we find that the signatures of classical chaos are indeed characteristically less pronounced in relativistic than in nonrelativistic quantum systems. The finding is substantiated by studying four different aspects of OTOC. Firstly, in the energy eigenspace, in the short time regime there is a complete lack of any signature of chaos associated with the evolution of OTOC in the Dirac billiard due to the relativistic quantum phenomenon of Zitterbewegung, in contrast to nonrelativistic quantum billiard systems where chaos leaves behind a quite distinct signature. Secondly, weakening of the relativistic quantum manifestations of classical chaos occurs in the long time regime as well. Thirdly, evolution of the wave packet based OTOC also reveals that the fingerprints of chaos are much less pronounced in the Dirac billiard systems as compared with the Schr\u00f6dinger billiards. Fourthly, the level spacing statistics of the OTOC operators in systems with classically integrable and chaotic dynamics, which are characteristically distinct in the Schr\u00f6dinger billiards, bear a strong similarity in the Dirac billiards, indicating again the dwindling effects of chaos. The OTOC based results suggest that the impacts of classical chaos are generally weaker in relativistic than in nonrelativistic quantum systems, a fundamental issue that warrants further investigation."}{"The role of lipids in aging-related metabolic changes ": "Fat is historically associated with poor health and obesity. However, the continuous use of lipidomics and genetic studies in model organisms revealed that specific lipid profiles and signals might delay aging. In order to identify and quantify the lipid species, researchers are taking advantage of the recent developments in the area of lipidomics that is mainly done by mass spectrometry and further techniques, such as NMR spectroscopy and chromatographic separations.\n                  This review will emphasize the role of lipid composition and metabolism during aging. We review the molecular and physiological changes during the progression of aging with a special focus on the role of lipids. Interventions to modulate life span in a variety of organisms such caloric restriction, show a significant extension of their maximum life-span and a decrease in the onset of age-related diseases. In particular, the influence of dietary restriction in lipid metabolism will be a major point of this review."}{"Behavior of the DPH fluorescence probe in membranes perturbed by drugs ": "1,6-Diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) is one of the most commonly used fluorescent probes to study dynamical and structural properties of lipid bilayers and cellular membranes via measuring steady-state or time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy. In this study, we present a limitation in the use of DPH to predict the order of lipid acyl chains when the lipid bilayer is doped with itraconazole (ITZ), an antifungal drug. Our steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed a significant decrease in fluorescence anisotropy of DPH embedded in the ITZ-containing membrane, suggesting a substantial increase in membrane fluidity, which indirectly indicates a decrease in the order of the hydrocarbon chains. This result or its interpretation is in disagreement with the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. The results of these experiments and calculations indicate an increase in the hydrocarbon chain order. The MD simulations of the bilayer containing both ITZ and DPH provide explanations for these observations. Apparently, in the presence of the drug, the DPH molecules are pushed deeper into the hydrophobic membrane core below the lipid double bonds, and the probe predominately adopts the orientation of the ITZ molecules that is parallel to the membrane surface, instead of orienting parallel to the lipid acyl chains. For this reason, DPH anisotropy provides information related to the less ordered central region of the membrane rather than reporting the properties of the upper segments of the lipid acyl chains."}{"Single-particle cryo-EM studies of transmembrane proteins in SMA copolymer nanodiscs ": "Styrene-maleic acid (SMA) copolymers can extract membrane proteins from native membranes along with lipids as nanodiscs. Preparation with SMA is fast, cost-effective, and captures the native protein-lipid interactions. On the other hand, cryo-EM has become increasingly successful and efficient for structural determinations of membrane proteins, with biochemical sample preparation often the bottleneck. Three recent cryo-EM studies on the efflux transporter AcrB and the alternative complex III: cyt c oxidase supercomplex have demonstrated the potential of SMA nanodisc samples to yield high-resolution structure information of membrane proteins."}{"Mass spectrometry\u2014A versatile tool for characterising the lipid environment of membrane protein assemblies ": "Biological membranes are selectively permeable barriers important for cell organization and compartmentalization. Their organisation strongly depends on the lipids that constitute the lipid bilayer as well as the proteins that reside in the membrane. Unravelling the organisation of biological membranes is therefore of great importance to understand cellular function driven by integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Recent developments in mass spectrometry made it a powerful tool contributing to our present-day understanding of membrane composition and organisation. The two main deliverables of mass spectrometry are (i) the identification and quantification of the membrane components, and (ii) the analysis of their structural arrangements. In this review article, we first briefly discuss the aspects of membrane organization that are accessible through mass spectrometry. We then provide detailed insights into the various mass spectrometric strategies which help identifying lipids from membranes or membrane protein assemblies, unravelling the lipid binding modes in membrane proteins and uncovering their structural roles. We further discuss the growing interest in membrane mimetics providing membrane proteins with a native-like lipid environment for structural and functional studies and the possibilities of mass spectrometry to contribute in these experiments."}{"Instrument response of phosphatidylglycerol lipids with varying fatty acyl chain length in nano-ESI shotgun experiments ": "In recent years, lipid quantification gained importance. In most cases, this is achieved by spiking the lipid mixture with deuterated standard lipids or lipid analogues that differ in chain length when compared with the natural lipid components. Usually, conventional ESI is employed requiring sample amounts which are not always available. Here, we evaluate the use of nano-ESI for accurate lipid quantification employing deuterated as well as short- and odd-fatty acyl chain analogues. We compare ionisation efficiencies of various phosphatidylglycerol species differing in fatty acyl chain length and saturation. While in our instrumental and experimental set-up differences in ionisation could not be observed for lipids varying in the number of double bonds, short-chain lipid species showed significantly higher intensities when compared with their long-chain analogues. To compensate for these differences and enable accurate quantification using short-fatty acyl chain lipid standards, we generated a calibration curve over a range of lipids with increasing chain length. We tested and evaluated the application of this calibration curve by comparison with a deuterated and odd-chain standard lipid for quantification of lipids in a mixture of known composition as well as a natural lipid extract. The different approaches deliver comparable quantities and are therefore applicable for accurate lipid quantification using nano-ESI. Even though generation of calibration curves might be more laborious, it has the advantage that peak overlap with natural lipids is eliminated and broad peak distributions of deuterated standards do not have to be assessed. Furthermore, it allows the calculation of response factors for long- or short-fatty acyl chain analogues when using deuterated or odd-numbered standard lipids for absolute quantification."}{"From polymer chemistry to structural biology: The development of SMA and related amphipathic polymers for membrane protein extraction and solubilisation ": "Nanoparticles assembled with poly(styrene-maleic acid) copolymers, identified in the literature as Lipodisq, SMALPs or Native Nanodisc, are routinely used as membrane mimetics to stabilise protein structures in their native conformation. To date, transmembrane proteins of varying complexity (up to 8 beta strands or 48 alpha helices) and of a range of molecular weights (from 27\u2009kDa up to 500\u2009kDa) have been incorporated into this particle system for structural and functional studies. SMA and related amphipathic polymers have become versatile components of the biochemist\u2019s tool kit for the stabilisation, extraction and structural characterization of membrane proteins by techniques including cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography. Lipodisq formation does not require the use of conventional detergents and thus avoids their associated detrimental consequences. Here the development of this technology, from its fundamental concept and design to the diverse range of experimental methodologies to which it can now be applied, will be reviewed."}{"\u201cRedox lipidomics technology: Looking for a needle in a haystack\u201d ": "Aerobic life is based on numerous metabolic oxidation reactions as well as biosynthesis of oxygenated signaling compounds. Among the latter are the myriads of oxygenated lipids including a well-studied group of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) - octadecanoids, eicosanoids, and docosanoids. During the last two decades, remarkable progress in liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry has led to significant progress in the characterization of oxygenated PUFA-containing phospholipids, thus designating the emergence of a new field of lipidomics, redox lipidomics. Although non-enzymatic free radical reactions of lipid peroxidation have been mostly associated with the aberrant metabolism typical of acute injury or chronic degenerative processes, newly accumulated evidence suggests that enzymatically catalyzed (phospho)lipid oxygenation reactions are essential mechanisms of many physiological pathways. In this review, we discuss a variety of contemporary protocols applicable for identification and quantitative characterization of different classes of peroxidized (phospho)lipids. We describe applications of different types of LCMS for analysis of peroxidized (phospho)lipids, particularly cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolalmines, in two important types of programmed cell death - apoptosis and ferroptosis. We discuss the role of peroxidized phosphatidylserines in phagocytotic signaling. We exemplify the participation of peroxidized neutral lipids, particularly tri-acylglycerides, in immuno-suppressive signaling in cancer. We also consider new approaches to exploring the spatial distribution of phospholipids in the context of their oxidizability by MS imaging, including the latest achievements in high resolution imaging techniques. We present innovative approaches to the interpretation of LC\u2013MS data, including audio-representation analysis. Overall, we emphasize the role of redox lipidomics as a communication language, unprecedented in diversity and richness, through the analysis of peroxidized (phospho)lipids."}{"\u03b1-Synuclein-derived lipoparticles in the study of \u03b1-Synuclein amyloid fibril formation ": "Aggregation of the protein \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1Syn) is of great interest due to its involvement in the pathology of Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, under in vitro conditions \u03b1Syn is very soluble and kinetically stable for extended time periods. As a result, most \u03b1Syn aggregation assays rely on conditions that artificially induce or enhance aggregation, often by introducing rather non-native conditions. It has been shown that \u03b1Syn interacts with membranes and conditions have been identified in which membranes can promote as well as inhibit \u03b1Syn aggregation. It has also been shown that \u03b1Syn has the intrinsic capability to assemble lipid-protein-particles, in a similar way as apolipoproteins can form lipid-bilayer nanodiscs. Here we show that these \u03b1Syn-lipid particles (\u03b1Syn-LiPs) can also effectively induce, accelerate or inhibit \u03b1Syn aggregation, depending on the applied conditions. \u03b1Syn-LiPs therefore provide a general platform and additional tool, complementary to other setups, to study various aspects of \u03b1Syn amyloid fibril formation."}{"Biological effect of protein modifications by lipid peroxidation products ": "The products of lipid peroxidation, resulting from cell metabolism as well as the action of external physical factors and xenobiotics, have a significant impact on cell functions. One of the mechanisms by which lipid peroxidation products influence cells is the formation of adducts with proteins, including enzymes and signaling molecules. This review describes the biological consequences of protein adduct formation with oxidative lipid fragmentation products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), and acrolein, as well as cyclization products including isoprostanes, isoketals, and isolevuglandins. The generation of protein adducts with lipid peroxidation products can stimulate the antioxidant system, which may also possess proinflammatory or proapoptotic effects. However, the role of adducts between lipid peroxidation products and proteins depends on the condition of the cells and can range from the function of cytoprotective activity stimulation, to induction of toxicity involved in the development of degenerative diseases."}{"Long-range excitations in phospholipid membranes ": "We investigated the existence of long-range excitations and correlated structures in phospholipid membranes by means of grazing-incidence neutron spin echo spectroscopy, grazing-incidence small-angle neutron scattering, and corresponding theoretical calculations inspired by smectic-membrane theory. All these methods confirmed the existence of thermal excitations in the plane of the surface of the phospholipid membranes or the corresponding structures, respectively. Also, these measurements revealed a temperature dependence of these excitations. These excitations are associated with 100\u202fnm in-plane correlations around physiological temperatures and of 75\u202fnm at 16\u202f\u00b0C. A single excitation has an energy around the \u03bceV-regime. A temperature series revealed a high abundance at physiological temperatures and pronounced long-range in-plane structures, which are strongly suppressed at temperatures below 20\u202f\u00b0C. From the length-scales and energy transfers involved we surmise that these excitations may play a role in several functions of the cell membranes such as stability and energy dissipation along the membrane. From a fundamental point of view, the observed behavior of those excitations is congruent with that of a quasi-particle (surface mode phonon, smomon) that exists in the plane of phospholipid membranes."}{"Polymer nanodiscs: Advantages and limitations ": "There is considerable interest in the development of membrane mimetics to study the structure, dynamics and function of membrane proteins. Polymer nanodiscs have been useful as a membrane mimetic by not only providing a native-like membrane environment, but also have the ability to extract the desired membrane protein directly from the cell membrane. In spite of such great potential, polymer nanodiscs have their disadvantages including lack of size control and instability at low pH and with divalent metals. In this review, we discuss how these limitations have been overcome by simple modifications of synthetic polymers commonly used to form nanodiscs. Recently, size control has been achieved using an ethanolamine functionalization of a low molecular weight polymer. This size control enabled the use of polymer-based lipid-nanodiscs in solution NMR and macro-nanodiscs in solid-state NMR applications. The introduction of quaternary ammonium functional groups has been shown to improve the stability in the presence of low pH and divalent metal ions, forming highly monodispersed nanodiscs. The polymer charge has been shown to play a significant role on the reconstitution of membrane proteins due to the high charge density on the nanodisc\u2019s belt. These recent developments have expanded the applications of polymer nanodiscs to study the membrane proteins using wide variety of techniques including NMR, Cryo-EM and other biophysical techniques."}{"Insight into restructuring of Pd-Au nanoparticles using EXAFS ": "We acquired Pd K-edge and Au L3-edge EXAFS spectra of two libraries of titania-supported Pd-doped Au nanoparticle catalysts representing the as-prepared and post-catalysis state. The nanoparticles have narrow particle size distributions, in the range 2.8\u20136.6\u202fnm, and were synthesized to preferentially locate the palladium atoms on the surface of a gold core, with Pd mole fractions of 1.4\u201338%. EXAFS spectra of both the as-prepared samples and post-catalysis Pd-Au particles were collected and modeled. EXAFS refinement of all samples showed contributions from both Pd-Au and Pd-Pd scattering paths, revealing that Pd and Au components alloyed together. Pd was in a partially oxidized state as evidenced by a Pd-O scattering contribution, unlike Au. Overlaying measured coordination numbers from the libraries with predicted values, using models of surface and bulk alloying, showed that Pd restructures among Au as a result of exposure to the reaction conditions."}{"Synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles by ionizing radiation \u2013 a review ": "Various methods of nanoparticle syntheses using ionizing radiation exist nowadays. The synthesis often proceeds in aqueous solutions and therefore the core principle lies in the radiolysis of water and subsequent reactions of formed intermediates with dissolved compounds. There is a noticeable variety of inorganic nanoscale materials prepared by radiation methods, mostly using gamma or accelerated electron irradiation. This review summarizes the radiation induced syntheses of numerous nano-sized compounds, including metals, metal alloys and core-shell systems, metal oxides, carbonates, sulfides, etc., nanomaterials on supports, various heterostructures and nanocomposites. Many of these compounds feature various enhanced properties related to their small size, when compared to bulk materials. Size of the prepared particles vary from subnanometric to several tens of nm and the morphology can be fine-tuned by dose, dose rate and the composition of irradiated solutions."}{"Optimizing vertical profile measurements setup of gamma ray attenuation ": ":\n               \n                  For undisturbed measurements of material properties, the gamma ray attenuation (GRA) method is a commonly used approach, e.g. in soil sciences. So far, various setups of the GRA method are applied depending on specific purposes. For accurate measurements, statistical error due to radioactive decay must be considered. In addition, a careful setting of the further involved parameters such as collimator size, the distance between source and detector as well as the measuring time need to be taken into account. In this study, a method to optimize GRA measurements is presented by relating measuring time and collimator selection to the statistical error of radiation. As a result, a method for choosing the optimum collimator size and a mathematical equation for optimizing the measuring time are derived, which is helpful for planning the vertical profile measurement in terms of required time and spatial resolution."}{"Simultaneous hydrogel crosslinking and silver nanoparticle formation by using ionizing radiation to obtain antimicrobial hydrogels ": "Hydrogel dressings are crosslinked hydrophilic polymers able of swelling in presence of water and can be used in many different types of wound care. In turn, in wound care, silver has been used for a long time as an effective antimicrobial agent. Recent studies have demonstrated an increase of its antimicrobial action when it is used at nanometer scale, that is, as silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which have anti-inflammatory effect on infected wounds, rashes, and mesh skin grafts. The objective of this work was to study hydrogel dressings containing AgNPs from silver nitrate, synthesized by radiation involving the formation of silver nanoparticles with simultaneous occurrence of crosslinking and sterilization of the polymer systems. One of the hydrogels was prepared with poly(N-vinyl-2- pyrrolidone) (PVP) and the other with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as main studied polymers. An aqueous solution of AgNO3 was added to both polymer systems separately. The AgNPs synthesis, polymer crosslinking and dressing sterilization were achieved simultaneously by irradiating the resultant solutions with gamma-rays from a 60Co source. Gel fraction, swelling in reverse osmosis water, SEM-EDS, UV-visible spectroscopy, and antimicrobial activity were performed and characterized. The obtained results showed that the dressings have a soft consistency, high degree of crosslinking and swelling, homogeneous distribution of AgNPs with peaks of plasmonic bands about 400\u202fnm, but only PVP hydrogel showed antimicrobial properties to P. aeruginosa and normal S. aureus. Moreover, this hydrogel also showed antimicrobial properties to S. aureus strain multiresistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones, and aminoglycosides, whereas the PVA hydrogel showed antimicrobial properties to P. aeruginosa and bacteriostatic activity to S. aureus. The results suggest that both synthesized dressings have potential for use in wounds and burns infected with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria."}{"Photon energy response of LiF:Mg,Ti (MTS) and LiF:Mg,Cu,P (MCP) thermoluminescent detectors: Experimental measurements and microdosimetric modeling ": "The photon energy response of six thermoluminescent detector types (6LiF:Mg,Ti, 7LiF:Mg,Ti, natLiF:Mg,Ti, 6LiF:Mg,Cu,P, 7LiF:Mg,Cu,P and natLiF:Mg,Cu,P) was studied in the energy range 12\u20131250\u202fkeV by means of irradiations with different \u03b3-ray sources and X-rays. As expected, for both LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors, no significant differences were found between the results of detectors with same dopant concentrations but different lithium isotopic enrichment. On the other hand, the type and concentration of dopants influence the photon energy response of the detectors up to 50%. The obtained results were compared with experimental data from literature showing good agreement. In addition, the recently developed Microdosimetric d(z) Model was employed to assess the photon response of these detectors. For microdosimetric calculations performed in the optimal site size of 40\u202fnm (determined in previous investigations with charged particles), a very good agreement was observed between results of the model and the experimental data with an average relative deviation of 3% and 4% for LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors respectively."}{"Construction and characterization of materials equivalent to the tissues and organs of the human body for radiotherapy ": "Treatment planning systems (TPS) give analytical results with very high dose gradients. For this reason, it is necessary to have solid equivalent materials that replace the different tissues and organs of the human body for different applications in Medical Physics. The objective of this work was to manufacture equivalent or alternative materials of some human body tissues such as: soft tissue (SOT), adipose tissue (ADT), lung tissue (LUT), bone tissue (BOT), muscle tissue (MUT), brain tissue (BAT), breast tissue (BET) and, organs such as: liver (LI), kidney (KI), bladder (BL), characterize them, determining their densities, mass attenuation coefficient (TMAC) and effective atomic number (Zeff). TMAC values were obtained from PENELOPE version 2014 code and, to determine the Zeff values, the Auto-Zeff version 1.7 software was used. The equivalent materials were prepared based on epoxy resin, mixed with phenolic microspheres, calcium carbonate and pulverized bull bone, obtaining non-malleable, non-degradable and non-toxic solid samples, which were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Density values ranging from 0.29\u202fg/cm3 for lung and, to 1.80\u202fg/cm3 for bone, were obtained in the characterization of these equivalent materials. Electron microscopy analysis does not detect the hydrogen percentage by weight in all the samples. For this reason, for TMAC validation, these percentage values were taken from the ICRU-44 report and other scientific database to be compared with the materials manufactured and analyzed by SEM. Under these conditions it was shown that the manufactured materials are equivalent to the ICRU report and other publications. The results indicate a maximum Average Percentage Difference (APD) of 1.64% for BL and, a minimum APD of 0.29% for BOT with respect to the TMAC ICRU values. For Zeff results, a good agreement was found for BOT and LUT with respect to other related works for energies from 0.1\u202fMeV to 20\u202fMeV."}{"xTunes: A new XAS processing tool for detailed and on-the-fly analysis ": "A new X-ray absorption spectrum processing tool, xTunes, with a friendly graphical user interface was developed to handle large XAS data sets. It is written in Fortran and Visual Basic. xTunes can import XAS data and perform basic XAS processing, such as background subtraction, normalization, extraction of EXAFS oscillation, Fourier transform, etc. The main feature of xTunes is live data plotting of XAS data stored in a target directory, in real-time, with pre-processed XAS data parameters, to efficiently handle time-resolved data from quick XAFS measurement.

To mitigate these drawbacks or to produce new sustainable products, chemical modification of cellulose becomes necessary in most cases. Introduction of synthetic polymers with specific properties onto cellulose via radiation-induced grafting is one of the key approaches to modify its physical and chemical properties. Utilizing reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods in radiation induced grafting may provide unique opportunities to tailor the surface properties of cellulose by controlling the graft length and architecture. Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) is of prime importance as it constitutes a bridge between nanoscience and natural cellulosic resources. The modification of this nanomaterial via radiation-induced grafting approach represents a striking potential to be explored by academy and industry. In this article it is intended to highlight the recent works on the modification of cellulose and nanocellulose via radiation-induced graft copolymerization by conventional and RDRP methods."}{"Radiation shielding properties of polyimide composite materials ": "This work presents data on the possibility and perspectives of using bismuth silicate as a filler for a radiation\u2013shielding composite based on the polyimide matrix. The aim of this work was to experimentally estimate the protective characteristics of this polymer composite during the passage of electron energy (from 1 to 6\u202fMeV) and gamma ray energy (0.4\u202fMeV and 0.662\u202fMeV). For a larger range of energy, theoretical calculations for the passage of electrons and gamma radiation through the composite were used. The introduction of the proposed filler in an amount of 70\u202fwt% reduced the effective range of the electron by two times in the polyimide. The absorption coefficient of electrons in the proposed composite was much greater than the coefficient of reflection for electrons of the same energy. As the initial energy of the electron increases, the effect of their reflection decreases and the effect of their absorption increases. According to experimental data, the linear attenuation coefficients at 0.5\u202fMeV and 0.662\u202fMeV of energy were 0.87\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fcm\u20131 and 0.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202fcm\u20131, respectively. At an energy of 0.5\u202fMeV, the linear attenuation coefficient for the composite was 2.5 times and 1.4 times more than that of aluminum at an energy of 0.5\u202fMeV and 1\u202fMeV, respectively. The difference between the estimated and experimental data was small (around 8\u201311%), such that the calculated and the experimental results were in agreement."}{"Development of in situ cell for simultaneous XAFS/XRD measurements at high temperatures ": "A novel in situ cell was developed for simultaneous X-ray absorption fine structure and X-ray diffraction (XAFS/XRD) measurements at high temperatures up to 1773\u202fK in a gas atmosphere such as air containing reactive oxygen, in which typical heat-resistant or environmental-barrier materials are used. This new cell can provide multimodal information by combining the following complementary information: (a) chemical states of a specific element and the short-range order (SRO) structure around the atoms, via XAFS measurements, and (b) the long-range order (LRO) crystal structure, via XRD. In situ observation of XAFS/XRD is essential to characterize materials under severe conditions, because reactions sometimes accompany metastable states, and quenching high-temperature states down to room temperature is quite difficult.\n                  The performance of the new cell was checked by in situ XAFS/XRD observation of the phase transition of TiO2 from anatase to rutile. Then, the developed technique was applied to a new type of environmental-barrier coating material, Yb2Si2O7, which was exposed to heat cycles up to 1773\u202fK in air. The bulk structure maintained the chemical state of Yb3+ and the crystal structure of Yb2Si2O7, and no reaction phase was observed. The developed technique could provide fundamental information to understand the behaviors of materials used at high temperatures."}{"Near-infrared small molecular fluorescent dyes for photothermal therapy ": "Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes based on small organic molecules are characterized with low cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility and minimum interference from auto-fluorescence background, which are widely used in tumor diagnosis.

Due to the long decay time of persistent luminescence, the background autofluorescence in complex sample and tissues can be effectively eliminated, thus significantly improving the sensitivity of bioanalysis. Besides, such a long decay time of luminescence also makes PLNPs valuable for long-term bioimaging. Benefiting from these merits, PLNPs have been widely used for biomedical applications, especially biosensing and bioimaging. In this review, we conclude the progress in the application of PLNPs at biosensing and bioimaging in recent years, and also provide our understanding of the prospects."}{"Recent advances in asymmetric synthesis of 2-substituted indoline derivatives ": "ABSTRACT\n               \n                  Enantiomerically pure 2-substituted indolines are an important class of nitrogen heterocycles that occur frequently in many alkaloid natural products and biologically active compounds.

Through reviewing the related aspects, readers can have a deeper understanding of the application prospects of plasma in electrocatalysis."}{"Recent applications of radical cascade reaction in the synthesis of functionalized 1-indenones ": "1-Indenones are important scaffolds in natural products, biologically active molecules as well as functional materials. Recently, radical cascade cyclization has emerged as an efficient and powerful strategy for the construction of valuable and versatile functionalized 1-indenones. In this review, the recent advances of this rapidly growing area were summarized. The selected examples have been classified according to the type of reaction substrates such as 1,3-diarylpropynones, 2-alkynylbenzonitriles, arylpropynols, 1,5-enynes and 2-alkynylated bromocinnamates."}{"Supramolecular polymers fabricated by orthogonal self-assembly based on multiple hydrogen bonding and macrocyclic host\u2013guest interactions ": "Supramolecular polymers constructed by orthogonal self\u2013assembly based on multiple hydrogen bonding and macrocyclic host\u2013guest interactions have received increasing attention due to their elegant structures, outstanding properties, and potential applications. Hydrogen bonding endows these supramolecular polymers with good adaptability and reversibility, while macrocyclic host\u2013guest interactions give them good selectivity and versatile stimuli-responsiveness. Therefore, functional supramolecular polymers fabricated by these two highly specific, noninterfering interactions in an orthogonal way have shown wide applications in the fields of molecular machines, electronics, soft materials, etc. In this review, we discuss the recent advances of functional supramolecular polymers fabricated by orthogonal self-assembly based on multiple hydrogen bonding and host\u2013guest interactions. In particular, we focus on crown ether- and pillar[n]arene-based supramolecular polymers due to their compatibility with multiple hydrogen bonds in organic solution. The fabrication strategies, interesting properties, and potential applications of these advanced supramolecular materials are mainly concerned."}{"Solid-state nanopores for ion and small molecule analysis ": "Solid-state nanopore in analytical chemistry has developed rapidly in the 1990s and it is proved to be a versatile new tool for bioanalytical chemistry. The research field of solid-state nanopore starts from mimicking the biological nanopore in living cells. Understanding the transport mechanism of biological nanopore in vivo is a big challenge because of the experimental difficulty, so it is essential to establish the basic research of artificial nanopores in vitro especially for the analysis of ions and small molecules. The performance of solid-state nanopores could be evaluated by monitoring currents when ions and molecules passed through. The comparison of the two types of nanopores based on current-derived information can reveal the principle of biological nanopores, while the solid-state nanopores are applied into practical bioanalysis. In this review, we focus on the researches of the solid-state nanopores in the fabrication process and in the analysis of ions and small molecules. Fabrication methods of nanopores, ion transport mechanism, small molecule analysis and theoretical studies are discussed in detail."}{"Gold nanoparticles as dehydrogenase mimicking nanozymes for estradiol degradation ": "Nanozyme catalysis has been mainly focused on a few chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates, while environmentally and biologically important compounds need to be tested to advance the field. In this work, we studied oxidation of estradiol (E2) in the presence of various nanomaterials including gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), nanoceria (CeO2), Fe3O4, Fe2O3, MnO2 and Mn2O3, and found that AuNPs had a dehydrogenase-mimicking activity to convert E2 to estrone (E1). This conversion was monitored using HPLC. The reaction was faster at higher pH and reached saturation at pH 8. Smaller AuNPs had a higher catalytic efficiency and 5\u2009nm AuNPs were 4.8-fold faster than 13\u2009nm at the same total surface area. Finally, we tried 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2) as a substrate and found that 5\u2009nm AuNPs can catalyze EE2 oxidation in the presence of H2O2. This work indicated that some nanomaterials can affect environmentally important hormones via oxidation reactions, and this study has expanded the scope of substrate of nanozymes."}{"Rhodium(III)-catalyzed intermolecular cyclization of anilines with sulfoxonium ylides toward indoles ": "Rhodium(III)-catalyzed synthesis of indole derivatives has been realized via cascade reaction of CH alkylation/nucleophilic cyclization starting from readily available N-phenylpyridin-2-amines and sulfoxonium ylides. Notably, this transformation could smoothly proceed with high yields, good regioselectivity, and feature broad group tolerance and under redox-neutral condition to avoid external oxidant. The titled products are potentially important building blocks in the organic synthesis through various chemical transformations."}{"Hydrothermal synthesis of MoS2 with controllable morphologies and its adsorption properties for bisphenol A ": "The effect of preparation conditions (molar ratio of S/Mo, hydrothermal temperature and time) on the morphologies of MoS2 was investigated. The as-synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectra and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller\u2019s (BET) surface area measurement. Results showed that the three kinds of morphologies of MoS2 were obtained. Morphologies varied gradually from the coral-like aggregated particles to flower-like spheres to wrapped nano-sheet structure with increasing hydrothermal temperature and time. It is meaningful for specific morphology demand in different fields. Moreover, the prepared materials were used as tentative adsorbents for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA) as a representative of endocrine disruptors. The results showed that the prepared MoS2 materials with wrapped nano-sheet structure had good adsorption capacity (39.03\u202fmg/g) and fast adsorption rate (0.0053\u202fg/(mg/min). The adsorption process was thermodynamically exothermic and spontaneous. The study indicated that electrostatic interaction is strong and \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between BPA and the MoS2 materials play an important role for BPA adsorption."}{"Reprint of: Motivational active learning: An integrated approach to teaching and learning process control ": "Process Control is a course that needs a thorough understanding of how the different unit operations work and what are the implications of changing operation variables in a process. This paper presents how education innovation can help students to improve their learning and understanding of the different concepts and thus to get better results in the subject and to achieve the desired outcomes. The Process Control Course is taught in the Bachelor Degree in Chemical Engineering at the Technical University of Madrid. Different methodologies have been integrated and used in the course as: flipped classroom, peer instruction or gamification. In order to implement the mentioned methods, the following material has been developed: screencasts, concept tests, trivia contest and simulations besides the traditional lecturing material (slides and text). First year results show high student motivation, higher participation in class and better results (marks) in the subject."}{"Assessing the performance of UK universities in the field of chemical engineering using data envelopment analysis ": "University rankings have become an important tool to compare academic institutions within and across countries. Yet, they rely on aggregated scores based on subjective weights which render them sensitive to experts\u2019 preferences and not fully transparent to final users. To overcome this limitation, we apply Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate UK universities in the field of chemical engineering as a case study, using data retrieved from two national rankings. DEA is a non-parametric approach developed for the multi-criteria assessment of entities that avoids the use of subjective weightings and aggregated scores; this is accomplished by calculating an efficiency index, on the basis of which universities can be classified as either \u2018efficient\u2019 or \u2018inefficient\u2019. Our analysis shows that the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) occupying the highest positions in the chemical engineering rankings might not be the most efficient ones, and vice versa, which highlights the need to complement the use of rankings with other analytical tools. Overall, DEA provides further insight into the assessment of HEIs, allowing institutions to better understand their weaknesses and strengths, while pinpointing sources of inefficiencies where improvement efforts must be directed."}{"Applying PBL methodologies to the chemical engineering courses: Unit operations and modeling and simulation, using a joint course project ": "Unit Operations and Modelling and Simulation have been for long time a staple of the academic formation of any chemical engineer. Both are integral to the analysis of any chemical process, discretizing it into smaller specific processes that can then be characterized and modelled through the solution of balance, thermodynamics and transport equations. However, students usually perceive these subjects as separate fields of knowledge, and they do not develop the ability to correlate and integrate them to solve real-world problems in their future profession. On account of this, a Project-Based Learning (PBL) methodology was proposed in the redesign of the abovementioned undergraduate courses, focusing initially in Unit Operations. This PBL method was implemented alongside a joint course project, consisting on the design, assembly and characterization of a centrifugal pump, to be analyzed experimentally and computationally. To assess the success of this methodology, a survey was conducted on the students after they finished their courses. The results were mostly positive (85%), as the students appreciated the design component of the project, considering that it benefits their learning process, as well as the challenge it presented. This difficulty forced them to resort to different sources of information and areas of knowledge, alien to those provided in the courses. The limitations of the chosen project revolved around its limited scope and lack of connection with other topics of the courses (i.e. distillation columns). These limitations will be addressed with the design of transversal projects, which can cover more of the subjects seen in both classes."}{"Developing a framework for assessing teaching effectiveness in higher education ": "Evaluating the effectiveness of teaching and learning core knowledge outcomes and professional skills is a highly challenging task that has not yet been satisfactorily addressed at higher education level. The iTeach European project consortium developed a framework for assessing the effectiveness of various pedagogical methodologies in chemical engineering education, including those aiming to promote important core competencies related to employability, in a range of geographical and educational contexts.\n                  The framework was firstly implemented in a core chemical engineering area (reaction engineering) to check its usability and robustness, and subsequently was also tested on a range of subject areas from various branches of engineering and other disciplines, one of which is analysed in more detail in this contribution. The results of this broader assessment encompassed a much more diverse student body with varying educational experiences and a wider range of different teaching methodologies. The outcomes of this assessment are highlighted and the benefits of such an objective approach for evaluating teaching effectiveness is discussed."}{"Reprint of: Education of chemical engineering in Spain: A global picture ": "The general framework of the Chemical Engineering studies in Spain includes the Bachelor's Degree (4 years), Master's Degree (the most common duration is 1.5 years) and Doctorate (3-4 years). In 2008, the Conference of Directors and Deans of Chemical Engineering (CODDIQ) was constituted with the main objective of promoting and improving the quality of Chemical Engineering studies in Spain. Currently, Faculties and Schools of 29 Spanish universities are members of CODDIQ. An analysis of the most characteristic indicators provides a representative radiography of the Chemical Engineering Studies in Spain, whose most outstanding data are: (i) 7,396 undergraduate students, 1,014 Master students and 556 PhD students, (ii) according to the gender profile of undergraduates and graduates, the percentage of women is similar to that of men, while for faculty staff, the percentage of women is 43% and 46% for Associate and Assistant Professor (respectively) and 23% for the category of Full Professor category; (iii) after completing the Bachelor studies, most of them continue their training in the MSc in Chemical Engineering, (iv) the employability after obtaining the Master's degree is very high (>75%), which in the case of PhDs is close to 100%. The studies of Chemical Engineering in Spain have a very direct relationship with society, especially in the chemical, environmental, biotechnological and energy fields. The companies that collaborate in the training of future professionals are distributed throughout the national territory, which allows a strong connection with the socioeconomic environment."}{"New chemical engineering provision: Quality in diversity ": "Recent growth in chemical engineering student numbers has driven an increase in the number of UK universities offering the subject. The implications of this growth are described, along with the different challenges facing new providers in the UK compared with established departments. The approaches taken by the various new entrants are reviewed, with reference to recruitment strategies, infrastructure, the use of external facilities, and the particular flavours of chemical engineering being offered by the new providers. Information about the differentiating features of the large number of chemical engineering degree courses now available is somewhat indistinct: this should be rectified in the interests both of prospective students and of employers. Dilemmas facing new providers include the need to address the fundamentals of the subject as well as moving into more novel research-led areas; enabling students to develop the competencies to sustain them for a whole career as well as meeting immediate employer needs; and providing sufficient industry understanding when academics may lack substantial industrial experience. The central importance of practical provision and of the design project, and the approaches taken by new providers to deliver these components, are reviewed, together with the role of software tools in chemical engineering education, and measures to facilitate industry input into courses. As long as it is not used prescriptively or to inhibit innovation, the accreditation process provides constructive guidance and leverage for universities developing new chemical engineering programmes."}{"A framework for hands-on learning in chemical engineering education\u2014Training students with the end goal in mind ": "Chemical engineering education aims to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and hands-on capability to solve practical problems. At Imperial College London, this is practiced via three laboratory-based courses, which span over the first three years of the undergraduate curriculum. The Foundation, Knowledge and Discovery Laboratories were designed based on Kolb\u2019s experiential learning theory as well as Vygotsky\u2019s zone of proximal development. Although these courses intend to challenge students, appropriate scaffolding is in place to ensure a satisfactory learning experience across the spectrum of abilities. Assessment and survey results show that all students were capable of meeting the learning goals (>96% achieving satisfactory to excellent results in academic years 2014\u20132016), while a large majority is satisfied with the courses (>80% in academic years 2014\u20132016). The design and implementation of these courses are discussed to promote the exchange of good practices within the higher education community."}{"Learning distillation by a combined experimental and simulation approach in a three steps laboratory: Vapor pressure, vapor-liquid equilibria and distillation column ": "Distillation is one of the most important separation process in industrial chemistry. This operation is based on a deep knowledge of the fluid phase equilibria involved in the mixture to be separated. In particular, the most important aspects are the determination of the vapor pressures of the single compounds and the correct representation of the eventual not ideality of the mixture. Simulation science is a fundamental tool for managing these complex topics and chemical engineers students have to learn and to use it on real case-studies. To give to the students a complete overview of these complex aspects, a laboratory experience is proposed. Three different work stations were set up: i) determination of vapor pressure of two pure compounds; ii) the study of vapor-liquid equilibria of a binary mixture; iii) the use of a continuous multistage distillation column in dynamic and steady-state conditions. The simulation of all these activities by a commercial software, PRO II by AVEVA, allows to propose and verify the thermodynamic characteristics of the mixture and to correctly interpret the distillation column data. Moreover, the experimental plants and the data elaboration by classical equations are presented. The students are request to prepare a final report in which the description of the experimental plants and experimental procedure, the interpretation of the results and the simulation study are critically discussed in order to encourage them to reason and to acquire the concepts of the course.\n                  Two different questionnaires each with 7 questions, for the course and for the laboratory, are proposed and analyzed. The final evaluation of the students was strongly positive both for the course as a whole and for the proposed laboratory activities."}{"(INVITED) Vortex solitons: Old results and new perspectives ": "A comparative review is given of some well-known and some recent results obtained in studies of two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons, with emphasis on states carrying embedded vorticity. Physical realizations of multidimensional solitons in atomic Bose\u2013Einstein condensates (BECs) and nonlinear optics are briefly discussed too. Unlike 1D solitons, which are typically stable, 2D and 3D ones are vulnerable to instabilities induced by the occurrence of the critical and supercritical collapse, respectively, in the 2D and 3D models with the cubic self-focusing nonlinearity. Vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting instability. For this reason, a central problem is looking for physical settings in which 2D and 3D solitons may be stabilized. The review addresses in detail two well-established topics, viz., the stabilization of vortex solitons by means of competing nonlinearities, or by trapping potentials (harmonic-oscillator and spatially-periodic ones). The former topic includes a new addition, closely related to the recent breakthrough, viz., the prediction and creation of robust quantum droplets. Two other topics included in the review outline new schemes which were recently elaborated for the creation of stable vortical solitons in BEC. One scheme relies on the use of the spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) in binary condensates with cubic intrinsic attraction, making it possible to predict stable 2D and 3D solitons, which couple or mix components with vorticities \n                        \n                           S\n                           =\n                           0\n                        \n                      and \n                        \n                           \u00b1\n                           1\n                        \n                      (semi-vortices (SVs) or mixed modes (MMs), respectively). In this system, the situation is drastically different in the 2D and 3D geometries. In 2D, the SOC helps to create a ground state (GS, which does not exist otherwise), represented by stable SV or MM solitons, whose norm falls below the threshold value at which the critical collapse sets in. In the 3D geometry, the supercritical collapse does not allow one to create a GS, but metastable solitons of the SV and MM types can be constructed. Another new scheme makes it possible to create stable 2D\u00a0vortex-ring solitons with arbitrarily high \n                        S\n                      in a binary BEC with components coupled by microwave radiation. Some other topics are addressed briefly, such as vortex solitons in dissipative media, and attempts to create vortex solitons in experiments."}{"Dynamics of coupled generators of quasiperiodic oscillations: Different types of synchronization and other phenomena ": "A problem of synchronization of quasiperiodic oscillations is discussed in application to an example of coupled systems with autonomous quasiperiodic dynamics. Charts of Lyapunov exponents are presented that reveal characteristic domains on the parameter plane such as oscillator death, complete synchronization, phase synchronization of quasiperiodic oscillations, broadband synchronization, broadband quasiperiodicity. Features of each kind of dynamical behavior are discussed. Analysis of corresponding bifurcations is presented, including quasiperiodic Hopf bifurcations, saddle\u2013node bifurcations of invariant tori of different dimensions, and bifurcations of torus doublings. Both the case of dominance of quasiperiodic oscillations in one of the generators and the case of pronounced periodic resonances embedded in the region of quasiperiodicity are considered."}{"A dual construction of the isotropic Landau\u2013Lifshitz model ": "By interchanging the roles of the space and time coordinates, we describe a dual construction of the isotropic Landau\u2013Lifshitz model, providing equal-space Poisson brackets and dual Hamiltonians conserved with respect to space-evolution. This construction is built in the Lax/zero-curvature formalism, where the duality between the space and time dependencies is evident."}{"An information-theoretic study of fish swimming in the wake of a pitching airfoil ": "Swimming in schools affords several advantages for fish, including enhanced ability to escape from predators, searching for food, and finding correct migratory routes. However, the role of hydrodynamics in coordinated swimming is still not fully understood due to a lack of data-driven approaches to disentangle causes from effects. In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms underlying fish schooling, we propose an empirical study that integrates information theory and experimental biology. We studied the interactions between an actively pitching airfoil and a fish swimming in a flow. The pitching frequency of the airfoil was varied randomly over time, eliciting an information-rich interaction between the airfoil and the fish. Within an information-theoretic framework, we examined the information content of fish tail beating and information transfer from the airfoil to the fish. The proposed framework may help improve our understanding of the role of hydrodynamics in fish swimming, thereby supporting hypothesis-driven studies on the hydrodynamic advantages of fish schooling."}{"Hamiltonian systems with L\u00e9vy noise: Symplecticity, Hamilton\u2019s principle and averaging principle ": "This work focuses on topics related to Hamiltonian stochastic differential equations with L\u00e9vy noise. We first show that the phase flow of the stochastic system preserves symplectic structure, and propose a stochastic version of Hamilton\u2019s principle by the corresponding formulation of the stochastic action integral and the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation. Based on these properties, we further investigate the effective behavior of a small transversal perturbation to a completely integrable stochastic Hamiltonian system with L\u00e9vy noise. We establish an averaging principle in the sense that the action component of solution converges to the solution of a stochastic differential equation when the scale parameter goes to zero. Furthermore, we obtain the estimation for the rate of this convergence. Finally, we present an example to illustrate these results."}{"Stability analysis of predator\u2013prey models involving cross-diffusion ": "In this paper we have considered a three dimensional system of partial differential equations to model the dynamical interactions of two predators competing for a single prey. The model is developed by introducing cross diffusion in such a way as to take into account the migratory strategy adopted by the predators, who take advantage of the defense switching behavior of the prey. Equilibria of the model are determined and a local stability analysis is discussed. The main result presented here is that for certain range of values of the cross diffusion parameters, the system has a continuum of equilibria and a zip-type bifurcation occurs and this is not sustainable due to the emergence of Turing type instability."}{"Nested mixed-mode oscillations ": "This paper discusses nested mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) generated by a nonautonomousBonhoeffer\u2013van der Pol oscillator with a diode. We use our previously-proposed constrained piecewise-smooth dynamics, where the diode is assumed to operate as a switch (Kousaka et\u00a0al., 2017). This idealized model corresponds to a degenerate case in which one of the parameters tends to infinity and the circuit dynamics are represented by a one-variable piecewise nonautonomous equation, enabling one-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 return maps to be rigorously defined. We use these maps to investigate the bifurcation structures between the \n                        \n                           \n                              1\n                           \n                           \n                              4\n                           \n                        \n                     - and \n                        \n                           \n                              1\n                           \n                           \n                              5\n                           \n                        \n                     -generating regions.

We also observe doubly nested MMOIB structures, although we find significant differences between singly and doubly nested MMOIBs. Whereas clear sequences of singly nested MMOIB-generated MMOs appear in the one-parameter bifurcation diagram, the MMO-generating regions in the doubly nested case are extremely narrow in comparison (although we do confirm that they also occur successively). The generation of singly and doubly nested MMOIB sequences can be explained by the one-dimensional maps at the MMO increment-terminating tangent bifurcation points toward which the MMOIBs accumulate."}{"An overview of biodiesel production using recyclable biomass and non-biomass derived magnetic catalysts ": "Biodiesel has emerged as a promising alternative to energy sources due to its eco-friendly and renewable nature. However, the issue associated with traditional biodiesel production is the expensive production cost on the industrial scale, mainly contributed by the raw materials. Therefore, catalyst plays an important role with the purpose to speed up the overall biodiesel production rate and minimizing the production cost. Over the course, numerous researches have been done on various types of catalyst in biodiesel production. Henceforth, this review comprises of a comprehensive overview of biodiesel production by discussing the latest trends, that utilizes biomass waste-derived biochar catalyst. Apart from that, the focus of this review will be on magnetic catalyst (derived from both biomass and non-biomass) used in biodiesel synthesis whereby the magnetic catalyst synthesis method and characterisation, as well as compilation of experimental data of different literatures on using magnetic catalyst will be included in the framework of this paper. Moreover, the magnetic catalyst reusability studies are also highlighted in this review. Application of biomass-based magnetic catalyst in biodiesel production may be one of the solutions to overcome the catalyst separation issue and to further the development of economically feasible biodiesel industry and ultimately, transforming the current energy options into a greener and more sustainable sources of energy."}{"Photocatalytic activity improvement and application of UV-TiO2 photocatalysis in textile wastewater treatment: A review ": "Treatment of textile wastewater using titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis has been started from the last decade and reached attention to the researchers because of its versatile application. The variety of applications of TiO2 as a photocatalyst has been taken place because of low operating temperature, biologically inert nature, low energy consumption, water insolubility, ease availability and photoactivity, less toxicity, high chemical stability, suitable flat band potential, narrow band gap and environmentally benign. The successful and efficient application of photocatalysis depends on quality of photocatalyst, nature of pollutants, and source of light, which should be in close contact with each other. The TiO2 photocatalyst is used for the effluent treatment of textile wastewater in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Heterogeneous UV-TiO2 photocatalysis is capable to remove organic pollutants from textile wastewater, which has been widely studied and the technology also being commercialized in many developing countries in the world. This review focuses on the mechanism of UV-TiO2 photocatalysis, modification of TiO2 photocatalyst, and application of doping and co-doping in order to improve the photocatalytic activity in wastewater treatment. In addition, the review conveys comprehensive and fundamental assessments of the photocatalytic activity for the removal of organic dyes and phenolic compounds from textile wastewater."}{"Photoelectrocatalytic fuel cells and photoelectrode microbial fuel cells for wastewater treatment and power generation ": "The use of solar energy for wastewater treatment combined with energy production by means of photoelectrocatalytic and photoelectrode microbial fuel cells has been reviewed, presenting the basic principles, the design and strengths and weaknesses of the devices. The most important parameters to evaluate the performance of this type of fuel cells are the pollutant degradation efficiency and the maximum power density generated. The effect of external and internal fuel cell parameters on the pollutant degradation efficiency and the maximum power density has been extensively discussed."}{"Potential and challenges of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in dye wastewater treatment: A review ": "Enzymes are known to catalyze reactions at high efficiency, operate at milder conditions and are biodegradable. Due to enzyme limitations such as sensitivity to environmental conditions, enzyme immobilization is often used. The commonly employed immobilization methods include adsorption, entrapment, covalent attachment and cross-linking. Many research works have now focused on the immobilization of enzymes on nanoscale support due to the higher surface area to volume ratio, effective enzyme loading, significantly enhanced mass transfer efficiency and minimization of diffusional problems. The application of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in the treatment of dye wastewater is thus, of high interest. Therefore, this paper has critically reviewed (1) the current technologies available for dye wastewater treatment; (2) different methods utilized for enzyme immobilization; and (3) the application and performance of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology for dye wastewater treatment. We identified that there is high potential for enzyme incorporated nanotechnology to be implemented in dye wastewater treatment due to the high decolorization performance (e.g. laccase immobilized on Fe3O4/SiO2 nanoparticles achieved 99% decolorization of Procion Red MX-5B in 20\u202fmin). We have also identified the key challenges faced by enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in dye wastewater treatment that includes: (i) realization of lab scale experiments to industrial applications; (ii) lack of understanding of enzymes incorporated nanotechnology; (iii) recovery of immobilized enzyme; (iv) synthesis of hybrid nanoflowers; and (v) sustainability of the nanomaterials used."}{"Degradation of amoxicillin by Fenton and Fenton-integrated hybrid oxidation processes ": "The present study aims to investigate the degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) using the Fenton process and hybrid Fenton-like processes such as photo-Fenton, solar photo-Fenton, sono-Fenton, and sono-photo-Fenton. The effect of ferrous ions (Fe2+), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and pH was evaluated. Complete degradation was achieved within 12\u2009min of reaction time under the optimized conditions of Fe2+- 30\u2009mg/l, H2O2 \u2013 375\u2009mg/l, and pH\u2009\u2013\u20093.0 during Fenton\u2019s process. Efficiency towards degradation of AMX was enhanced when the Fenton\u2019s process was coupled with UV- light illumination, solar light illumination, and UV light-Ultrasound treatment. Complete degradation was observed within 3.5\u2009min and 9\u2009min during the photo-Fenton and solar photo-Fenton process, respectively. The sono-Fenton process takes a longer time to degrade AMX than other processes while sono-photo-Fenton process degrades AMX within 6\u2009min. The reason for a reduced rate of degradation of AMX in the sono-Fenton process may be attributed to the competition of ultrasound and Fenton for H2O2, which ultimately decreases Fenton reagent in the process. The study concluded that the Fenton process coupled with other UV/solar light is more efficient than the stand-alone Fenton process towards degradation of AMX."}{"\n               Shorea robusta derived activated carbon decorated with manganese dioxide hybrid composite for improved capacitive behaviors ": "Shorea robusta derived activated carbon decorated with MnO2 was successfully prepared. Thus prepared activated carbon was characterized by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)/Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Results revealed that prepared material was found to be amorphous having oxygenated surface functional groups with the specific surface area 1270\u202fm2\u202fg\u22121 (\u00b10.57%). Electrochemical characterization was also performed by three-electrode system where carbon electrode was used as working electrode, platinum plate was used as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode was used as a reference electrode. The experiments were performed in 6\u202fM aqueous KOH using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge\u2013Discharge (GCD) and Impendance Spectroscopy (EIS). The specific capacitance acquired from GCD at 1\u202fAg\u22121 was found to be 136.3\u202fFg\u22121 (\u00b10.15%) with 0.44\u202f\u03a9 (\u00b10.02%) ESR. The 97% capacitance retention was observed after 1000 cycles. The energy density of carbon electrode was found to be 3.0 (\u00b10.25%)\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg\u22121 at 100.5 (\u00b10.20%)\u202fW\u202fkg\u22121 power density. The working carbon electrode was replaced by \u201chybrid composite electrode\u201d which showed the ideal capacitive behaviors having 480.4 (\u00b10.20%)\u202fF\u202fg\u22121 capacitance, 24 (\u00b10.26%)\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg\u22121 specific energy density and low ESR value of 0.41 (\u00b10.02%)\u202f\u03a9. The results showed that the desirable electrochemical capacitive performances enable the hybrid composite to act as a new bio material for high-performance supercapacitors and energy storage devices."}{"Electrochemical degradation of triclosan in aqueous solution. A study of the performance of an electro-Fenton reactor ": "The electro-Fenton degradation of Triclosan in aqueous solution was studied using a cylindrical reactor in which polarized carbon cloth electrodes and a cation exchange resin were employed. Using a factorial design of experiments approach, the effect of four variables (considering two levels for each one), was measured on four response parameters that reflect the electrooxidation efficiency of the electrochemical reactor. The results revealed that in all cases triclosan degradation was very efficient (above 95%) and that while there is a reasonable effect of all variables and their interactions, the one with the strongest influence on the process is the nature and magnitude of the ionic strength of the electrolytic solution. In this way, while the presence of a buffer species in this solution can keep the pH in a value that affects the generation of \u2022OH radicals from the Fenton mixture, a high ionic strength solution can promote the elimination of Fe ionic species from the reactor by decreasing resin Fe retention due to competition effects of other ions for the binding sites of the substrate. HPLC experiments of the effluent solutions, also revealed that the degradation by-products of triclosan were dependent on the nature and ionic strength of the electrolytic solution in the electro-Fenton process under study. Finally, comparison of the different operation modes, also suggested that electro-adsorption of Fe cationic species in the negatively polarized cathode surface, is the main factor that controls Fe ion retention within the reactor."}{"Flocculation: An effective way to harvest microalgae for biodiesel production ": "Microalgae are considered the most suitable feedstock for biodiesel production due to their higher areal productivity and lipid content. The economical production of biofuels from microalgae is important. This paper is a review of different techniques used for flocculating microalgae such as use of inorganic salts, organic salts, bioflocculants, autoflocculation and electrolytic flocculation for harvesting microalgae for biodiesel production. It was found that the usage of natural flocculants for harvesting microalgae eliminates the toxicity of biomass harvested but the cost of flocculant makes it uneconomical for large scale applications. The economic method of harvesting large quantity of microalgae still requires further research and development."}{"Realistic interplays between data science and chemical engineering in the first quarter of the 21st century: Facts and a vision ": "Data science, digit(al)ization, Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing: all these terms are receiving heavy interest from industry and funding institutions. While some definitions remain hazy, the financial success of the digital giants has led to a bandwagon all too many companies are happy to jump on. Successes are also reported in the chemical and engineering sciences, driven by specific enablers as well as technical specificities of the application areas. High expectations for data science applications in chemical engineering have resulted, together with a loss of visibility of the limits of a purely data-centric approach. At the same time, chemical engineers may not be fully prepared to embrace the digital revolution in general, and data science in particular. This Short communication, aimed at all stakeholders of the digital transformation of the chemical industry, sets out an aspirational vision for the data science\u2013chemical engineering interplay, together with needs, opportunities, and suggested approaches to address them. Several frameworks are also given to inform technical strategies: activity classes; workflows; and a decision tree to consciously assess what approaches to privilege."}{"Perspective of renewable desalination by using membrane distillation ": "As the water demand increases continuously, large capacities of desalination plant are added every year to meet freshwater demand. The higher carbon footprint of desalination raises concern on global climate change. The integration of desalination and renewable energy source could mitigate this water-energy nexus. Membrane distillation (MD) is a non-isothermal desalination process in which the low-grade heat is used as the driving force. Many researchers have tried to integrate solar energy and MD for sustainable water desalination. This article presents a comprehensive review of solar MD desalination to understand its current state of development. Solar powered MD systems have been investigated for last few decades. However, its commercialization is very limited due to low flux, high specific energy consumption and large collector area requirement. Further, this review presents the recent developments in MD membrane, innovative MD modules and the importance of optimization, which was able to improve the performance of solar MD."}{"Mathematical modeling and process parametric study of CO2 removal from natural gas by hollow fiber membranes ": "Hollow fiber membranes show a great potential in natural gas sweetening by removing CO2 to meet gas grid specifications. A membrane model with high prediction accuracy is developed to model multicomponent gas transport through hollow fiber modules. The influences of hollow fiber diameter and length, and packing density on module efficiency related to pressure drops in both sides were systematically investigated based on the developed model. The total pressure drop along the length is less than 1% if the inner diameter of hollow fibers (0.6m length) is larger than 200\u03bcm. Moreover, the highest module packing density was found to be dependent on hollow fiber dimension, and too high packing density will cause extreme high pressure drops. Both feed CO2 concentration and pressure were found to significantly influence membrane module performance related to the required specific membrane area and hydrocarbon loss based on process parametric study of CO2 removal from natural gas. Larger pressure drops along fiber length was found for the more-permeable polyimide membranes compared to the less-permeable cellulose acetate and carbon membranes. The developed model can be used for guiding the design of efficient hollow fiber membrane modules and potentially process simulation of membrane gas separation."}{"Techno-economic comparison of reverse water gas shift reaction to steam and dry methane reforming reactions for syngas production ": "This work evaluates the economics of syngas production processes by the reverse water gas shift (rWGS) reaction against the dry methane reforming (DMR) reaction and its combination with the steam methane reforming reaction (SMR-DMR). The DMR and SMR-DMR processes show lower total annual costs comparing to the rWGS process for the production of syngas with H2/CO ratio of 1 and 2, respectively. Breakeven analysis has been performed on the price of H2, natural gas, and CO2 tax rate. At a H2 price of $1/kg, the rWGS process is comparable to the DMR process when natural gas price and CO2 tax rate are $0.53/m3 (STP) and $44/1000\u2009kg, respectively. For the rWGS process to be as economical as the SMR-DMR process, natural gas prices in the range of $0.35\u20130.53/m3 (STP) and CO2 tax rates up to $60/1000\u2009kg are needed while keeping the H2 price below $2/kg."}{"Process intensification in multicomponent distillation: A review of recent advancements ": "Process intensification (PI) is an emerging concept in chemical engineering that describes the design innovations that lead to significant shrinkage in size and boost in efficiency of a process plant. Distillation, the most commonly used separation technique in the chemical industry, is a crucial component of PI. Here, we systematically discuss the following aspects of PI in non-azeotropic multicomponent distillation: (1) Introducing thermal couplings to eliminate intermediate reboilers and condensers to save energy and capital cost; (2) Improving operability of thermally coupled columns by means of eliminating vapor streams in thermal couplings with only liquid transfers or column section rearrangement; (3) Enabling double and multi-effect distillation of thermally coupled configurations to further reduce heat duty; (4) Performing simultaneous heat and mass integration among thermally coupled columns to reduce the number of columns and heat duty; and (5) Conducting any thermally coupled distillation in n-product streams using 1 to n\n                     \u22122 column shells with operable novel dividing wall columns. We demonstrate these aspects of PI through examples to illustrate how they lead to compact, easy-to-operate, energy efficient and cost effective multicomponent distillation system designs."}{"A review on mechanical activation and mechanical alloying in stirred media mill ": "Comminution in stirred media mills is a frequently applied top-down method towards the production of micron- and submicron particles. However, due to the high energy density, this type of mill is appropriate for mechanical activation (MA) as well. Despite the vast field of mechanochemistry which encompasses an increase in reactivity by mechanical energy input, there is only limited publication on stirred media mill-based MA until now. The main focus of this paper is the short introduction of MA and review of the above field related to the mentioned mill type. It can be identified as a general conclusion that this recently introduced mill is not yet applied in a wide range in MA compared to other high energy density mills (HEM) like planetary ball mill or vibratory mill which have been used since long time. However, the results published on the mechanical activation in stirred media mill seems very promising which is forecasted the increase of publication in number in the future. The basis for this lies in its high energy density (3\u202610 times higher than other HEM), the ability of continuous operation, high number of operating parameters (circumferential velocity, ball size, material, wet or dry state, drying in the mill, \u2026) makes it a well controllable method for the manufacture of high value added products such as advanced materials or various composites."}{"An overview on control strategies for CO2 capture using absorption/stripping system ": "CO2 removal via absorption/stripping system using chemical solvents is a widely acknowledged technology for CO2 capture, either from natural gas or post-combustion processes. It offers higher capture efficiency. However, one of its main drawbacks is the high energy consumption in the regeneration step. Besides, for solvent-based absorption/stripping plant, the units feature nonlinearities as well as high process interactions. Hence, control strategies are crucial in the operational optimization of process set-point changes and disturbance rejections as well as reduction in the operational costs of such systems. Process control systems are key in processing plants as they direct production processes, minimise variations and regulate product consistency. In this paper, an overview on the related efforts that have been carried out in terms of basic and advanced process control strategies are reviewed to provide further understanding on the key features that are required to optimize the operation of the absorption/stripping system."}{"Investigation of hydrodynamic behavior in random packing using CFD simulation ": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of countercurrent gas\u2013liquid flow in random packings of Raschig rings were carried out in this study. This model used gravity simulation to construct the random packing structure, and a volume expansion-recovery method to improve the meshing quality. A simple feedback control scheme was applied to control the gas inlet flow rate so that pressure drop can be estimated. The generated characteristics of the packing structure such as the number of packing elements, dry surface area and porosity were found to be close to experiments. CFD predictions of hydrodynamics properties are also validated by the experimental data using a small column section. The results indicate that our CFD model was able to capture the essential hydrodynamics behavior of the gas\u2013liquid countercurrent flow. Hence, the approach presented in this study can be used as a basis for studying the effect of detailed packing-geometry design on hydrodynamic and mass transfer characteristics."}{"Boron adsorption removal by commercial and modified activated carbons ": "Although being an essential element for plants, animals, and people, due to its many industrial applications boron content in the environment exceeds its safe levels. In this paper, the results of the studies on the effectiveness of various commercial activated carbons (CACs) in the purification of water from dissolved boron compounds are presented. To further improve boron adsorptive capacity, the CAC was modified with polyhydric chelates and the as-formed adsorbents were characterized by SEM and BET analysis. The influence of various operating factors on the adsorption of boron was investigated, including a contact time, pH of solution, initial boron concentration and temperature. Batch studies revealed that the pH of solution is a key factor affecting boron removal, and the most efficient adsorption is observed at the pH of 8.5. The adsorption was found out to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, with the equilibrium state achieved within 4\u2009h. The results indicated the exothermic and non-spontaneous nature of adsorption, the reduction of the entropy of the system, as well as the presence of a mixed, physical and chemical adsorption mechanism. Consequently, CAC modified by mannitol or xylitol is shown to serve as an efficient adsorbent for boron removal from polluted water."}{"Physicochemical properties of choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents and excess properties of their pseudo-binary mixtures with 1-butanol ": "Ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents have aroused interest as alternative solvents for separation processes due to their favourable properties. For instance, deep eutectic solvents are usually biodegradable, non-toxic, low cost and also share some properties with ionic liquids, such as their tuneability to be used in specific applications. Recently, deep eutectic solvents have been studied more extensively but their physicochemical characterization is still in the initial stages if the final objective is to select alternatives for industrial processes. Decomposition temperature, surface tension, density, and viscosity were measured for deep eutectic solvents based on choline chloride as the hydrogen bond acceptor and levulinic acid, ethylene glycol and phenol as hydrogen bond donors (in a 1:2\u202fmol ratio). Density, viscosity and excess enthalpy were measured for pseudo-binary mixtures of the different deep eutectic solvents with 1-butanol. The excess properties were calculated to understand the behaviour of the deep eutectic solvents in the mixture. The results suggest that deep eutectic solvents are formed due to strong intermolecular forces between their constituents, with no reaction observed. This generates a higher thermal stability of the deep eutectic solvents compared to their constituent hydrogen bond donor. Also, with the addition of 1-butanol to the deep eutectic solvents, the mixture has a lower volume compared with the ideal case due to the creation of new networks of hydrogen bonds and interstitial site accommodations. Hence, the excess molar volumes and excess enthalpies have a negative deviation from the ideal behaviour. The viscosity deviation is related to the Arrhenius equation observing a negative deviation for the deep eutectic solvents containing levulinic acid and phenol, and a positive deviation for the one with ethylene glycol. Experimental data for the different properties allows a qualitative understanding of the magnitude of the interactions that occur when mixing deep eutectic solvents with 1-butanol."}{"Solubility and thermodynamic properties of NH3 in choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents ": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), derived from the mixtures of two or more hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD), were extensively reported as gas absorbents. In this work, four kinds of DESs were prepared from choline chloride (HBA) and glycerol, ethylene glycol, N-methylurea, and trifluoroacetamide. The molar ratio was fixed at 1:2 of choline chloride to HBD. New experimental results were reported for the solubility of NH3 in these DES over the temperature range of (303.15\u2013333.15)\u202fK and pressures up to 580\u202fkPa using isochoric saturation method. The molarity of NH3 in the DESs ranges up to 16.27\u202fmol.kg\n                     \u22121. The dependence of the NH3 solubility in the DESs on temperature and pressure were accurately represented by Henry\u2019s law model. Standard Gibbs energy, dissolution enthalpy and dissolution entropy were further deduced from Henry\u2019s law constant of NH3 in the DESs."}{"A force field for MD simulations on rhenium organometallic compounds developed from enthalpy of sublimation and X-ray diffraction measurements ": "The standard (p\u00b0\u202f=\u202f0.1\u202fMPa) molar enthalpies of sublimation, at 298.15\u202fK, of methyltrioxorhenium(VII), \n                        \n                           \n                              \u0394\n                              sub\n                           \n                           \n                              H\n                              \n                                 m\n                              \n                              o\n                           \n                        \n                     [CH3ReO3]\u202f=\u202f70.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4\u202fkJ\u202fmol\u22121, and dirhenium decacarbonyl, \n                        \n                           \n                              \u0394\n                              sub\n                           \n                           \n                              H\n                              \n                                 m\n                              \n                              o\n                           \n                        \n                     [Re2(CO)10]\u202f=\u202f97.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.9\u202fkJ\u202fmol\u22121, corresponding to well characterized crystalline phases, were determined by Calvet microcalorimetry.

The new parametrization was able to reproduce the enthalpies of sublimation and unit cell parameters of the test set with maximum absolute deviations of 3.3\u202fkJ\u22c5mol\u22121 and <3.8%, respectively. The transferability of the interaction (\u03b5) and atomic diameter (\u03c3) parameters of the Lennard-Jones (12\u20136) potential function, observed for first and second-row transition metals, was also found to be valid for rhenium and tungsten (third-row metals)."}{"Liquid-liquid extraction of methanol from its mixtures with hexane using three imidazolium-based ionic liquids ": "N-hexane plays a significant role in the industrial manufacturing process of methanol. The separation of n-hexane and methanol is important and difficult due to the azeotropic phenomenon. The objective of this work is to measure the experimental data for the three ternary systems n-hexane\u202f+\u202fmethanol\u202f+\u202fionic liquids (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl), 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate) at T\u202f=\u202f298.15\u202fK and 101.3\u202fkPa. The COSMO-SAC model was used to calculate the infinite dilution activity coefficients of the eleven ILs in the work and in the literature. The liquid-liquid equilibrium data for the ternary systems were compared with the calculated values obtained using the non-random two liquid and universal quasi-chemical activity models, and the binary interaction parameters of the two models were obtained by regressing the experimental data. Comparing the values of the distribution coefficients and separation factors of the three ILs, 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide showed the best extraction effect. The influence of the alkyl chain length and different anions on the liquid-liquid equilibrium data was discussed."}{"Prediction of clathrate hydrate phase equilibria using gradient boosted regression trees and deep neural networks ": "Clathrate hydrate phase equilibrium is one of its most important basic physical properties, and numerous experiments and models have been studied. In this study, the gradient boosted regression tree algorithm was first applied to predict hydrate phase equilibrium conditions with multiple components in the presence of various salts, organics or pure water. In addition, a deep neural network algorithm was also used for comparison. A total of 1805 sets of experimental data were used as training sets for the modeling, and 136 sets of data were used to test the model. The input of the model includes 11 guest components, 9 kinds of salts, and 8 types of organics. Meanwhile, one representative temperature and pressure was set as the input, and the other was set as the output. The prediction results showed that the coefficients of determination (R2) of the pressure models were higher than 99.00%, the average absolute relative deviation was below 20.00%, and the average relative deviation was below 8.00%. Furthermore, the temperature model had an R2 of 99.90%, an average absolute relative deviation of 0.30% or better, and an average relative deviation of approximately 0.00%. Overall, the prediction of the temperature model was the best in this study. Furthermore, the accuracy of these models was satisfactory compared to the values in the literature."}{"Heat capacity and thermodynamic functions of crystalline forms of the metal-organic framework zinc 2-methylimidazolate, Zn(MeIm)2\n             ": "Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are composed of metal atoms connected with imidazole-like linkers, and these frameworks have potential for applications in molecular sieving, gas sequestration, and catalysis. In addition, these materials form true polymorphs with the same chemical composition but different topologies. In this paper, we present the results of low temperature heat capacity and inelastic neutron scattering studies of the sodalite (SOD) and diamondoid (dia) topologies of the popular zinc 2-methylimidazolate framework, Zn(MeIm)2. Molar heat capacities from 1.8\u202fK to 300\u202fK are presented, along with theoretical fits and the values of Cp,m\n                     \u00b0, \u03940\n                     T\n                     S\n                     m\u00b0, \u03940\n                     T\n                     H\n                     m\u00b0, and\n                     \u03a6\n                     m\u00b0calculated from those fits. The Gibbs energy of the transformation from SOD to dia is \u2212(4.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.2)\u202fkJ, and this transformation is primarily enthalpically driven. The results of this study are compared with previous measurements on the zinc 2-ethylimidazolate framework, Zn(EtIm)2. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements confirm the presence of low energy modes and suggest that the higher heat capacity of SOD at low temperatures is due to the dynamics of the methyl groups on the methylimidazolate linkers."}{"Evaluating the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles on traffic safety ": "This study aims to analyze the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) on traffic safety under various penetration rates. Based on a recently proposed heterogeneous flow model, the mixed traffic flow with both conventional vehicles and CAVs was simulated and studied. The frequency of dangerous situations and value of time-to-collision in the mixed traffic flow under different CAV penetration rates was calculated and used as indicators of CAV\u2019s impact on traffic safety. Acceleration rate and velocity difference distribution of the mixed traffic flow was presented to show the evolution of mixed traffic flow dynamics with the increase in CAV penetration rates within the mixed flow. Results show that the condition of traffic safety is greatly improved with the increase in the CAV penetration rate. More cautious car-following strategy of the CAV would contribute to a greater benefit on traffic safety, though less gain in capacity. With the increase in CAV penetration rate, the portion of smooth driving is increased. Velocity difference between vehicles is decreased and traffic flow is greatly smoothed. Stop-and-go traffic will be greatly eased."}{"Modeling financial time-series with generative adversarial networks ": "Financial time-series modeling is a challenging problem as it retains various complex statistical properties and the mechanism behind the process is unrevealed to a large extent. In this paper, a deep neural networks based approach, generative adversarial networks (GANs) for financial time-series modeling is presented. GANs learn the properties of data and generate realistic data in a data-driven manner. The GAN model produces a time-series that recovers the statistical properties of financial time-series such as the linear unpredictability, the heavy-tailed price return distribution, volatility clustering, leverage effects, the coarse-fine volatility correlation, and the gain/loss asymmetry."}{"Spatial spillover and impact factors of the internet finance development in China ": "Using the social network analysis and quadratic assignment procedure method, this paper analyzes the network characteristic and impact factors of internet finance development in China. Some interesting findings emerge that: (i) the network characteristic exists in China\u2019s regional internet finance development; (ii) some provinces, such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, Beijing, are at the core position of the network and play the leading role of China\u2019s internet finance development; (iii) the spillover is mainly caused by the provinces located in the coastal area in China, and the relationships out of the blocks are far more than it intra block; (iv) the difference in economic development, industrial structure, traditional finance development level, and geography distance have a significant negative effect on the spillover of IF development. Our results may have some implications for policymakers."}{"A review of cellular automata models for crowd evacuation ": "With the increasing of risk potential in crowded places, evacuation management becomes practically important to ensure the safety of crowds. The studies of crowd evacuation in normal or emergency situations have become a hot topic. Due to the distinct advantages of high efficiency, strong scalability and simple implementation, cellular automata models (CA) have become one of the most widely-used models for evacuation. However, the practical requirements of evacuation propose some important challenges for CA models, for example, to accurately characterize both position and velocity of individuals, to depict environments and accidents, and to describe human behaviors. In the last 20 years, there are many studies aiming at resolving the above challenges. Starting from the challenges mentioned above, this paper tries to give a review of CA models, specially used for crowd evacuation. Firstly, we give an overview of CA models for evacuation, and put forward research paradigm, modeling framework and classification of CA models. The models used for evacuation are classified into three kinds of categories, i.e. lattice gas model, floor field model, and other field-based models. The last category includes potential field model, electrostatic-induced potential field model, cost potential field model, etc. Then, three main challenges of CA models for evacuation are presented, and the improvements for each type of challenge are summarized. Typical simulation scenarios and research issues are further proposed. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of CA models are illustrated from the aspects of implementation, performance, scalability, accuracy and applicability."}{"An evolutionary game model for analysis of rumor propagation and control in social networks ": "Nowadays, social networks are widely used as fast and ubiquitous media for sharing information. Rumor as unverified information also considerably spreads in social networks. The study of how rumor spreads and how it can be controlled, plays an important role in reducing social and psychological damages of rumor in social networks. Although recent researches have mainly focused on epidemic models and structure of social networks, they ignore the impact of people\u2019s decision on rumor process. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is proposed to analyze the rumor process in social network considering the impacts of people\u2019s decisions on rumor propagation and control. The model considers a rumor control mechanism via sending anti-rumor messages through rumor control centers. Factors affecting the people\u2019s decisions including social anxiety, people\u2019s attitude toward rumor/anti-rumor, strength of rumor/anti-rumor, influence of rumor control centers, and participation of people in discussions are studied in the model. The proposed game model is analyzed by replicator dynamics equations and simulation of the imitation update rule on a synthetic (Barabasi\u2013Albert) and two real-world graphs of Twitter and Facebook. We further analyze the model in various environments considering people characteristics and society situation. Also we use a real rumor dataset of Twitter (Pheme dataset) to first compare the trends of people strategies (rumor/anti-rumor spreader and ignorant) derived by the model with the real trends of the traits of people in the rumor spreading on Twitter. Then we conduct a number of sensitivity analysis experiments to show the impact of different factors on rumor process. In fact, we analyze the trends of people strategies in Pheme dataset assuming various possible conditions. The analysis show that propagation of convincing anti-rumor messages and locating rumor control centers impact debunking the rumor. Moreover, it is shown that people attitude toward rumor/anti-rumor has significant impact on rumor spreading. Besides, factors such as social anxiety and strength of rumor accelerates rumor propagation."}{"Change agents and internal communications in organizational networks ": "The adoption of change in organizational networks is conditioned by the engagement of the so-called \u201cchange agents\u201d initiating \u201ccascades of change\u201d, as well as by the internal communication among the members of the network. We investigate how the dynamics of the adoption of change is influenced by the engagement policy of the change agents and by the internal communication. In this perspective, we compare central engagements (high degree, high closeness, high betweenness, high eigen-centrality) with random engagement. We also compare three selection rules for communication, namely: selection by randomness, selection by high link weight, and selection by high link weight and degree centrality. The dynamics of change adoption is modeled by generalizing the discrete diffusion equation in order to incorporate both the engagement policies of the change agents and the internal communication rules. Results are obtained by simulating the solutions (change management scenaria) on 4 real organizational networks. Agents with high degree (hubs) are found to be most suitable to act as change agents. The most suitable change agents however, are not always the senior employees. The adoption of change is much faster, if agents communicate with \u201clocal hubs\u201d, avoiding random contacts. Change agents feed the members of the network with \u201cthin slices\u201d of influence, in order to avoid crossing the \u201cconfidence bound\u201d. Small increase of the size of \u201cslices\u201d, results in significant acceleration of the adoption of change. We also estimate the value of \u201cplanning\u201d versus \u201cno planning\u201d, in the context of Change Management."}{"Viral marketing on social networks: An epidemiological perspective ": "Omnipresent online social media nowadays has a constantly growing influence on business, politics, and society. Understanding these newer mechanisms of information diffusion is very important for deciding campaign policies. Due to free interaction among a large number of members, information diffusion on social media has various characteristics similar to an epidemic. In this paper, we propose and analyze a mathematical model to understand the phenomena of digital marketing with an epidemiological approach considering some realistic interactions in a social network. We apply mean-field approach as well as network analysis to investigate the phenomenon for both homogeneous and heterogeneous models, and study the diffusion dynamics as well as equilibrium states for both the cases. We explore the parameter space and design strategies to run an advertisement campaign with substantial efficiency. Moreover, we observe the phenomena of bistability, following which we estimate the necessary conditions to make a campaign more sustainable while ensuring its viral spread."}{"Forecasting the Chinese stock volatility across global stock markets ": "In view of the growing concern of Chinese stock fluctuation, this paper forecasts the Chinese stock volatility by extracting global stock information by combining forecasts of time-varying parameter (TVP) volatility models. First, we construct individual constant coefficient (CC) models and TVP models across 27 global stock markets, and then use several strategies to combine their forecasts. The results show global stock information does forecast the future volatility of Chinese stock market. Both the forecast accuracy and economic values can be further improved by using strategies combining TVP models with global stock information. Specifically, the median combination shows its superiority for the volatile Chinese stock market. Our findings are robust to different estimation window sizes, volatility proxies, and evaluation criteria."}{"A tale of two tails: Do Power Law and Lognormal models fit firm-size distributions in the mid-Victorian era? ": "The paper explores the frequency and size distributions of firm-size in a novel dataset for the mid-Victorian era from a recent extraction of the England and Wales population censuses of 1851, 1861, 1871, and 1881. The paper contrasts the hypothesis of the Power Laws against the Lognormal model for the tails of the distributions using maximum likelihood estimation, log likelihood ratio, clipped sample coefficient of variation UMPU-Wilks test, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov statistic, among other state-of-the-art statistical methods. Our results show that the Power Law hypothesis is accepted for the size distribution for the years 1851 and 1861, while 1871 is marginally non-significant, but for 1881 the test is inconclusive. The paper discusses the process that generates these distributions citing recent literature that shows how after adding an i.i.d. noise to the Gibrat\u2019s multiplicative model one can recreate a Power Law behaviour. Overall, the paper provides, describes and statistically tests for the very first time a unique historical dataset confirming that the tails of the distributions at least for 1851 and 1861 follow a Pareto model and that the Lognormal model is firmly rejected."}{"High irradiance performance of cesium-formamidinium-based mixed-halide perovskite for concentrator photovoltaics under various operating conditions ": "Solar concentrator has been successfully implemented in photovoltaic (PV) technologies to deliver high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, this interesting approach has not been sufficiently investigated so far for perovskites solar cells (PSCs), in spite of its frequent use in the field of inorganic semiconductor solar cells. Herein, we evaluate the feasibility of using cesium-formamidinium-based mixed-halide perovskite for Concentrator photovoltaics (CPVs), we assess their performance parameters under concentrated irradiance, and we derive the temperature sensitivity of perovskite concentrator solar cells (PCSCs). A combined opto-electronic model is developed to improve the proposed perovskite solar cell (PSC) device and achieve the highest possible efficiencies. Simulation results show that PSC can exhibit appreciably higher PCE under a wide range of light intensities, and reaches a peak efficiency of 24.93% under 40 Suns, as compared to 22.46% under 1 Sun. Importantly, the temperature sensitivity of PCE of PSC reduces under solar concentration. Therefore, our work reveals that solar concentrator could be the possible new developing guidance for PSCs to reach higher PCEs and reduce cost."}{"PVP modified Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles as a new adsorbent for hydrophobic substances ": "In this work, superparamagnetic Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with high saturation magnetization (Ms) were synthesized. The NPs had core-shell structures with magnetic Fe3O4 as the core and SiO2 as the shell. The magnetic core was firstly prepared with miniemulsion method, then SiO2 shell was synthesized by St\u00f6ber method. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) modified Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs were a new adsorbent material for hydrophobic substances in water environments. The original and PVP modified Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs were characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), as well as Brunauer\u2013Emmet\u2013Teller (BET). The Ms of the original and modified Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs were 30.78 emu\u00b7g\u22121 and 30.89 emu\u00b7g\u22121, respectively. XPS certified that PVP molecules were embedded in the shell of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs, owing to PVP used in preparation of Fe3O4 nanocluster as a protective agent. After modification, besides in SiO2 shell, PVP was also found on the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs. AFM images showed that column-shaped admicelles formed upon the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs. Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs surface area reduced considerably from 88.74 to 60.82\u202fm2\u202fg\u22121, which verified large aggregations formed on the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs. Hydrophobic interaction helped phenanthrene (as a representative of hydrophobic substance) to be adsolubilized in PVP admicelles. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of PVP modified Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs for phenanthrene was 18.84\u202fmg\u202fg\u22121, 2.01 times as that of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs."}{"Asymmetric supercapacitor based on reduced graphene oxide/MnO2 and polypyrrole deposited on carbon foam derived from melamine sponge ": "Carbon sponges enclosing carbon fibers are prepared by carbonizing the melamine sponges with bunches of carbon fibers sewn in, and used as the substrate and current collector to fabricate asymmetric supercapacitors. MnO2/rGO/CS-CFs as the positive electrode and the PPy/CS-CFs as the negative electrode have been prepared and characterized, and in LiCl/polyvinyl alcohol gel electrolyte, the positive and negative electrodes are used to fabricate the asymmetric supercapacitors. The cells exhibit an operating voltage window of 1.4\u202fV and high specific capacitance of 106.1\u202fF\u202fg\u22121 based on the active materials and high cyclic stability (83.7% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitors in parallel and series connection show good electrical relationships, and two cells in series connection can turn on a light emission device after being charged, indicating the potential practical application."}{"Efficient Fe2O3/C-g-C3N4 Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst prepared by facile one-step carbonizing process ": "Photocatalytic water purification has emerged as new effective ways for an environment preserve and purification in few decades. As a part of studies on photocatalytic water purification, constructing heterojunction structured compounds with different photocatalysts for efficient organic pollutant degradation is regarded as key-strategy. Herein, facile one-step carbonizing process was introduced for synthesizing Fe2O3/C-g-C3N4 based Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst. The two times of photocatalytic organic pollutant degradation rate of Fe2O3/C-g-C3N4 based Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was enhanced comparing with pristine Fe2O3/g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalyst through rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under AM 1.5G (100 mWcm\u22122, 1 sun) illumination. The reasons for enhanced photocatalytic RhB degradation efficiency of Fe2O3/C-g-C3N4 based Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst were revealed to efficient charge transfer during light induced RhB degradation reaction by constructing junction structures among Fe2O3, amorphous carbon layer and g-C3N4, which proved by fluorescence spectroscopy, XPS, SEM, TEM and UV\u2013Vis analysis."}{"Bifunctional perovskite electrocatalyst and PVDF/PET/PVDF separator integrated split test cell for high performance Li-O2 battery ": "In this work, we have studied the electrochemical performance of split test cell based Li-O2 battery using PVDF/PET/PVDF nanofiber non-woven membrane and La0.5Ce0.5Fe0.5Mn0.5O3 perovskite (denoted as LCFMO) air cathode. The LCFMO air cathode is prepared by a simple wet chemical co-precipitation method and the PVDF/PET/PVDF nanofiber separator is synthesized by an electrospinning method. The as-prepared air cathode and PVDF/PET/PVDF separators are assembled in Li-O2 cell and their charge-discharge profile is evaluated at the potential window of 2\u20134.5\u202fV\u202fat 100\u202fmA\u202fg\u22121 with a limited capacity range of 300, 500 and 1000 mAh g\u22121. The result certified that the LCFMO-(Urea) catalyst based Li-O2 battery with PVDF/PET/PVDF separator showed an excellent cycling stability over 263, 147 and 120 cycles, respectively. This is due to the excellent bifunctional activity of LCFMO catalyst and high ionic transport properties of PVDF/PET/PVDF membrane. Also, the use of LiI redox mediator can effectively reduce the both charge and discharge overpotential of our Li-O2 battery system. The optimal pore size, higher porosity and good ionic conductivity of the PVDF/PET/PVDF membrane is also an essential factor for the enhanced performance of Li-O2 battery. In addition, AC impedance study evidenced that the Li-O2 battery shows much lower interfacial charge transfer resistance (i.e., lower Rct), which indicates the good electrochemical properties of our proposed materials."}{"Magnetoelectric and HR-STEM investigations on eutectic CoFe2O4\u2013Ba1\u2013xSrxTiO3 composites ": "Multiferroic Ba1\u2013xSrxTiO3\u2013CoFe2O4 (x\u202f=\u202f0.03, 0.05) composites with rarely investigated 3-3 connectivity were prepared by eutectic crystallization in an optical floating zone furnace. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations of the CoFe2O4\u2013BaTiO3 interface revealed an almost perfect connection between both components. These micrographs also showed that the impact of post-annealing in air was much larger than expected and resulted in formation of small BaTiO3 inclusions in the CoFe2O4 phase. The magnetoelectric coefficient \u03b1ME was studied in detail with respect to its dependence on the static magnetic field, the frequency of the driving AC-field and temperature. Furthermore, the influence of different growth rates (5, 10 and 20\u202fmm\u202fh\u22121), chemical composition, sample thickness and the alignment of electrical polarization and magnetic field (collinear or vertical) on the magnetoelectric properties were studied. The largest value of \u03b1ME\u202f=\u202f1.3\u202fmV\u202fOe\u22121\u202fcm\u22121 was found for a sample grown at 5\u202fmm\u202fh\u22121. For even slower growth rates, a higher Sr content was required to avoid the formation of impurity phases leading to a decrease of \u03b1ME."}{"Facile synthesis of the 3D framework Si@N-doped C/Reduced graphene oxide composite by polymer network method for highly stable lithium storage ": "Silicon (Si) has received sustained attention as an anode electrode material for Li-ion batteries (LIBs). However, Si is extremely limited by rapid capacity decay due to considerable changes in the structure during lithiation/delithiation. A 3D framework Si@N-doped C/reduced graphene oxide (Si@NC/rGO) composite has been facilely prepared by a novel polymer network method by using GO, Si nanoparticles, polymer monomers (acrylic amide), and networking agents (N,N\u2032-methylene bisacrylamide) as the raw materials, followed by carbonization under an Ar atmosphere. After the crosslinking reaction, approximately 30\u202fnm Si nanoparticles are embedded in the 3D NC/rGO framework. The Si@NC/rGO composite has a large reversible specific capacity, good cycle stability, and excellent rate performance as an anode electrode material for LIBs. The specific capacity is maintained at 867.4 and 479.1\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg\u22121\u202fat 0.1 and 2\u202fA\u202fg\u22121 after the 200 cycles, respectively. The capacity is three to fourfold higher than that of commercial graphite anode materials. The excellent electrical properties are mainly ascribed to the collaboration of the C framework and the high electrical conductivity of graphene and N doping. The Si@NC/rGO composite shows growth potential as anode electrode materials for LIBs."}{"Excellent cyclic performance of Fe2O3@C/SnO2 controlled by Fe2O3@C and SnO2/C hybrid structures for lithium-ion batteries ": "A ternary nanocomposite Fe2O3@C/SnO2 is synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal method with further annealing. The crystallinity, micromorphology, and electrochemical performance of Fe2O3@C/SnO2 nanocomposite are systematically characterized. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement demonstrates that Fe2O3@C/SnO2 exhibits good rate discharge capacity. It shows a reversible capacity of 540 mAh g\u22121 after 1000 cycles operated at a current density of 1000\u202fmA\u202fg\u22121, with higher Coulombic efficiency. The excellent electrochemical properties of Fe2O3@C/SnO2 maybe are related to the hybrid structure, in which the carbon layer encloses the needle Fe2O3, meanwhile, the SnO2 nanoparticles disperse into carbon layer. The carbon layer effectively refines the pulverization of SnO2 nanoparticles and avoids the aggregation. The carbon layer loaded SnO2 encircles Fe2O3, which effectively accommodates the internal stress of volume expansion of Fe2O3. The results demonstrate that such the nanocomposite developed here has great potential for application in high-energy lithium-ion batteries."}{"First-principles investigations of electronic and optical properties in the MoS2/CsPbBr3 heterostructure ": "There has been great interest inhow to boost the performance of perovskite solar cells effectively. Building heterostructures between layered two-dimensional materials and perovskites is a common way to achieve the goal. In this work, the electronic and optical properties of the MoS2/CsPbBr3 heterostructure are studied systematically by density functional theory calculations. The calculated results show that the heterostructure can effectively retain some of the excellent properties of individual MoS2 and CsPbBr3. Furthermore, the optical performance of the two kinds of interfaces\u2014CsBr/MoS2 contact and PbBr2/MoS2 contact\u2014is better than that of the individual perovskite layers. We attribute the increased light absorption to the type II electronic band alignment of the heterostructure, interfacial charge transfer, and electron-hole separation. This work may be beneficial for improving the properties of perovskite solar cells and may open a way for the theoretical exploration of inorganic perovskite\u2013based heterostructures."}{"Modification of g-C3N4 quantum dots by Ni\u2013Ni3C@C nanoparticles for hydrogen production ": "A rational design of noble-metal-free cocatalyst plays an important role in the potential application of g-C3N4 for hydrogen production using solar energy. In this work, graphitic carbon covered Ni\u2013Ni3C (Ni\u2013Ni3C@C) nanoparticles were used as cocatalyst for visible light-driven H2 production over g-C3N4 quantum dots (CNQD). Ni\u2013Ni3C@C/CNQD composite can promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus bringing about a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance. The H2-production rate of the optimal Ni\u2013Ni3C@C/CNQD composite is approximately 86 times higher than that of pure CNQD. Our work will provide new insights for the application of metal carbide as a noble-metal-free cocatalyst in photocatalytic system."}{"Is there a big mantle wedge under eastern Tibet? ": "The big mantle wedge (BMW) model was originally proposed to explain the origin of the intraplate Changbaishan volcano in NE China where the subducting Pacific slab becomes stagnant in the lower part of the mantle transition zone (MTZ). The BMW is defined as a broad region in the upper mantle and upper part of the MTZ overlying the long stagnant Pacific slab. Under eastern Tibet, prominent low-velocity (low-V) anomalies are revealed in the upper mantle, whereas an obvious and broad high-velocity (high-V) anomaly is imaged in the MTZ from the Burma arc northward to the Kunlunshan fault zone and eastward to the Xiaojiang fault zone. In addition, receiver-function analyses clearly illustrate a thickened MTZ in a similar area. Hence we conclude that there is a BMW structure under eastern Tibet, which can explain the deep origin of the Tengchong volcano and generation of large crustal earthquakes in the region. The Tengchong volcano is caused by hot and wet mantle upwelling in the BMW and fluids from dehydration reactions of the stagnant Indian slab in the MTZ. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Ms 8.0) took place in a transitional belt from the low-V Songpan-Ganzi block to the high-V Sichuan basin, suggesting that the occurrence of the Wenchuan earthquake was affected by the BMW structure. These results shed new light on the mantle structure and dynamics under eastern Tibet."}{"Deep learning for seismic phase detection and picking in the aftershock zone of 2008 M\n               \n                  w\n               7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake ": "The increasing volume of seismic data from long-term continuous monitoring motivates the development of algorithms based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for faster and more reliable phase detection and picking. However, many less studied regions lack a significant amount of labeled events needed for traditional CNN approaches. In this paper, we present a CNN-based Phase-Identification Classifier (CPIC) designed for phase detection and picking on small to medium sized training datasets. When trained on 30,146 labeled phases and applied to one-month of continuous recordings during the aftershock sequences of the 2008 MW\u202f7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan, China, CPIC detects 97.5% of the manually picked phases in the standard catalog and predicts their arrival times with a five-times improvement over the ObsPy AR picker. In addition, unlike other CNN-based approaches that require millions of training samples, when the off-line training set size of CPIC is reduced to only a few thousand training samples the accuracy stays above 95%. The deployment of CPIC takes less than 12\u202fh to pick arrivals in 31-day recordings on 14 stations. In addition to the catalog phases manually picked by analysts, CPIC finds more phases for existing events and new events missed in the catalog. Among those additional detections, some are confirmed by a matched filter method while others require further investigation. Finally, when tested on a small dataset from a different region (Oklahoma, US), CPIC achieves 97% accuracy after fine tuning only the fully connected layer of the model. This result suggests that the CPIC developed in this study can be used to identify and pick P/S arrivals in other regions with no or minimum labeled phases."}{"Complex subduction beneath the Tibetan plateau: A slab warping model ": "Morphology of the subducting Indian lithosphere beneath Tibet is the key to understanding the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan plateau. In the present study we determine three-dimensional P-wave velocity images of the mantle under the entire Tibetan plateau and its adjacent areas by inverting ~200,000 teleseismic relative travel-time residuals recorded at 893 stations belonging to >32 portable seismic networks deployed in and around the plateau. An east-west varying high-velocity anomaly with a large dip angle down to the mantle transition zone is revealed clearly, which represents the subducting Indian slab. On the basis of the tomographic results, we propose a slab warping model to describe the complex subduction of the Indian plate beneath the plateau, which is characterized by lateral bending in addition to downward subduction. The complex geometry of the present Indian slab is possibly caused by non-uniform pulling of an earlier subducted slab in a process with the Indian slab detachment propagating laterally. As a result, a warping arc has formed beneath the Himalaya block to keep the Indian lithosphere intact. This slab warping model agrees well with many observations, such as magmatism and surface deformations in the western and southern Tibetan plateau."}{"P and S wave travel time tomography of the SE Asia-Australia collision zone ": "The southeast (SE) Asia - Australia collision zone is one of the most tectonically active and seismogenic regions in the world. Here, we present new 3-D P- and S-wave velocity models of the crust and upper mantle by applying regional earthquake travel-time tomography to global catalogue data. We first re-locate earthquakes provided by the standard ISC-Reviewed and ISC-EHB catalogues using a non-linear oct-tree scheme. A machine learning algorithm that clusters earthquakes depending on their spatiotemporal density was then applied to significantly improve the consistency of travel-time picks. We used the Fast Marching Tomography software package to retrieve 3-D velocity and interface structures from starting 1-D velocity and Moho models. Synthetic resolution and sensitivity tests demonstrate that the final models are robust, with P-wave speed variations (~130\u202fkm horizontal resolution) generally recovered more robustly than S-wave speed variations (~220\u202fkm horizontal resolution). The retrieved crust and mantle anomalies offer a new perspective on the broad-scale tectonic setting and underlying mantle architecture of SE Asia. While we observe clear evidence of subducted slabs as high velocity anomalies penetrating into the mantle along the Sunda arc, Banda arc and Halmahera arc, we also see evidence for slab gaps or holes in the vicinity of east Java. In the Banda arc, we image the slab as a single curved subduction zone. Furthermore, a high-velocity region in the mantle lithosphere connects northern Australia with Timor and West Papua. The S-wave model shows broad-scale features similar to those of the P-wave model, with mantle earthquakes generally distributed within high-velocity slabs. The high velocity mantle connection between northern Australia and the eastern margin of the Sunda arc is also present in the S-wave model. While the S-wave model has a lower resolution than the P-wave model due to the availability of fewer paths, it nonetheless provides new and complementary insights into the structure of the upper mantle beneath southeast Asia."}{"High pressure thermoelasticity and sound velocities of Fe-Ni-Si alloys ": "The Earth's iron-dominant core is known to contain nickel from cosmochemical analysis and some amount of light elements from geophysical constraints on density and seismic wave velocities. Although there have been several studies to constrain thermoelastic properties of iron-alloys, there has been no systematic study on the effects of nickel and light elements on properties of iron using the same experimental methods and data analysis approach. We conducted nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and X-ray diffraction experiments on body-centered cubic and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Fe0.91Ni0.09 and Fe0.8Ni0.1Si0.1 up to 104\u202fGPa and 86\u202fGPa, respectively, and compare to similar measurements conducted on hcp-Fe up to 171\u202fGPa. Specifically, we determine the Debye sound velocity from the low-energy transfer region of the (partial) phonon density of states (DOS) using the equation of state determined for each material and a new approach which utilizes information criteria and probability distributions. Nickel decreases the shear velocity of iron, while 10 at% Si has little to no effect on the shear velocity of Fe0.91Ni0.09. We observe that the shape of the phonon DOS of these alloys remains similar with increasing pressure. In the measured compression range, we therefore apply a generalized scaling law to describe the volume dependence of the phonon DOS and find that the vibrational Gr\u00fcneisen parameters of hcp-Fe0.91Ni0.09 are nearly indistinguishable from those hcp-Fe and those for Fe0.8Ni0.1Si0.1 trend lower. From the vibrational free energy, we constrain the harmonic vibrational component of thermal pressure, which shows a significant positive deviation from theoretical calculations of hcp-Fe at pressures and temperatures of Earth's core. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the effects of nickel should be considered when modeling iron-rich planetary cores."}{"Crustal structure beneath Northeast China from ambient noise tomography ": "To investigate the deep origin of Cenozoic intraplate volcanism in Northeast (NE) China, especially the Wudalianchi volcanism, a new 3-D S-wave velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle is constructed through ambient noise tomography. Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion curves of 5\u201340\u202fs periods are collected from seismograms recorded at our newly deployed WAVESArray portable stations around the Wudalianchi volcano and NECESSArray portable stations and CEA provincial seismic stations in NE China. Compared to images resolved in previous studies, the addition of WAVESArray data provides much higher resolution in NE China. Under the Songliao, Erlian and Hailar basins, obvious low-velocity (low-V) anomalies are imaged above 5\u202fkm depth, which are well correlated with the sediments and have good correlations with the outlines of the basins. Under the Changbaishan volcano and Abaga and Halaha volcanic groups, low-V anomalies extend continuously down to the uppermost mantle, suggesting their continuous mantle magma provision. Under the Wudalianchi volcano, low-V anomalies above 20\u202fkm depth and in the upper mantle are revealed, but a high-velocity anomaly zone appears in the lower crust, suggesting that the Wudalianchi volcano is a type of mantle origin but parts of magma have been solidified in the lower crust, likely due to intermittent mantle magma provision. All these results indicate that the intraplate volcanism in NE China could be related to complicated mantle dynamics of the big mantle wedge that has been formed due to the stagnancy and dehydration of the subducted Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone."}{"Fate of water in subducted hydrous sediments deduced from stability fields of FeOOH and AlOOH up to 20\u202fGPa ": "Fe- and Al-hydroxides (FeOOH and AlOOH) in sedimentary rocks form the top part of the subducted oceanic lithosphere and are known to be stable along a normal geotherm in the lower mantle. Banded Iron Formations (BIFs) and bauxite ore deposits formed in the Earth's oceans can transport significant amount of water into the Earth's deep interior by subduction of FeOOH and AlOOH and may occasionally serve water to the core. However, stabilities of these hydrous phases have not been well constrained in upper mantle conditions. We determined dehydration curves for FeOOH and AlOOH in upper mantle and mantle transition zone conditions (5\u201320\u202fGPa, 673\u20131573\u202fK) by quench and in situ X-ray diffraction to constrain their capability of water transport to the deep mantle. Dehydration temperatures of these minerals increase with increasing pressure. Comparison between our results and geothermal gradients of subducting slab surfaces demonstrates dehydration of FeOOH in early subduction stage (around 2\u202fGPa). In most cases, diaspore (AlOOH) also dehydrates in early subduction. Despite the implications of the stability of these phases at high pressure, our results show that the sediments located at the slab surface are unlikely candidates for transporting water to the deep mantle."}{"Linear and nonlinear earthquake location approaches in a case study overview ": "Several seismic events are calculated by an iterative, linear algorithm relocated in a nonlinear, grid-search with a maximum-likelihood hypocenter method. The same simultaneous events separately registered by regional and local seismological networks have also been used. A verified 1D (one dimensional) velocity crustal structure model is used in both methods and in all datasets for better comparisons. Some rock quarry blasts registered by the local receiver stations as ground truths are examined by both methods. This study's main objectives were: (i) to carry out a comparative examination of the error estimates in both techniques and (ii) to generalize location assessment of the permanent low-density regional network in Central Alborz. The regional network operates under Iranian Seismological Center and its seismic data are massively applied. To reach the research goals, the dataset\u2013method correlation matrix and the location variables were statistically processed. It was shown that the estimated earthquake epicenters by the linear and nonlinear methods are approximately similar for well-located events in each network. For dense-proper distribution of the seismic stations, the elliptical error estimates have lower amounts and consequently the seismicity pattern is more reliable. The difference between subsurface seismicity patterns resulting from the above-mentioned approaches in the studied area is presented. Some depth calculation errors for the same recorded events are higher in the regional network. The correlation comparisons demonstrated that the nonlinear approach and the locally-constrained data may be closer to reality and more convincing. The nonlinear application is more plausible due to all of the possible solutions and less elliptical error estimates under the Gaussian distribution assumption. Subsequently, the combination of the nonlinear method, proper location criteria, and appropriate crustal velocity structure can effectively improve some of the earthquake location estimates in the regional catalogue. As a result, this procedure can be useful in seismicity concept evaluations."}{"Mechanical coupling of the motion of the surface plate and the lower mantle slab: Effects of viscosity hill, yield strength, and depth-dependent thermal expansivity ": "Sinking rates of the subducted lithosphere in the Earth's lower mantle inferred from seismic tomography images indicate much lower rates than that of the observed subducting surface plate motion. This implies that the surface plate motion is independent of descending flow in the deep mantle. Seeking to understand the mechanical coupling of the slab penetrating into the deepest mantle with the surface plate motion, we performed numerical modeling of the subducting lithosphere integrated into a whole-mantle-scale convection system. Viscosity layering, slab strength, and thermal expansivity were systematically varied using a two-dimensional Cartesian model with a free-surface condition. An increase in the lower mantle viscosity significantly diminished the surface plate motion by stress transmission of the slab when the slab strength was 300\u202fMPa. We observed slab buckling near the 660-km phase transition when the yield stress was 200\u202fMPa. The slab buckling partly absorbed the effects of the lowermost mantle viscosity on the surface plate. Pressure-dependent thermal expansivity further enhanced slab buckling. When the viscosity of the lowermost mantle was less than 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1022\u202fPa\u00b7s, even with a large-viscosity hill in the lower mantle, the slab sinking rate increased up to approximately 7\u202fcm\u202fyr\u22121 when the slab reached the core-mantle boundary region. As a result, the viscosity hill was not sufficient to reduce the sinking rate of the deepest slab. Slab deformation, coupled with gradually increasing viscosity, therefore, plays a key role in the simultaneous occurrence of rapid motion in the surface lithosphere with sluggish slab motion in the deepest layer."}{"Anisotropic high-temperature creep in hydrous olivine single crystals and its geodynamic implications ": "We compile the experimental data on deformation of hydrated olivine single crystal to determine the influence of water and pressure.

We found largely different values of r and V\n                     \u2217 for different orientations (slip systems) implying that the influence of water and pressure is highly anisotropic providing largely different values of r and V\n                     \u2217. For the [110]\n                        c\n                      orientation where the [100](010) slip system is activated, we obtain r\n                     [100]\u202f=\u202f0.35\u202f\u00b10.08, and V\u2217[100]\u202f=\u202f11.0\u202f\u00b1 3.0\u202fcm3/mol, while for the [011]\n                        c\n                      orientation where the [001](010) slip system is activated, r\n                     [001]\u202f=\u202f1.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.30, and V\u2217[001]\u202f=\u202f5.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.6\u202fcm3/mol (for a fixed water content). The highly anisotropic effects of water and pressure suggest that creep in olivine is not controlled solely by diffusion but also controlled by the density of jogs (or kinks) on dislocations that is controlled by water and pressure. We find that the easier slip system changes from the a-slip (slip along the [100] direction) at low water content and low pressure to the c-slip (slip along the [001] direction) at high water content and high pressure, suggesting that the c-slip is softer than the a-slip in most of the asthenosphere, whereas the opposite is true in most of the lithosphere. Implications of these results are discussed using a model of deformation of a polycrystalline aggregate made of anisotropic crystals. It is suggested that in the asthenosphere where most of plastic deformation occurs, short-term time-dependent small strain deformation associated with post-seismic and post-glacial deformation is dominated by the c-slip and strongly dependent on the water content, whereas the long-term large strain deformation associated with mantle convection is dominated by the a-slip that is only weakly dependent on water content."}{"Joint modeling of lithosphere and mantle dynamics: Sensitivity to viscosities within the lithosphere, asthenosphere, transition zone, and D\" layers ": "Although mantle rheology is one of the most important properties of the Earth, how a radial mantle viscosity structure affects lithosphere dynamics is still poorly known, particularly the role of the lithosphere, asthenosphere, transition zone, and D\" layer viscosities. Using constraints from the geoid, plate motions, and strain rates within plate boundary zones, we provide important new refinements to the radial viscosity profile within the key layers of the lithosphere, asthenosphere, transition zone, and D\" layer. We follow the approach of the joint modeling of lithosphere and mantle dynamics (Ghosh and Holt, 2012; Ghosh et al., 2013b, 2019; Wang et al., 2015) to show how the viscosities within these key layers influence lithosphere dynamics. We use the viscosity structure SH08 (Steinberger and Holme, 2008) as a starting model. The density variations within the mantle are derived from the tomography models which, based on prior modeling, had provided a best fit to the surface observables (Wang et al., 2015). Our results show that narrow viscosity ranges of moderately strong lithosphere (2.6\u20135.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f1022\u202fPa-s) and moderately weak transition zone (5\u20139.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f1020\u202fPa-s), as well as slightly large ranges of moderately weak asthenosphere (5\u201334\u202f\u00d7\u202f1019\u202fPa-s) and D\" layer (4.8\u201318\u202f\u00d7\u202f1020\u202fPa-s), are necessary to match all the surface observables. We also find that a very strong lithosphere (>8.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f1022\u202fPa-s) along with a weak asthenosphere (<5.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f1019\u202fPa-s) fits well with the surface observables. Our results show that the geoid is very sensitive to the viscosities of both the transition zone and D\" layer, while plate motions are slightly sensitive to them, but the orientations of stresses are insensitive to them."}{"Nebular atmosphere to magma ocean: A model for volatile capture during Earth accretion ": "The origin and abundance of mantle volatiles present major questions for Earth's evolution. Here we quantify volatile capture from an atmosphere derived from the solar nebula during accretion, using a boundary layer model of magma ocean dynamics coupled to a nebular atmosphere model adapted to Earth formation. Key elements include (i) nebular atmosphere winds based on scaling laws for deep rotating fluids; (ii) water production at the magma surface; and (iii) gas transfer between magma and atmosphere based on the systematics of air-sea gas exchange by wind and diffusion. Provided the Earth accreted to 30% or more of its final mass in the presence of the solar nebula, the mantle is expected to have ingassed several ocean mass equivalents of water plus hydrogen, along with hundreds of petagrams of helium-3 and other light noble gases. In contrast to light gases, nebular ingassing does not provide the mantle with enough heavy noble gases to account for their present-day atmosphere abundances. Our model also predicts that thermal insulation by the nebular atmosphere led to very hot conditions in Earth's interior during accretion, with peak temperatures above 6000\u202fK at the core-mantle boundary and possible dynamo conditions in the Early Hadean."}{"Upper mantle temperature structure of the North China Craton ": "We investigate three-dimensional (3-D) temperature distribution of the upper mantle at depths of 50\u2013200\u202fkm beneath the North China Craton (NCC) and surrounding areas using high-resolution P- and S-wave velocity models as well as mineral physics and geothermal data and methods. The thickness of thermal lithosphere is also estimated assuming its bottom has a mantle adiabatic temperature of 1300\u202f\u00b0C. Our results show that the study area exhibits an alternate distribution pattern with three weak zones and two stable blocks. The Qilian orogen, the Shanxi rift system and the Tanlu fault system are characterized by lower seismic velocity, higher temperature, higher heat flow, and thinner thermal lithosphere. The three mechanically weak zones may be related to subductions of the Indian plate and the Pacific plate beneath the Eurasian continent, resulting in thermochemical erosion of the upwelling asthenospheric material, which have played an important role in the Cenozoic partial destruction of the lithosphere beneath the NCC. The Ordos block and part of the North China Basin have higher seismic velocity, lower temperature and thicker thermal lithosphere, suggesting that the two relatively stable blocks have suffered from less damage and still kept a remanent Archean lithospheric keel."}{"Synthesis of luminescent carbon quantum dots by microplasma process ": "Carbon dots have recently emerged and gained much interest as a new class of carbon nanomaterials especially suited for biological applications owing to their characteristic advantages such as non-toxicity, bio-compatibility, and element abundance. In this study, a fast and effective method was developed for the synthesis of fluorescent carbon dots by microplasma technology, at atmospheric pressure, using isopropanol as the only reactant. Characterizations of the synthesized carbon dots including the investigation of their structure, morphology and optical properties were performed. The results show that the carbon dots produced have a narrow size distribution (average diameter of 1.78\u2009nm) and are amorphous and graphitic in nature. The photoluminescent study indicates that the carbon dots present an excitation-dependent emission property with the excitation wavelengths in a range of 310\u2013410\u2009nm. The high density electrons produced by microplasma induce the chemical reactions and accelerate the formation process of functional groups doped carbon dots."}{"Are supercritical fluids solvents for the future? ": "High pressure technologies involving sub and supercritical fluids offer the possibility to obtain new products with special characteristics or to design new processes which are environmentally friendly and sustainable.\n                  Using high pressure as a processing tool, the legal limitations for solvent residues and restrictions on use of conventional solvents in chemical processes can be avoided. Several sub and supercritical fluid technologies have already been developed to commercial scale. Extraction of valuable compounds from different materials and their \u201cin situ\u201d formulation in products with specific customer designed properties is one of the promising applications of high pressure technology. Particle formation using supercritical fluids overcomes the drawbacks of conventional particle size reduction processes. Unique thermodynamic and fluid-dynamic properties of dense gases can also be used for special impregnation of solid particles and particle coating. Impregnation into aerogels using supercritical carbon dioxide is an excellent way to improve the dissolution and bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs. Some biochemical and chemical reactions performed in supercritical fluids have already been implemented on an industrial scale to obtain products with high added value. In this paper, some relevant applications and expected future development in the field of sub and supercritical fluids are reviewed."}{"Microwave-assisted extraction of phenolics from pomegranate peels: Optimization, kinetics, and comparison with ultrasounds extraction ": "Recently, there has been much interest in the phenolics of pomegranate peels, because of their health benefits, such as antioxidant activity. Thus, the objective of this work is to optimize an efficient alternative and \u201cgreen\u201d technique for the extraction of phenolics from pomegranate peels. Microwave-assisted method was found to increase extraction yield, but mainly to shorten the treatment time by over 60 times compared to conventional extraction methods. The effects of solvent type, solvent/solid ratio, and microwave power on the yield of phenolics extraction were studied. The optimum operating conditions were found to be: solvent type, 50% aqueous ethanol; solvent/solid ratio, 60/1\u2009mL/g; power, 600\u2009W. The efficiency of the proposed extraction protocol was compared with that of the ultrasound-assisted extraction, another \u201cgreen\u201d extraction approach, studied in our previous work. The microwaves method had a yield about 1.7 times higher obtained in a shorter process time (4\u2009min) in comparison to ultrasound-assisted extraction (10\u2009min). These differences were attributed to the intense cell destruction of microwave-treated plant material observed by SEM analysis. The obtained extract presented a high antioxidant activity (radical scavenging activity of 94.91%), due to the high content of punicalagin (143.64\u2009mg/g dry matter) measured by HPLC analysis, that was equivalent to that of the ultrasounds extract (radical scavenging activity, 94.77%; punicalagin content, 138.8\u2009mg/g dry matter)."}{"Microfluidic process intensification for synthesis and formulation in the pharmaceutical industry ": "Process intensification has had an enormous impact on industrial strategy over the last century, with good outcomes for efficiency, safety, environment, and financial cost. Microfluidics offers a relatively new approach that has been studied for 30 years and has become a realistic tool for process intensification in important areas, including pharmaceutical industry. Drug manufacturing and development are expensive, highly regulated, and of great importance to society, due to the health care application. It is therefore a natural target for new technologies that can make pharmaceuticals simultaneously cheaper, more effective, and more accessible, without adverse impact on the environment and health of the workforce. Much work has been done, so this review will necessarily focus on improved pharmaceutical synthesis and drug delivery systems. This review also highlights examples of process intensification and future directions."}{"Experimental and computational investigation of heat transfer in a microwave-assisted flow system ": "Microwave technology is gaining popularity as a tool for chemical process intensification and an alternative to conventional heating. However, in flow systems non-uniform temperature profiles are commonly encountered and hence methods to characterise and improve them are required. In this work, we studied the effects of various operational parameters - microwave power, inlet flow rate, tube orientation and pressure - on the electric field and temperature profiles of water flowing in a PTFE tube (2.4\u202fmm internal diameter), placed in a commercial single-mode microwave applicator. A finite element model was developed to estimate the longitudinal temperature profiles and the absorbed microwave power, while in situ temperature monitoring was performed by a fibre optic probe placed at multiple locations inside the tube. The water temperature inside the tube increased by increasing the microwave power input and temperature profiles stabilised beyond 20\u202fW, while the percentage absorbed microwave power showed the inverse trend. When changing the tube orientation or decreasing the inlet flow rate, microwave absorption decreased significantly. When the pressure was increased to 2.3 bara, water temperature increased by \u223c20\u202f\u00b0C. Results from this study provide valuable insights on achievable temperature profiles and energy efficiency of microwave-assisted flow synthesis systems."}{"One step extraction of essential oils and pectin from pomelo (Citrus grandis) peels ": "Pectin and essential oils (EOs) were simultanuously extracted from pomelo peels by adding citric acid into water used for hydrodistillation of pomelo peels. The effect of citric acid concentrations (0\u20130.55%) on the chemical composition and yield of EOs and pectin yield were investigated. EO yields and the chemical compostion were not significantly affected by citric acid. EO yields were about 1% fresh weight or 4.6% dry weight at all tested concentrations of citric acid. Total monoterpene hydrocarbon content of essential oils in all treatments was not significantly different and within narrow range of 93\u201394.71%, in which limonene, a main component of pomelo EOs, fluctuated around 89%. However, pomelo pectin yield increased with citric acid concentration. It varied from 11 to 24% as citric acid concentration rose from 0 to 0.55% (equivalent to pH from 7.3 to 2.1). In short, hydrodistillation using citric acid solution is a feasible processing method that combines two different extraction processes into one."}{"Heat and water recovery from flue gas: Application of micro-porous ceramic membrane tube bundles in gas-fired power plant ": "Heat and water trans-membrane condenser (HWTMC) consisted of ceramic membrane tube bundles and cooling pathway is a functional apparatus to recover heat and water from flue gas in thermal power plants. In this study, the water and heat-recovery performance of 2\u2009\u03bcm HWTMC on a gas-fired power plant was studied theoretically and experimentally. The simultaneous drop-wise/film-wise condensation heat transfer process was proposed in this study, and we investigated them by installing several temperature sensors within the HWTMC. In addition, the heat and water-recovery performance of HWTMC was evaluated respectively under different operational conditions, and the velocity loss of flue gas was also measured to verify its practicability. The experimental results showed that flue gas temperatures change significantly in the first 2/3 of the HWTMC unit, while barely change at end, especially when they are higher than 103.5\u00b0C. Compared with other operational conditions, moreover, a moderate cooling water inlet flow rate (0.3\u2009m3/h) would result in a remarkable heat and water-recovery performance. To guarantee the efficiency of the experimental HWTMC with total membrane area of 0.145\u2009m2, flue gas flow rate should be set under 500\u2009m3/h. This paper is useful for membrane type waste heat and water-recovery installation design."}{"Continuous aqueous two-phase extraction of microalgal C-phycocyanin using a coiled flow inverter ": "In this study, the intensification of C-phycocyanin protein extraction from the green microalgae Spirulina maxima was successfully achieved using aqueous two-phase systems coupled to different continuous-operation extractors. Three systems with different total concentrations of Polyethylene glycol and potassium phosphate salt were tested in three different types of continuous systems: a conventional straight-tube extractor, a helical-coiled extractor, and a coiled flow inverter extractor. Results showed that the coiled flow inverter extractor achieves higher overall performance than the other continuous extractors at the same flow rate and same residence time for all the concentrations tested. Similarly, all the continuous-operation extractors showed higher extraction performance than a batch-operation extractor for similar times tested. It was observed that extraction performance in the coiled flow inverter increases as flow rate increases (coefficient of partition increases 1.74 fold by increasing the flow rate from 10\u202fmL/min to 30\u202fmL/min). The C-phycocyanin extraction in this continuous system was benefited from a decrease in the extraction time with high Dean numbers."}{"Swing processes for solvent regeneration in liquid-liquid extraction of succinic acid ": "Solvent regeneration processes for liquid-liquid extraction of succinic acid (HSuc) from aqueous streams were investigated. Tri-n-octyl amine (TOA) and tri-n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) showed good extraction. For 20\u202fwt% TOA in MIBK, addition of pentane at anti-solvent-to-solvent ratio of 1 (vol/vol) decreased \n                        \n                           K\n                           D\n                        \n                      from 10.2 to 0.46, applying ethane at 30\u202fbar decreased \n                        \n                           K\n                           D\n                        \n                      to 0.45 and increasing the temperature to 60\u202f\u00b0C decreased \n                        \n                           K\n                           D\n                        \n                      to 1.6.

For these processes, capital investments and energy requirements were calculated for 10 kiloton per year at a concentration factor of 5. Costs of all processes to obtain the product at maximum solubility are less than evaporation (2600\u202fkJ/kg product at maximum solubility). A combination of a swing in diluent and temperature results in higher product concentrations after back-extraction, and reduced the energy input to obtain the pure HSuc to 19\u202fMJ/kg. The ethane-based process is most effective with 13\u202fMJ/kg to obtain the pure HSuc product. Although additional capital investments for compressors and pumps are required, only 110 days of production are required for return on investments."}{"Purification of residual glycerol recovered from biodiesel production ": "Transesterification is the most widely used reaction in the production of biodiesel. It involves the breaking of the triglyceride structure and the exchange of alkyl groups with the hydroxide groups of the alcohol to obtain the new ester (biodiesel). In this process residual glycerol is also produced, but since it is of low purity few alternatives for its application have been identified. In this context, a methodology for the purification of the residual glycerol was developed with a view to adding value to this product and making the process more economically attractive. In this study, residual glycerol was obtained from the transesterification of waste frying oil and of virgin soybean oil in bench scale. The purification method was also applied to residual glycerol obtained from a similar process on industrial scale. The product obtained after each step was characterized to evaluate the contribution of each unit of the operation to the quality of the final product. The results obtained show an increase in the degree of the glycerol purity in each step. It can thus be concluded that the method presented herein can be used to increase the quality of residual glycerol obtained from the biodiesel production process resulting in its acceptable commercial value."}{"Synthesis and optimization of reaction variables in the preparation of pine-magnetite composite for removal of methylene blue dye ": "Purity and quality of water is a basic concern to mankind. The environment is deteriorating daily due to industrial pollution. Dyes discharged together with industrial textile wastewaters are main organic pollutants because they are highly visible and undesirable even at low concentrations in water. Natural biomaterials have been applied previously as adsorbents for dyes from aqueous solution, but their application has been limited by low adsorption capacity. In this study, pine cone biomass, a naturally occurring agricultural waste was treated with 0.15\u202fM NaOH solution to remove unwanted plant extracts and iron oxide magnetic particles which was coated on the pine surface. The main focus of the study was to prepare and optimize the working conditions for the pine magnetite composite. The bionanocomposite material was synthesized by a complete co-precipitation method of Fe2+: Fe3+ (1:2) under alkaline conditions in an inert environment followed by addition of the biomass. The variables used for the experiments were volume of NH4OH varied from 5 to 40\u202fml, reaction temperature varied from 40 to 100\u202f\u00b0C, effect of time varied from 15 to 60\u202fmin and mass from 1.0 to 3.5\u202fg. Incorporation of magnetite nanoparticles onto the surface of the biomass was confirmed by FTIR, TGA and XRD. TEM showed particles size ranging from 8.23\u201311.73\u202fnm. XRF showed the iron oxide content ranging from 57 to 74%."}{"Prediction of maximum oil-yield from almond seed in a chemical industry: A novel type-2 fuzzy logic approach ": "Almond (Termanilia catappa) is one of the most popular tree nuts on a world-wide basis due to its huge benefits in human health. Since it is not readily available in every country, research and investigations are still going on this particular. Therefore, here we have developed a unique model using type-2 fuzzy logic controller (T2FLC) approach to predict the optimum process conditions for the extraction of oil at maximum from almond seeds. Here, we have taken pressure, temperature, heating time and moisture content as input parameters and oil yield is taken as an output parameter to optimize the process. Though hundred percent recovery of oil by extraction of almond seeds is never possible, but controlling the process parameters at suitable condition, oil yield may vary within the range of 40%\u201345%. Using these four input and one output parameters, four Mamdani fuzzy inference systems are formed depending on the different membership functions of the variables. In T2FLC assists to trace inputs and outputs in a well-organized manner for building the inferences train so that various types of oil yield and its assessment can be predicted during extraction. Finally, a statistical analysis has been done using type-2 fuzzy data set to improve the control of process parameters that can be easily determined in the type-2 fuzzy prediction model to get high yield."}{"Response surface methodology approach to optimization of process parameter for coagulation process of surface water using Moringa oleifera seed ": "Recent researches have linked the use of synthetic coagulant for treatment of water with some neurodegenerative and neurotoxic diseases. In view of this, this study focused on the use of an eco-friendly natural coagulant, Moringa oleifera seed for the treatment of surface water. In order to obtain lowest turbidity of surface water, optimization of process variable affecting the coagulation of water was carried out using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Four parameters were varied viz. settling time, agitation time, agitation speed and Moringa oleifera seed extract (MOSE) concentration and their effects on the turbidity of the surface water were established. The data obtained was fitted to a quadratic model which was also validated. The model predicted lowest turbidity of 5.49 NTU with optimal condition of 120\u202fmin of settling time, agitation speed of 100\u202frpm, 10\u202fmin of agitation time and 3\u202fg/l of MOSE concentration. The condition was verified in replicates and turbidity of 5.51 NTU was obtained.

Currently, regular alcohol is used as a feedstock; however, it is known to be toxic. Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate that anhydrous alcohol obtained from palm wine is a potential alternative as the main feedstock for biofuel production. In this study, the aim was to improve the anhydrous alcohol obtained from palm wine based on storage conditions. Although this type of anhydrous alcohol has been previously produced, it is demonstrated that the current method is more efficient than the previous one. The processes implemented in this study were fractionation and extractive distillation. Two numerical simulations were carried out using extractive distillation processes to evaluate of an ethanol and water mixture, that is, ethylene glycol or glyceride. The palm wine was characterized based on the determination of the alcohol content, pH, acidity and the content of free SO2. The alcohol produced was characterized through the determination of its concentration, viscosity and density and infrared spectroscopy analysis. The results illustrate that it is possible to obtain excellent quality anhydrous alcohol suitable for small biofuel production, which is increasingly in demand in rural villages in Sub-Saharan Africa."}{"LVG analysis of amidogen radical (NH2) found in interstellar medium and in cometary material ": "Amidogen (NH2), a b-type asymmetric top molecule with electric dipole moment 1.82\u00a0\u202f\u00b1\u202f\u00a00.05\u00a0Debye, is detected in Sgr B2, in high-mass star-forming regions W31C (G10.6\u22120.4), W49N (G43.2\u22120.1), W51 (G49.5\u22120.4), G34.3+0.1, and in several comets.

Several emission lines produced by amidogen are found. For each species of NH2, we have considered some strongest emission lines along with the observed one, which may help for identification of NH2 in the interstellar medium (ISM) and in the cometary material."}{"Theoretical investigation of methanol formation from methane water-ice cluster following ionization ": "In this article, I have presented quantum mechanical treatment of methanol formation reaction from methane water-ice cluster after ionization with high energy photons. To mimic water ice structure, six water molecules are arranged in hexagonal form. This is the most stable structure formed by six water molecules. Theoretical photodesorption study has been performed on this structure. I have investigated a unique reaction mechanism of methanol formation from methane water ice cluster. I have shown that methanol forms after ionization via two transition states. Hydrogen molecule forms as one of the side product. Initiation of the reaction occurs by dissociation of OH bond in the water cluster followed by CH bond dissociation and formation of CO bond. The timescale of the initial step, which is dissociation of OH bond, has been computed as 50 femtosecond in this article."}{"Hydrogenation reactions and adsorption : From CO to methanol on a graphene surface ": "Successive hydrogenation reactions of isolated CO molecules adsorbed on a bare graphene surface have been studied by density functional theory using a van der Waals functional. Three hydrogenation scenarios, leading to the formation of methanol via the intermediate species: HCO, H2CO, HCOH, H3CO and H2COH, have been considered. Hydrogenation and adsorption energies on the surface have been calculated for all the species. The fractions of molecules released in the gas phase after formation on the surface have been calculated with two different chemical desorption models. Our results show that the fraction of methanol molecules released in the gas phase is low (\u202f<\u202f6%) whatever the scenario. Conversely, the highest fractions of molecules released in the gas phase have been obtained for formaldehyde, H2CO, and the hydroxymethyl radical, H2COH. The methoxy radical, H3CO, is characterized by a high adsorption energy on the substrate (\u22120.337\u00a0eV)."}{"Computational rotational\u2013vibrational spectroscopic analysis of isomeric species in the interstellar gas-phase stereoinversion of amino acid threonine ": "The gas-phase stereoinversion of amino acid threonine under the condition of interstellar medium (ISM) has been predicted to proceed through isomeric species with diverse chemistry. These species including ammonium ylides, epoxides, contain a variety of functional groups such as geminal-diol, triol besides alkenyl, carboxy, keto, hydroxy, and amino groups. The detection of these species in ISM can help in unravelling the enantiomeric excess observed in meteoritic samples. Towards this, the present work reports rotational and vibrational spectroscopic data computed for the conformers and isomeric intermediates predicted along the stereoinversion pathways of proteinogenic threonine under conditions akin to ISM. The rotational parameters are computed using quantum mechanical methods employing M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory whereas for the vibrational analysis, density functional computations are performed using dispersion corrected exchange-correlation functionals. The anharmonic corrections are also computed using vibrational second-order perturbation theory, which, however, fails to account for the hydrogen bonded interactions in the species investigated. The rotational and vibrational transitions predicted for the conformers of threonine are observed to be in good agreement with the available experimental data.

Principal component analysis of the data collected showed that the preheating temperature of the cups contributed to an increased variance of the data and distinguishing pre-heating and non-pre-heating groups. This triggered to study the effect of applying such pre-heating on the physical structure of the material and on the migration of additives to food simulant D1 (ethanol 50% v/v). Several cups were pre-heated at selected temperatures and either analyzed with differential scanning calorimetry to establish the degree of crystallinity or used for the migration test. Six target additives from Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 were quantified in the food simulant using HPLC-FLD and LC\u2013MS. Results show that pre-heating of the beverage cups led to a significant change in the degree of crystallinity, resulting in a change of analyte migration in comparison to the migration results from non-pre-heated cups."}{"Preparation, characterization and antimicrobial properties of electrospun polylactide films containing Allium ursinum L. extract ": "Novel active films of polylactide (PLA) containing extract of Allium ursinum L. (AU), also called wild garlic, at 10\u2009wt% were succesfully prepared by the electrospinning technology. Electrospinning of the AU-containing PLA solutions yielded fibers in the 1\u20132\u2009\u03bcm range with a beaded-like morphology, suggesting that the AU extract was mainly encapsulated in certain fiber regions. The resultant electrospun mats were then subjected to annealing at 135\u2009\u00b0C to obtain continuous films of application interest in active packaging. The film cross-sections revealed that the AU extract was incorporated into the PLA matrix in the form of micro-sized droplets. The thermal properties showed that the AU extract addition plasticized the PLA matrix and also lowered its crystallinity degree as it disrupted the ordering of the PLA chains by hindering their folding into the crystalline lattice. Thermal stability analysis indicated that the natural extract positively contributed to a delay in thermal degradation of the biopolymer and it was thermally stable when encapsulated in the PLA film. The AU extract incorporation also produced a mechanical reinforcement on the electrospun PLA films and improved slightly the water barrier performance. Finally, a significant antimicrobial activity of the electrospun PLA films containing the natural extract was achieved against foodborne bacteria."}{"Thermoplastic starch and green tea blends with LLDPE films for active packaging of meat and oil-based products ": "Thermoplastic starch (TPS) is an alternative biomaterial that can be used to produce bioplastics to replace petroleum-based food packaging. Active films were developed from acetylated cassava TPS and green tea using the blown extrusion process. Green tea (GT) and TPS from native starch (NS) and acetylated starch (AS) with different degrees of substitution (DS) were extruded with linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) at LLDPE/TPS-GT ratios of 70/30 and 60/40 prior to blown-film extrusion. Results indicated that a higher DS of AS enhanced melt flow index which altered processability and subsequently impacted film microstructures and physical and barrier properties. NS showed highest dispersed particles in film matrices with a lower reduction of mechanical and barrier properties. AS showed reduced surface hydrophobicity with increased water vapor permeability and film solubility due to pore formation. Increased DS of AS films showed enhanced radical scavenging activity (DPPH\n                        \n                      and FRAP) with improved phenolic release. GT release from the starch matrix effectively limited microbial growth, reduced metmyoglobin forming brown pigment, and stabilized the red color of bacon. Lipid oxidation of packaged soybean oil was effectively reduced by up to 38% depending on the TPS ratio which was attributed to hydrophobicity of the film matrices. Developed TPS-GT films showed high efficacy as active eco-friendlier food packaging, with enhanced stability of meat and oil-based food products."}{"Nanocomposite films with CMC, okra mucilage, and ZnO nanoparticles: Extending the shelf-life of chicken breast meat ": "Nanotechnology offers new possibilities to modify different aspects of biopolymer films in order to improve their performance in food packaging. The present study assessed the effect of nanocomposite films based on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), okra mucilage (OM), and ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) on the shelf-life of packed chicken breast meat stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Treatments examined in the present study were the following: CMC, CMC/ZnO, CMC/OM30%/ZnO, CMC/OM40%/ZnO, and CMC/OM50%/ZnO. Total viable counts (TVC), Staphylococcus aureus counts, Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) counts, thiobarbituric acid (TBA), total volatile nitrogen (TVN), instrumental color (CIE L*, a*, b*), and sensory attribute were determined at a gap of 3-day interval for a period of 12 days. Irrespective of the film type, an increasing trend for all microorganisms was observed over the storage time. However, the growth was significantly inhibited by okra mucilage and ZnO nanoparticles used in the packaging system (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The increase of lipid oxidation and TVN were significantly restricted by incorporation of okra mucilage and ZnO NPs. Chicken samples packed with okra mucilage and ZnO NPs produced higher lightness (L*) values (P\u2009<\u20090.05) as compared to the CMC samples. It was concluded that CMC/OM50%/ZnO film had the best inhibitory effect on the microbial growth and chemical changes in the chicken breast meat and the samples packed with it recorded higher sensorial score under chilling storage as well."}{"Biodegradable and transparent cellulose film prepared eco-friendly from durian rind for packaging application ": "High purity cellulose was isolated from durian rind in this study.

The PLA/PBAT blend film exhibited strong ultraviolet shielding properties at wavelengths below 300\u2009nm. The ZnONP incorporated composite films showed a characteristic absorption peak of ZnONP around 370\u2009nm. The surface morphology of the composite films was affected by the type of ZnONP, but the surface color, transparency, and chemical structure did not change after incorporation of ZnONP. The tensile strength of nanocomposite films increased significantly depending on the type of ZnONP used. The films reinforced with ZnONP exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes."}{"Color, vitamin C, \u03b2-carotene and sensory quality retention in microwave-assisted thermally sterilized sweet potato puree: Effects of polymeric package gas barrier during storage ": "In this study, we investigated the effects of package barrier properties on shelf-life of vitamin C-fortified sweet potato puree (SPP) processed with microwave-assisted thermal sterilization (MATS).

The total \u03b2-carotene content after processing and storage was slightly higher than before processing. Pouches with oxygen transmission rates (OTRs) of less than 0.3 cc/m2\u22c5day showed higher retention of color, vitamin C, and predicted shelf life than other pouches. However, this did not affect the consumer acceptance. Most panelists considered MATS processed SPP as a desirable baby food throughout the 18 months.

Cupriavidus necator was used in a two-stage production system. In the first stage, bacterial growth was favored and, in the second, PHA was synthesized. The use of 2% (v/v) vegetable oil, rich in saturated fatty acids, allowed a yield of 0.7\u2009g of PHA per g of peanut oil.

The bleaching rate of TPENOEt is tunable by longer wavelength light, white light irradiation and elevated temperature. The fluorescence of TPENOEt is weak in solid state, which increases obviously after grinding with a pestle accompanied by reduced photochromic efficiency and longer response time. These results provide a new view to get insight into the relationship between packing style and fluorescence/photochromism property of Schiff base derivatives. TPENOEt is successfully applied as a visible light driven rewritable paper, 410\u202fnm violet light can serve as a pen, while 420\u2013590\u202fnm visible light and white light is employed as the eraser. The recorded information will be erased in about 15\u202fs after white light irradiation and will be self-erased in 20\u202fmin in daylight and in about 15 days in dark. Moreover, TPENOEt can also serve as a UV strength sensor for naked eye detection of UV radiation pollution."}{"Effects of cavitation on different microorganisms: The current understanding of the mechanisms taking place behind the phenomenon. A review and proposals for further research ": "A sudden decrease in pressure triggers the formation of vapour and gas bubbles inside a liquid medium (also called cavitation). This leads to many (key) engineering problems: material loss, noise, and vibration of hydraulic machinery. On the other hand, cavitation is a potentially useful phenomenon: the extreme conditions are increasingly used for a wide variety of applications such as surface cleaning, enhanced chemistry, and wastewater treatment (bacteria eradication and virus inactivation).\n                  Despite this significant progress, a large gap persists between the understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the effects of cavitation and its application. Although engineers are already commercializing devices that employ cavitation, we are still not able to answer the fundamental question: What precisely are the mechanisms how bubbles can clean, disinfect, kill bacteria and enhance chemical activity?\n                  The present paper is a thorough review of the recent (from 2005 onward) work done in the fields of cavitation-assisted microorganism\u2019s destruction and aims to serve as a foundation to build on in the next years."}{"Ultrasonic liquid metal processing: The essential role of cavitation bubbles in controlling acoustic streaming ": "The acoustic streaming behaviour below an ultrasonic sonotrode in water was predicted by numerical simulation and validated by experimental studies. The flow was calculated by solving the transient Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations with a source term representing ultrasonic excitation implemented from the predictions of a nonlinear acoustic model. Comparisons with the measured flow field from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) water experiments revealed good agreement in both velocity magnitude and direction at two power settings, supporting the validity of the model for acoustic streaming in the presence of cavitating bubbles. Turbulent features measured by PIV were also recovered by the model. The model was then applied to the technologically important area of ultrasonic treatment of liquid aluminium, to achieve the prediction of acoustic streaming for the very first time that accounts for nonlinear pressure propagation in the presence of acoustic cavitation in the melt. Simulations show a strong dependence of the acoustic streaming flow direction on the cavitating bubble volume fraction, reflecting PIV observations. This has implications for the technological use of ultrasound in liquid metal processing."}{"Recent developments in the sonoelectrochemical synthesis of nanomaterials ": "In recent years, the synthesis and use of nanoparticles have been of special interest among the scientific communities due to their unique properties and applications in various advanced technologies. The production of these materials at industrial scale can be difficult to achieve due to high cost, intense labour and use of hazardous solvents that are often required by traditional chemical synthetic methods. Sonoelectrochemistry is a hybrid technique that combines ultrasound and electrochemistry in a specially designed electrochemical setup. This technique can be used to produce nanomaterials with controlled sizes and shapes. The production of nanoparticles by sonoelectrochemistry as a technique offers many advantages: (i) a great enhancement in mass transport near the electrode, thereby altering the rate, and sometimes the mechanism of the electrochemical reactions, (ii) a modification of surface morphology through cavitation jets at the electrode-electrolyte interface, usually causing an increase of the surface area and (iii) a thinning of the electrode diffusion layer thickness and therefore ion depletion. The scalability of sonoelectrochemistry for producing nanomaterials at industrial scale is also very plausible due to its \u201cone-pot\u201d synthetic approach. Recent advancements in sonoelectrochemistry for producing various types of nanomaterials are briefly reviewed in this article. It is with hope that the presentation of these studies therein can generate more interest in the field to \u201ccatalyze\u201d future investigations in novel nanomaterial development and industrial scale-up studies."}{"Recent advances in ultrasound application as a novel technique in analysis, processing and quality control of fruits, juices and dairy products industries: A review ": "Recently, ultrasound has been widely used in the researches in the food science and technology. Among the food materials, fruits, juices and dairy products are strongly sensitive to ultrasound-based techniques.

By studying the latest researches and advances in the field of ultrasound applications, it has been confirmed that this technique can be helpful in accelerating processes, reducing energy requirements, increasing productivity, and producing better quality food materials in the fields of fruits, juices and dairy products. Notwithstanding, in order to solve the challenges ahead, and for potential applications of ultrasound technology, further researches need to be expanded in the areas mentioned. Also, with the advancement of technology, more advanced equipment, ultrasound transducers and instrumentations would be introduced that needs to be applied in this regard, to solve the current challenges."}{"Review on the treatment of organic pollutants in water by ultrasonic technology ": "The application of ultrasonic technology in the treatment of organic pollutants in water has attracted more and more attention in recent years. Compared with conventional treatment, ultrasonic treatment is more efficient and time saving. Ultrasonic technology is effective for the degradation of many refractory organic pollutants. In this paper, the principle, influencing factors and various methods of ultrasonic degradation of organic pollutants are studied in view of ultrasonic treatment alone, ultrasound treatment methods combined with biocatalysts, chemical oxidation and adsorption techniques, respectively. In addition, the problems existing in the treatment of organic pollutants in water by ultrasonic technology are analyzed and the development direction is put forward."}{"A review on the applications of ultrasonic technology in membrane bioreactors ": "Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have received increasing attention in the field of wastewater treatment in recent years. However, membrane fouling is the main problem of MBRs, limiting their widespread and large applications. Membrane cleaning methods can be mainly classified into four types including chemical, physical, physico-chemical and biological clean the fouled membrane. In recent years, ultrasonication has been reported as a promising cleaning technique for the membranes fouled in MBRs. Ultrasonic irradiation can clean the fouled membrane by creating important physical phenomena including microjets, microstreams and shock waves. Moreover, the ultrasonic method can be combined with other cleaning methods e.g. chemical cleaning and backwashing in order to improve the cleaning efficiency. It should be noted that the application of ultrasonic in the MBR system is not limited to the cleaning of membrane. The pretreatment of the wastewater by ultrasonic irradiation or ultrasound coupled with other methods, e.g. ozonation, prior to MBR system, can decrease the organic loading of the wastewater and subsequently postpone the fouling of the membrane. This paper critically reviews the recent advances in the applications of ultrasound in MBR systems. Emerging issues associated with application of on-line ultrasound and also hybrid on-line ultrasound for controlling the membrane fouling in MBR systems are critically reviewed. Moreover, application of the ultrasound in ex-situ form for cleaning the fouled membranes and pretreatment of wastewater prior to the MBR system is discussed."}{"The application of unconventional technologies as pulsed electric field, ultrasound and microwave-vacuum drying in the production of dried cranberry snacks ": "A lot of effort is put to decrease the energy consumption of drying. This effect might be achieved by shift of a drying technology e.g. from a hot-air to a microwave-vacuum method. Moreover, an unconventional pre-treatment such as ultrasound or pulsed electric field may modify a cellular tissue, what influences drying kinetics of plant tissue. The aim of the study was to analyse the quality of microwave-vacuum dried, osmodehydrated (OD) cranberries processed by the means of blanching and ultrasound (US) or blanching followed by pulsed electric field and sonication (PEF\u202f+\u202fUS) in comparison to traditionally treated material. Physical, chemical and sensorial properties of cranberry fruits were assessed. What is more, the impact of aforementioned unconventional treatments on the kinetics of microwave-vacuum dried cranberries was studied. Microwave-vacuum drying process was very short (25\u201338\u202fmin) in comparison to convective drying, which lasted several hours (13.2\u202fh). Most of the samples subjected to US and PEF\u202f+\u202fUS treatments before OD and drying were characterized by similar or a higher amount of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, anthocyanins and flavonoids, and better colour and taste, as compared to cut osmodehydrated cranberry fruits subjected to convective drying (reference samples)."}{"Ultrasound-assisted heterogeneous Fenton-like process for bisphenol A removal at neutral pH using hierarchically structured manganese dioxide/biochar nanocomposites as catalysts ": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is an important emerging contaminant with endocrine-disrupting potential that has frequently been detected in aquatic environments. In this study, two types of hierarchically structured manganese dioxide/biochar nanocomposites (MnO2/BCs) were prepared for the first time via facile hydrothermal synthesis. The hydrothermal reaction was maintained at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 6\u202fh or 12\u202fh, after which an ultrasound-assisted heterogeneous Fenton-like process was used to catalyze the removal of BPA under neutral pH condition. The characterization results indicated that MnO2 nanoparticles were successfully formed on the nanocomposite surfaces and had flower-like (\u03b4-MnO2, 6\u202fh) and urchin-like (\u03b1-MnO2, 12\u202fh) morphology. This enabled a significant improvement in the catalytic activity of BPA removal by the reversible redox reaction. A series of experiments confirmed that the crystalline properties of the nanocomposites affected their catalytic activity. In particular, the \u03b1-MnO2/BCs exhibited catalytic activity in the ultrasound-assisted heterogeneous Fenton-like process and completely removed BPA within 20\u202fmin under the following conditions: [BPA]0\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcM; [H2O2]0\u202f=\u202f10\u202fmM; [catalyst]0\u202f=\u202f0.5\u202fg/L; ultrasound\u202f=\u202f20\u202fkHz (130\u202fW) at 40% amplitude; pH\u202f=\u202f7.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1; and temperature\u202f=\u202f25\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C. This efficiency may have been due to the synergistic effect of ultrasound and \u03b1-MnO2/BCs, which simultaneously induce the effective generation of reactive free radicals and increase the mass transfer rate at the solid-liquid interface. Overall, these results demonstrated that hierarchical urchin-like \u03b1-MnO2/BCs have significant potential as an efficient and low-cost catalyst in ultrasound-assisted heterogeneous Fenton-like systems."}{"Emergence and era of ultrasonic\u2019s in fruit juice preservation: A review ": "Ultrasonic\u2019s has emerged to an unconditional extent in the last decade. It has found its application in fruit juice and beverage industry due to its multifunctional desired effects. The technology is inexpensive, simple, reliable, and environmentally friendly and highly effective in the preservation of juices with enhanced quality attributes. This review will enlighten your knowledge in understanding the basic concept of ultrasonic\u2019s with the principle, mechanism, and application in the food sector. It specifically reviews the explored effect of ultrasonication on different juices. It explores the influence of technology in enzyme inactivation, microbial inactivation and different quality attributes of fruit juices. It gives you an in-depth insight into the technology."}{"Study on ultrasonic treatment for municipal sludge ": "Ultrasonic technique has attracted wide attention due to its advantages of no secondary pollution, high decomposition speed and simple equipment in the treatment of municipal sludge. In this paper, study on ultrasound-chemical treatment for municipal sludge in investigated. Results indicate that ultrasonic waves can destroy sludge floc structure and cell walls, release intracellular organic matter, and accelerate the hydrolysis process; ultrasonic can improve the sedimentation and dewatering performance of sludge; ultrasonic wave can produce a sponge effect on sludge, which makes the water flow through the channel more easily from the wave surface, thereby agglomerating the sludge particles and increasing the particle size; ultrasound can promote coagulation; ultrasound can also improve the activity of excess sludge, and improve the efficiency of anaerobic digestion process and the final biogas production. Ultrasound-Cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) treatment can undermine the repulsion between particles to a certain extent and destabilizes sludge flocs. In addition, the adsorption and bridging action of the flocculant CPAM further agglomerates the sludge particles, and the water in the sludge is squeezed out to be converted into free water, which further improves the dewatering performance of the sludge, thereby reducing the moisture content of the filter cake."}{"High-intensity ultrasound: A novel technology for the development of probiotic and prebiotic dairy products ": "High-intensity ultrasound (HIUS) can be used as a mild-preservation technology in dairy products, due to its ability to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms and enzymes. In addition, it can result in physical and chemical alterations in the products and has impact on the probiotic viability and metabolic activity. This review provides an overview of the effects of HIUS on dairy products manufactured with probiotics and prebiotics. Furthermore, it presents perspectives of HIUS application on paraprobiotics and postbiotics products. HIUS has been proven to be a potential technology and its application to fermented dairy products can result in shorter processing time, increased probiotic viability, and products with low lactose content, higher oligosaccharides concentration, less undesirable taste (lower propionic and acetic acids content) and reduced ingredients (no need of prebiotic addition or \u03b2-galactosidase inclusion). In cheeses, HIUS can reduce the ripening time and accelerate proteolysis, resulting in products with better sensory, textural and nutritional (bioactive peptides) characteristics. Furthermore, it can change the prebiotic structure, facilitating the access for the probiotics. The impact of the HIUS is highly dependent on the process parameters (frequency, power, processing time, pulse mode and duration), type of probiotic culture and food composition. Therefore, HIUS process parameters must be precisely quantified and controlled. The HIUS can also be applied to the inactivation of probiotic cultures and development of paraprobiotic products or to the improvement in the production of soluble factors (postbiotics) with health effects. Further researches should be conducted to evaluate the efficiency of this methodology in the cases of paraprobiotic and postbiotic products."}{"Effects of different ionic strengths on the physicochemical properties of plant and animal proteins-stabilized emulsions fabricated using ultrasound emulsification ": "In this study, high intensity ultrasound (HIU) was used to produce food protein stabilized emulsions under different ionic strengths (0, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 300\u202fmM NaCl). Five plant and animal food proteins, whey protein isolate (WPI), soy protein isolate (SPI), bovine gelatin, peanut protein isolate (PPI) and corn zein were selected as protein emulsifiers. PPI and zein could not form emulsions using ultrasound emulsification at all ionic strengths (from 0 to 300\u202fmM NaCl). However, ultrasound could induce stable emulsions using SPI, WPI and gelatin as emulsifiers. Moreover, different ionic strengths and protein types influenced the physicochemical properties of HIU induced emulsions obviously. It was found that the droplet sizes of gelatin emulsions were lower than those of SPI and WPI emulsions at salt concentrations of 300\u202fmM NaCl. Furthermore, gelatin emulsions had better stability against environmental stresses (salt and temperature) than that of SPI and WPI emulsions. Moreover, the adsorbed protein (%) at the oil/water interface of SPI emulsions was higher than those of WPI and gelatin emulsions. However, the adsorbed protein amount of all proteins stabilized emulsions increased significantly after salt addition. The absolute \u03b6-potential values decreased with the increase of salt concentrations. The microrheology results indicated that the SPI emulsions formed a gel-like structure at high salt concentrations (>50\u202fmM NaCl) as SPI emulsions exhibited higher elasticity than WPI and gelatin emulsions. In conclusion, the ultrasound as a green emulsification technique could be used to fabricate emulsions stabilized by plant and animal proteins."}{"Influence of ultrasound and osmotic dehydration pretreatments on drying and quality properties of persimmon fruit ": "In this study, the effect of the ultrasound and osmotic dehydration pretreatments before the convective drying of the persimmon fruit was assessed via their drying behavior and quality properties. Ultrasound-assisted osmotic dehydration (30\u202f\u00b0C, 45\u202f\u00b0Brix) was performed at 35\u202fkHz for 10, 20, and 30\u202fmin. Afterward, samples were placed first in 45 then in 70\u202f\u00b0Brix sucrose solutions; the solutions were next shaken at 100\u202frpm. The control group without ultrasound treatment dehydrated osmotically. The samples were dried in a tray drier at a temperature of 60\u202f\u00b0C and an air velocity of 1.5\u202fm/s. Ultrasound-assisted osmotic drying treatments increased water loss and sugar gain; moreover, the osmotic dehydration time was shorter than in the untreated group. The ultrasound-assisted osmotic dehydration demonstrated a significantly decreased drying time, increased drying rates, and a 21% increase in effective water diffusivity by 30\u202fmin. The ultrasound pretreated osmotic dehydration prior to hot air-drying decreased the total required drying time. The ultrasound-assisted osmotic dehydration affected the rehydration rate and total phenolic content significantly and there was no significant difference between the color change (\u0394E, \u0394C, and Hue\u00b0) of the ultrasound treatment (30\u202fmin) group and the untreated group."}{"Numerical modelling of acoustic streaming during the ultrasonic melt treatment of direct-chill (DC) casting ": "Acoustic streaming and its attendant effects in the sump of a direct-chill (DC) casting process are successfully predicted under ultrasonic treatment for the first time. The proposed numerical model couples acoustic cavitation, fluid flow, heat and species transfer, and solidification to predict the flow pattern, acoustic pressure, and temperature fields in the sump. The model is numerically stable with time steps of the order of 0.01\u202fs and therefore computationally attractive for optimization studies necessitating simulation times of the order of a minute. The sump profile is altered by acoustic streaming, with the slurry region depressed along the centreline of the billet by a strong central jet. The temperature gradient in the transition zone is increased, potentially interfering with grain refinement. The cooling rate in the sump is also altered, thereby modifying the dendrite arm spacing of the as-cast billet. The relative position of the sonotrode affects the sump profile, with the sump depth decreased by around 5\u202fmm when the sonotrode is moved above the graphite ring level by 100\u202fmm. The acoustic streaming jet penetrates into the slurry zone and, as a result, the growth direction of dendritic grains in the off-centre position is altered."}{"Exploring the profitability of improved storage technologies and their potential impacts on food security and income of smallholder farm households in Tanzania ": "This study assesses the profitability of selected improved grain storage technologies and the potential impact of their adoption on food security and income of smallholder maize producers in Tanzania. We used on-farm experiment data, time series maize price data, and household survey data to address the objectives. For the improved technologies, we considered Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags, metallic silos of different sizes, and polypropylene (PP) bags treated with Actellic Super\u00ae. We compared them with PP bags without insecticide treatment as the control. Results show that PICS bags and PP bags plus Actellic Super are profitable in all locations and not significantly different. While the feasible period varies by location, profit is most likely negative if farmers sell their maize in the first two months after harvest and in the last two months before the next harvest. There are mixed results with regards to the profitability of metallic silos; bigger silos are profitable for farmers who have economies of scale to use them while smaller ones are profitable only within the context of higher grain price and bigger seasonal price gap. The results also show that PICS bags (or PP bags plus Actellic Super) are useful to address food security and income objectives among poor rural households whereas metallic silos with bigger storage capacity can increase the income of those farmers who have bigger surplus grain to sale."}{"Effectiveness of the solar biomass hybrid dryer for drying and disinfestation of maize ": "The Solar Biomass Hybrid Dryer (SBHD) is a new technology developed in Ghana for grain drying and utilizes biomass (agro-residues, timber scraps, etc.) along with solar drying, and is especially useful for drying during rainy periods of the year when solar drying cannot be relied on. This study assessed the effectiveness of a 5.0-MT SBHD comprising a solar tent and a furnace for thermal drying and disinfestation of maize. Mortalities of adults of Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and Cryptolestes ferrugineus Stephens were assessed. Additionally, mortalities of immatures of these three species were assessed. Internal and cage temperatures (\u00b0C) in the SBHD, sun drying (SD) and laboratory (control) were monitored, as were moisture content (MC) and thermally (stress) damaged kernels (TDK) (%). During the 7-h experiment, mean internal temperatures in the SBHD, SD and laboratory were 52.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202f\u00b0C, 41.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8\u202f\u00b0C and 30.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. Similarly, temperatures in cages in the SBHD (49.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202f\u00b0C) were higher than those for cages in the laboratory (29.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202f\u00b0C) and SD (38.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.6\u202f\u00b0C). Reduction in the moisture content of maize dried using SBHD, SD and under laboratory conditions were 7.7, 5.2 and 2.9%, respectively. This corresponded to grain MC reduction rates of 1.1%, 0.74% and 0.4% per hour. There was 100% mortality of S. zeamais and C.\u00a0ferrugineus adults achieved in only the SBHD; some immatures of all three species survived in all three treatments. However, survival of immatures was highest in the laboratory, followed by SD and lowest in the SBHD for all three species. Percent TDK was higher in the SBHD (6.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.9) than SD (3.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3) and laboratory (2.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3). These data show that the SBHD is effective for both drying and disinfestation of grain."}{"Response of Aspergillus flavus spores to nitric oxide fumigations in atmospheres with different oxygen concentrations ": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a newly discovered fumigant for postharvest pest control. NO fumigation must be conducted under ultralow oxygen conditions because NO reacts with O2 to produce nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In this study, NO fumigations under different O2 concentrations were conducted on Aspergillus flavus spores to determine effectiveness of NO and NO2 in inactivating spores. Spores on gridded cellulose filter discs in Petri dishes were subjected to six fumigation treatments including a control with varying levels of NO under different O2 conditions for 3\u202fh\u202fat 15\u202f\u00b0C. The discs with spores were then cultured on Aspergillus Differentiation medium plates after fumigation for four days at 25\u202f\u00b0C to count A.\u00a0flavus colonies. Untreated control discs each had over 50 A.\u00a0flavus colonies. Three fumigation treatments with 0.1% NO2 or 1.0% NO caused complete inactivation of A.\u00a0flavus spores. The study demonstrated that NO fumigation with certain levels of NO2 can effectively inactivate A.\u00a0flavus spores. The results suggest that NO fumigation has potential to be an alternative treatment to control both pests and microbes on stored products."}{"Degradation of gluten proteins by Fusarium species and their impact on the grain quality of bread wheat ": "The protein quality of wheat, the most important crop worldwide, is affected by the presence of fungi, mainly those belonging to the Fusarium genus. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of Fusarium spp. on ground wheat grains quality by measuring gluten strength and quantifying the gliadin/glutenin content. A total of 23 Fusarium spp. isolates and two bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes with contrasting baking quality were used in the investigation. The results of SDS sedimentation test (SDSS) revealed that the presence of Fusarium species significantly affected the gluten strength negatively; while F.\u00a0pseudograminearum and F.\u00a0graminearum are the species that predominantly affected the SDSS values. Principal component analysis of gluten composition showed that the effect of Fusarium species on gluten composition depended on the wheat genotypes analyzed. Cluster analysis revealed that all the Fusarium species used as inoculum produced severe effects on grain quality and gluten composition on both the genotypes. In summary, our results showed that the presence of Fusarium spp. impaired storage proteins affecting the wheat dough properties. Therefore, constant monitoring is necessary to reduce the presence of Fusarium in the food chain for reducing the negative potential impact on bread quality."}{"Effects of PICS bags on insect pests of sorghum during long-term storage in Burkina Faso ": "The PICS bags, originally developed for cowpea storage, were evaluated for sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) preservation. Batches of 25\u202fkg of sorghum grain were stored in 50\u202fkg PICS or polypropylene (PP) bags under ambient conditions for 12 months and assessed for the presence of insect pests and their damage, seed viability and, oxygen and carbon dioxide variations. The grain was incubated for 35 days to assess whether any insects would emerge. After six months of storage, oxygen levels decreased in the PICS bags compared to polypropylene bags. After 12 months of storage, only two pests, Rhyzopertha dominica and Sitophilus zeamais were found in the PICS bags. However, in PP bags there were additional pests including Tribolium castaneum and Oryzeaphilus mercator and Xylocoris flavipes. Grain weight loss and damage caused by these insects in the PP bags were significantly higher compared to those stored in PICS bags. Germination rates of sorghum grains stored in PP bags decreased significantly while no changes were observed in grains stored in PICS bags when compared to the initial germination. After the incubation post storage period, there was a resurgence of R. dominica in sorghum grains from PICS bags but the population levels were significantly lower compared to polypropylene bags. PICS bags preserved the quality and viability of stored sorghum grains and protected it from key insect pests. The PICS technology is effective for long-term sorghum storage but the potential resurgence of insects in low-oxygen environment calls for further research."}{"Kinetics of the ozone gas reaction in popcorn kernels ": "The objectives of this work were to determine the saturation times for popcorn kernels exposed to different concentrations of ozone gas (O3) in a constant flow; to study the kinetics of the ozone gas decomposition in the grain mass; and to ascertain the ozone treatment effect on grain quality. In order to promote saturation and to study the decomposition reaction kinetics, samples of popcorn kernels were exposed to ozone gas or atmospheric air (control) at a specific flow rate of 0.33\u202fm3\u202fmin\u22121 t\u22121, and concentrations of 500, 2200, and 4500\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121. The popping expansion volume, water content and electrical conductivity of the ozonized popcorn kernel samples were considered to investigate the effect of ozone treatment on popcorn quality. The effect of ozone treatment on insect mortality was also evaluated. The grain masses treated at ozone concentrations of 500, 2200, and 4500\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 reached the saturation condition after 10, 3.1, and 2.1\u202fh, respectively. At all concentrations considered, the decomposition kinetics of the ozone gas when in contact with the saturated grain mass was best explained by a first-order model. The decomposition rate constants were equal to 0.13, 0.11, and 0.12 min\u22121, for the concentrations of 500, 2200, and 4500\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121, respectively. At these ozone levels, the quality analyses of the popcorn grains did not reveal alterations that could compromise the product commercially. Nevertheless, the concentrations of 500, 2200, and 4500\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 proved to be lethal to the insects at the exposure times corresponding to the saturation in each case."}{"Detection of phosphine resistance in major stored-product insects in Greece and evaluation of a field resistance test kit ": "The use of phosphine has been effective against a wide range of stored-product pests in different types of commodities and facilities. However, its continuous and improper use has led to resistance development in -several major insect species. Although phosphine resistance has been reported from many countries across the globe, reports from Europe have been very limited. In the present study, we determined phosphine resistance in insect populations that had been collected from a range of storages across Greece, using two different diagnostic protocols. Apart from the traditional Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) protocol, a field test kit (known as the Detia Degesch Tolerance Test Kit, DDTTPK) was utilized, for \u201csame day\u201d determination of the resistance status of field collected insects. In total, 53 populations belonging to Rhyzopertha dominica, Sitophilus oryzae, Sitophilus granarius, Cryptolestes ferrugineus, Tribolium confusum, Tribolium castaneum and Oryzaephilus surinamensis were tested. For the majority of the species and populations tested, both FAO and DDPTTK provided similar results, for the susceptibility to phosphine and thus, the quick test could be used with success for an initial same day screening of phosphine resistance. Among the tested species, the populations recorded with the most frequent survival at the FAO testing dose of phosphine was that of R.\u00a0dominica. The dissimilar evaluation and characterization of resistance to phosphine between diagnostic protocols is particularly important, as it poses risks in the over or underestimation of the resistance status of a given population. Our data indicate that the DDPTTK could be used to determine resistance to phosphine in the field, before the initiation of fumigations to disinfest stored commodities."}{"Safe storage times of FINOLA\u00ae hemp (Cannabis sativa) seeds with dockage ": "Safe storage times of hemp seeds (cultivar: FINOLA\u00ae) were studied by storing the hemp seeds with three dockage levels (0, 5, and 15%) at four temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35\n                        \n                           \u00b0C\n                        \n                     ), four relative humidities (50, 63, 75, and 92%) for up to 26\u202fwk. To evaluate the safe storage time, the following storage parameters were measured or determined: seed germination, free fatty acid value (FAV) of seeds, and visible and invisible mold. Dockage percentages did not significantly influence equilibrium moisture content, FAV, germination loss and the time of the first appearance of visible and invisible mold and number of kernels infected by storage fungi. This non-influence was caused by the experimental setup because the heat and water produced by the spoiled hemp seeds with dockage were diffused out of the 1\u202fkg sample. Hemp seeds with 15% dockage had slightly faster germination loss than that with lower percentages of dockage. The FAV of hemp seeds had a negative correlation with germination. Based on the time for 20% initial germination losses, the safe storage guidelines of stored bulks of hemp seeds were developed and mathematically modelled. The recommended safe storage moisture content was 8% under Canadian conditions. At 25\u202f\u00b0C, the safe storage time was 20.8 and 2.8\u202fwk if the hemp seeds without dockage had 8% and 14% moisture contents, respectively."}{"Historical review of computer simulation of radiation effects in materials ": "In this Article, I review the development of computer simulation techniques for studying radiation effects in materials from 1946 until 2018. These developments were often closely intertwined with associated experimental developments, which are also briefly discussed in conjunction with the simulations. The focus is on methods that either deal directly with the primary radiation damage generation event, or with such defects or phase changes that typically occur due to radiation. The methods discussed at some length are, in order of historical appearance: Reaction rate theory or rate equations (RE), Monte Carlo neutronics calculations (MCN), Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC), Molecular Dynamics (MD), Binary Collision Approximation (BCA), Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC), Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD), Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), and Finite Element Modelling (FEM). For each method, I present the origins of the methods, some key developments after this, as well as give some opinions on possible future development paths."}{"Ferritic-martensitic steels for fission and fusion applications ": "Compared to austenitic stainless steels, largely employed in the early fission reactors, high chromium Ferritic/Martenstic (FM) steels, developed since the first half of the 20th century for fossil-fuel power-plants, have a number of advantageous properties among which lower thermal expansion, higher thermal conductivity and better void swelling resistance. At the beginning of the 1970s, FM steels found their first nuclear application as wrapper and fuel cladding materials in sodium-cooled fast reactors. They are now the reference materials for in-vessel components of future fusion reactors, and are considered for in-pile and out-of-pile applications in Generation IV reactors as well as for various other nuclear systems. In this paper, after an introductory historical overview, the challenges associated with the use of FM steels in advanced reactors are addressed, including fabrication, joining and codification issues. The long term evolution of mechanical properties such as the creep and creep-fatigue behaviors is discussed and the degradation phenomena occurring in aggressive environments (lead alloys, high temperature gases, super-critical water and CO2, molten salts) are detailed. The paper also provides a brief overview of the radiation effects in FM steels. The influence of the key radiation parameters e.g. temperature, dose and dose rate on the microstructure and mechanical properties are discussed. The need to better understand the synergistic effects of displacement damage and helium produced by transmutation in fusion conditions is highlighted."}{"Hydrogen in zirconium alloys: A review ": "Hydrogen absorbed into zirconium alloy nuclear fuel cladding as a result of the waterside corrosion reaction can affect the properties of nuclear fuel, principally through the precipitation of brittle hydride particles. Multiple phenomena are involved in this overall process: after hydrogen pickup degradation of mechanical properties is controlled by hydrogen transport, hydride precipitation and dissolution kinetics and the formation of specific mesoscale hydride microstructures. The precipitation of hydrides especially affects cladding ductility and fracture toughness, but can also affect other phenomena, including via stress-induced hydride reorientation. These processes can affect cladding performance both during normal operation and during extended dry storage, as hydride morphology can be modified during the preparatory vacuum drying processes. We review the processes of hydrogen transport, hydride precipitation and dissolution and formation of mesoscale hydride microstructures, and highlight where more research is needed, both from an experimental and from a modeling point of view."}{"Predicting the onset of void swelling in irradiated metals with machine learning ": "Radiation-induced void swelling is a serious mode of degradation in nuclear structural materials. Much effort has been spent to predict swelling resistance, with the goal of increasing the void swelling incubation dose so as to postpone the consequences of radiation damage. However, this trial-and-error approach is highly inefficient due to the time- and resource-intensive nature of both experiments and physics-based multiscale simulations. In this work, as a first attempt, machine learning is applied to perform this prediction based on available experimental data. Of the multiple techniques applied, the gradient boosting ensemble method best predicts experimental onset doses for swelling in test datasets, and identifies the main contributing factors such as temperature, Fe and Cr content, and dose rate, which are consistent with established understanding. This work demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning to predict macroscale radiation effects based on material and environmental parameters, and has practical significance in guiding further material optimization for nuclear applications."}{"Irradiation creep and growth of zirconium alloys: A critical review ": "The fuel channels and fuel assemblies of all conventional nuclear reactors that generate power from the fission of uranium by thermal neutrons are made from zirconium alloys because of their low thermal neutron absorption cross-section. The dimensional stability, and the ability to predict dimensional changes, of components made from zirconium alloys is important to designers and operators of such reactors because deformation has a consequence for the operability or life of the reactor core. The dimensional changes in zirconium alloys due to neutron irradiation has been the subject of intense study since the inception of the thermal nuclear power reactor. During irradiation zirconium alloys behave differently from most other engineering alloys in that they resist swelling. They do exhibit anisotropic dimensional changes in the absence of an applied stress that depend on the microstructure; this process is called irradiation growth. Like any other material they also exhibit a dimensional response to an applied stress; this process is called irradiation creep. In this review the evolution in measurement methodologies (either from controlled experiments in materials test reactors or gauging of power reactor components) is described together with the results gleaned from such measurements. As measurements have improved and the amount of experimental and operational data has increased, the theoretical basis for modelling creep and growth has also evolved. The history of the evolution in understanding and the ability to predict dimensional changes in zirconium alloys over the past 60\u201370 years is described and discussed."}{"General corrosion and stress corrosion cracking of Alloy 600 in light water reactor primary coolants ": "The general corrosion and stress corrosion cracking behaviors of the nickel-base Alloy 600 in the primary high temperature aqueous coolants of light water cooled and moderated nuclear power reactors are reviewed. The compatible welding Alloys 182 and 82 as well as the high strength, precipitation hardened analogue, Alloy X-750, are also included. The emphasis is on what is known of the underlying science of these degradation phenomena rather than on the associated engineering consequences and remedies."}{"Enthalpies of formation and phase stability relations of USi, U3Si5 and U3Si2\n             ": "U\u2013Si intermetallic compounds have drawn great attention due to their potential application as nuclear fuels. However, the thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria of this binary system from ambient to high temperature conditions are not fully understood. Via high temperature oxidative drop calorimetry and detailed characterization of the initial and final phases, we have experimentally determined the standard enthalpies of formation of USi and U3Si5.07 at 298\u202fK to be\u00a0\u221243.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.2 and\u00a0\u221243.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.0\u202fkJ/mol\u00b7atom, respectively. The energetics of the tetragonal USi (t-USi, space group I4/mmm) phase has also been calculated with Density Functional Theory (DFT) for the first time. Combining the obtained formation enthalpies with the heat capacities measured previously, we assessed the thermodynamic stability of t-USi relative to a phase assemblage of two other U\u2013Si phases, U3Si5.07 and U3Si2, from ambient temperature to 1200\u202fK. The tetragonal USi is thermodynamically more stable than U3Si5.07\u00a0+\u00a0U3Si2, which supports previously published phase diagram (H. Okamoto and T. Massalski, 1990 [1]): specifically, at least one stable USi phase exists when the U content is 50\u202fat.%. Further thermodynamic and phase equilibrium studies are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the U\u2013Si system across broader compositional and temperature ranges."}{"Influence of solidification structures on radiation-induced swelling in an additively-manufactured austenitic stainless steel ": "Metal additive manufacturing offers potential advantages for producing structural materials, such as austenitic stainless steels, in nuclear power systems. However, the microstructure developed during metal additive processing is notably different from the one developed in conventional processing, and the influence of the microstructural differences on performance in radiation environments has not been fully quantified. Using heavy ion irradiation and transmission electron microscopy, the radiation-induced swelling response of a laser powder-bed fusion-manufactured austenitic stainless steel was investigated at high doses. The influence of solidification-induced dislocation and precipitate structures was studied by comparing the radiation-induced swelling response of a 316\u202fL stainless steel in three microstructural states: as-fabricated, solution annealed, and fully recrystallized. Void swelling was approximately twice as pronounced in the as-fabricated state compared to post-processed states. In the framework of the rate theory for radiation effects, the higher swelling in the as-fabricated state can be explained by the strong sink bias for interstitial point defects exerted by the intermediate density of pre-existing dislocations. Void swelling was inhibited in the vicinity of pre-existing precipitates, but the density of precipitates in the as-fabricated material was not enough to compensate for the increase in swelling caused by dislocations."}{"Strain localization in copper canister FSW welds for spent nuclear fuel disposal ": "Spent nuclear fuel disposal in copper canisters in a deep geologic repository is planned in Finland and Sweden. The purpose of the copper shell is to perform as a ductile corrosion barrier to prevent radioactive substances from leaking into the environment. Therefore, the most important property of the copper shell, besides the good corrosion resistance, is its ductility. The copper canisters are sealed by friction stir welding (FSW), which results in strong welds when compared to the base materials, but the microstructural heterogeneity introduced by the welding may also lead to strain localization. Thus, the strain localization behavior of two different copper canister welds was studied by tensile tests in combination with digital image correlation (DIC). The main difference between the welds is the utilization of shielding gas to reduce oxidation during welding. The shielding gas improves the stability of the welding process, as well as reduces the number of oxide particles in the welds. It is known, that oxide particles are detrimental in copper in the presence of hydrogen. Therefore, the two welds were also thermally hydrogen charged to study hydrogen trapping in the weld material. Thermal desorption measurements (TDS) show that considerable hydrogen uptake occurs in the weld oxide zone, but it did not compromise the ductility of the copper welds in these tests. However, the DIC tests indicate considerably earlier strain localization on the retreating side of the new weld, welded with the shielding gas. This is attributed to differences in the initial state of the lid materials."}{"Early studies on Cr-Coated Zircaloy-4 as enhanced accident tolerant nuclear fuel claddings for light water reactors ": "Coatings with thicknesses between a few microns and \u223c10\u202f\u202f\u03bcm deposited on a Zircaloy-4 substrate have been studied with the objective to provide a significant reduction in the oxidation-induced embrittlement of the nuclear fuel cladding, especially in accidental conditions, such as LOss-of-Coolant-Accident (LOCA) conditions. This paper deals with the early studies carried out at CEA, several years before the Fukushima-Daiishi events, on different types of coatings obtained by a physical vapor deposition process. The studied coatings included ceramic, nitride and metallic multi-layered ones. The results of this screening analysis showed that the first generation of chromium-based coatings exhibited the most promising behavior: good compromise between oxidation resistance and adhesion to the metallic substrate, good fretting resistance and improved resistance to oxidation in steam at high temperature (Design Basis Accident LOCA conditions and slightly beyond)."}{"Behavior of tungsten under irradiation and plasma interaction ": ""}{"Irradiation effects of medium-entropy alloy NiCoCr with and without pre-indentation ": "Medium entropy alloy NiCoCr draws great attention due to its excellent strength-ductility trade-off mechanical behavior. Its irradiation behavior at elevated temperatures has been investigated using ion beam irradiation in a temperature range of 420\u2013580\u00b0Cand transmission electron microscopy. Irradiation induced stacking fault tetrahedra were only observed at 420\u202f\u00b0C. With increasing irradiation temperature, all stacking fault tetrahedra vanished, while the size of voids and dislocation loops increased significantly. Nanoindentation-induced structural complexities, including dislocations, stacking faults and twins helped to reduce void swelling. However, at the elevated temperatures, NiCoCr is still much more susceptible to void swelling compared to high entropy alloys such as NiCoFeCrMn and NiCoFeCrPd."}{"High temperature oxidation and microstructural evolution of cold spray chromium coatings on Zircaloy-4 in steam environments ": "Oxidation kinetics and microstructural evolution of cold sprayed Cr coatings on Zircaloy-4 at 1130\u20131310\u202f\u00b0C in flowing steam at atmospheric pressure have been studied. The study is aimed at understanding of the response of Cr coated Zr-alloy under a steam environment and high temperatures pertinent to design basis accidents (DBAs) and beyond design basis accidents (BDBAs) in light water reactors (LWRs). Surface morphology, microstructure, and phases of post-oxidation test samples were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). Growth kinetics of the Cr-oxide scale and interdiffusion layers between the Cr coating and the Zr-alloy substrate were quantified from cross-sectional SEM images. Cross-sectional analysis showed that the Cr coatings offered a 50 times reduction in oxidation rate over bare Zircaloy-4 in a 1310\u202f\u00b0C steam environment. Oxidation kinetics at 1130\u202f\u00b0C followed parabolic law (i.e., n\u202f\u223c\u202f0.5 in power law kinetics) but at 1230\u202f\u00b0C and 1310\u202f\u00b0C the value of n was suppressed to below 0.5 possibly due to the volatilization of Cr species at the two highest temperatures. Interdiffusion at coating/substrate interface resulted in formation of a brittle Cr2Zr or Zr(Fe, Cr)2 intermetallic compound layer on the order of micrometer in thickness and scattered Cr-rich precipitates were observed well below the interface within the Zr-alloy substrate after cooling. These experimental results could provide data to LWR system simulation codes for better estimation of coping time in the event of accidents."}{"Geological and geophysical signatures of the East Pacific Rise 8\u00b0\u201310\u00b0N ": "The East Pacific Rise (EPR) 8\u00b0\u201310\u00b0N is an archetype for fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge (MOR), and has been one of the most comprehensively studied MOR sections for over four decades. It covers all orders of ridge discontinuities: first-order transform faults, second-order overlapping spreading centers, third-order small offset tectonic discontinuities, and fourth-order discontinuities of eruptive fissure zones. This section has been selected as a multi-disciplinary integrated study site because of its abundance of hydrothermal vents where scientists are investigating the linkages between mantle flow, crustal accretion, volcanic, hydrothermal, and biological processes that result in chemical and physical exchanges of energy and matter between the Earth's mantle and oceans. In particular, the segment near 9\u00b050\u2032N is one of the only two sites where repeated seafloor volcanic eruptions were onsite observed along the MOR. In this paper, we investigate the geological and geophysical signatures of the EPR 8\u00b0\u201310\u00b0N on behalf of the fast-spreading MOR, present the seismic signatures of the hydrothermal pathways through full waveform inversion, and put forward some thoughts on the remaining questions to be addressed. The skewness of mantle upwelling, on- and off-axis magmatism, are playing a critical role in shaping the crustal architecture. The spatial distribution and physical property of the crustal melt lens are mutually related to the hydrothermal system. The mechanism of hydrosphere-lithosphere interaction beneath the MOR is worth further studying. This compilation should be useful to investigators new to the MOR topic but we also target advanced researchers in presentation and synthesis of findings to date."}{"Trace element partitioning between MgAl2O4-spinel and carbonatitic silicate melt from 3 to 6\u00a0GPa, with emphasis on the role of cation order-disorder ": "To better understand the partitioning of trace elements between spinels and silicate melts at high P, a series of experiments have been conducted in the system CaO\u2013MgO\u2013Al2O3\u2013SiO2\u2013K2O\u2013CO2 at the P-T conditions of 3\u20136\u00a0GPa and 1500\u20131650\u00a0\u00b0C. These experiments successfully produced large MgAl2O4-spinel crystals coexisting with large carbonatitic silicate melt pools (plus large crystals of olivine and garnet in some cases). The experimental products were analyzed by using an electron microprobe in the wavelength-dispersive mode and an Agilent 7500 Ce laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which led to high-P partition coefficients for 34 elements. The results suggest that pressure may have nominal significant impacts on the partition coefficients of some trace elements such as Nb, Ta, Ti, and nearly all rare earth elements (REEs), with the partition coefficients varying in several orders of magnitudes, but may play negligible roles in the partitioning of U, Mn, Fe, Sr, Ba, Na, K, Rb, and etc. Further analyses have revealed that much of the nominal P effects can be assigned to the Mg\u2013Al cation order-disorder reaction. Cation exchange reactions are common in many geologically important minerals such as olivine, garnet, pyroxene, and plagioclase, and their effects on trace element partitioning should be extensively investigated in the near future before better understanding of the trace element partitioning systematics can be achieved. As one example, our experimental results have clearly demonstrated that due to much larger degrees of the Mg\u2013Al cation order-disorder triggered by high P, spinel can strongly fractionate the REEs (with some heavy REEs compatible in the spinels and thus depleted in the relevant magmas), a phenomenon conventionally attributed to the presence of garnet. Some other important conclusions from our experiments include that Cr (or Ni) in the spinel structure at Cr-poor (or Ni-poor) conditions may be not as compatible as conventionally thought for Cr-rich (or Ni-rich) conditions, and Fe isotopes may be fractionated by spinels at high P."}{"A parametric heat flow model in the spherical earth ": "In this paper, we model the temperature profile of the Earth with two heat sources: the first is the interior source, generally understood by geophysicists as the primary, if not only, source; the second is a source closer to the surface, explained herein. The model temperature profiles with our chosen best-fit parameters are compared with data from the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) to examine the relative sizes of the two sources; the near-surface source is found to be much larger than the interior source. If correct, the near-surface source could explain a number of paradoxes involving the heat coming from the Earth that have until now not been resolved."}{"New progress on the onshore-offshore seismic survey in East China Continental Margin ": "The East China Continental Margin (ECCM) is an exemplified natural laboratory not only for studying the origin and evolution of trench-arc-basin system, but also for investigating the deformation mechanism within continent and its margins. For a better understanding on the structure and evolution of the ECCM, a NW\u2013SE trending onshore-offshore seismic profile was recently carried out there using controlled source wide-angle and passive broadband seismic experiments in combination. This 1050-km-long seismic profile transects the East China Sea Continental Shelf Basin (CSB), Zhemin Volcanic Belt, Lower Yangtze Block, and southern North China Craton from East China Sea to continental East China. Preliminary results, such as crustal reflected and refracted phases and P-wave receiver functions, show a good quality of the seismic data and tentatively delineate some first-order characteristics of the crustal structure of the ECCM. Expectably, more detailed crustal seismic velocity and geometric structures along the profile can be constructed by a further processing of the seismic data, and enable continuous and detailed comparisons of the crustal structure and inherent nature among different blocks, combined with other existing seismic profiles in the study region. And these further studies will provide reliable constraints on some controversial geologic issues, such as the origin of CSB, the contacting boundaries and collisional processes among Cathaysian Block, Yangtze and North China cratons."}{"Estimating sedimentary pile thickness, structural lineaments and heat flow in parts of North Central Nigeria from aeromagnetic data ": "Evaluation, analysis and interpretation of aeromagnetic data acquired over parts of North Central Nigeria were carried out in order to characterise structural features and lineaments, sedimentary pile thickness, geothermal gradient and heat flow in the study area. Fourier domain digital filtering and reduction to pole (RTP) operations were done to enhance the data, while spectral analysis and source parameter imaging (SPI) were used to analyse the data. Results from the 2-D spectral analysis of the enhanced magnetic data suggest that the depth range to the top of magnetic sources Zt is 0.33\u20130.73\u00a0km (average depth of 0.55\u00a0km); depth range to magnetic centroid Zo is 2.51\u20135.83\u00a0km (average depth of 3.94\u00a0km); Curie point depth range is 4.41\u201310.96\u00a0km (average depth of 7.32\u00a0km); and average sedimentary rock cover thickness is 3.94\u00a0km. This compares with the results from SPI which gave depth ranges to various magnetic sources as 0.27\u20133.01\u00a0km. Structural lineament analysis indicates the major trend of the structural lineament is in the NE\u2013SW, NW\u2013SE and NNE-SSW. Average geothermal gradient of 82.87\u00b0Ckm\u22121 and heat flow of 207.19\u00a0mWm\u22122 were estimated, with a general increase in heat flow from the southern parts towards the northern parts of the study area. These relatively high geothermal gradient and heat flow may be associated with the mineralogical, thermal and tectonic history of the area, suggesting the study area has the potential of geothermal energy."}{"Integrated groundwater potentials studies, aquifer hydraulic characterisation and vulnerability investigations of parts of Ndokwa, Niger Delta Basin, Nigeria ": "Field geological and geophysical (Vertical Electrical Sounding VES) survey data were used in investigating groundwater potentials, aquifer characteristics and vulnerability in parts of Ndokwa area, Niger Delta, Nigeria. Data from twenty-one (21) representative VES survey points using Schlumberger configuration were acquired, processed and interpreted. Pumping test data and litho-log data from existing boreholes in the area were used to constrain interpretation and correlation of the VES results. The results revealed five to six geo-electric layers/units across the study area. The subsurface lithology is predominantly sandstone intercalated, in some cases, with clay, sandy clay, and clayey sand. Results also revealed the average depth to aquifer as 71.91\u00a0m (10.33\u2013173.97\u00a0m); average aquifer thickness as 42.52\u00a0m (4.7\u2013149.7\u00a0m) and average aquifer resistivity value as 1289\u00a0\u03a9m (470.84\u20132697.7\u00a0\u03a9m). Average overburden thickness was estimated to be 28.53\u00a0m (4.28\u201362.44\u00a0m). Aquifer characteristics derived from the VES results gave average calculated aquifer transmissivity value as 1162.31\u00a0m2/day (129.54\u20134181.31\u00a0m2/day), and average calculated aquifer hydraulic conductivity as 27.28\u00a0m/day (25.69\u201328.92\u00a0m/day). Longitudinal conductance values range of 0.006\u20130.137 were recorded from geo-electric field survey data in the area, indicating dominance of sand and sparse distribution of clay; and suggesting that the Aquifer Protective Capacity APC of the overburden above the aquifers in the study area is mostly poor to weak and prone to contamination from infiltration. The DRASTIC model was applied to ascertain the DRASTIC Index and compute aquifer vulnerability distribution of the area; and it revealed that the study area is characterised by low \u2013 moderate \u2013 high vulnerability at different locations. Topsoil corrosivity studies showed that topsoil in the area is practically non-corrosive to slightly corrosive. The results of this study have implications for groundwater resources development and management in the study area."}{"\n               In-situ oxidation effect on pore size distribution in investigating adsorption properties under various geochemical conditions ": "Redox affected pumice tuff was used to investigate the changes of pore properties due to oxidation and its possible consequences to adsorption of nuclides on it. Porosity and pore size distribution were analyzed by mercury injection technique and scanning electron microscopy. Batch experiment was carried out with 1\u00a0cm3 block shaped intact pumice tuff samples to determine adsorption coefficient, K\n                     d at several pH, ionic strength and initial nuclide concentrations of stable cesium (133Cs). Pore area, surface area and specific surface area were determined from pore size distribution data before and after adsorption experiment and later compared between fresh and oxidized samples. The results showed that reduction of less than 0.33\u00a0\u03bcm size micro pores due to oxidation is mainly responsible for reducing surface areas, eventually reducing the sorption quantity. Influence of pore properties became negligible in redox affected pumice tuff indicating inverse relation of oxidation phenomena with adsorption coefficients values."}{"Application of three approaches for quantitative AOP development to renal toxicity ": "While hazard assessment of chemicals can make direct use of descriptive adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), risk assessment requires quantitative relationships from exposure to effect timing and magnitude. To seamlessly integrate the data generated by alternative methods or in vivo testing, quantitative AOPs (qAOPs) providing dose-time-response predictions are more valuable than qualitative AOPs. Here, we compare three approaches to qAOP building: empirical dose-response modeling, Bayesian network (BN) calibration, and systems biology (SB) modeling. These methods were applied to the quantification of a simplified oxidative stress induced chronic kidney disease AOP, on the basis of in vitro data obtained on RPTEC/TERT1 cells exposed to potassium bromate. Effectopedia was used to store the experimental data and the developed models in a unified representation so they can be compared and further analyzed. We argue that despite the fact that dose-response models give adequate fits to the data they should be accompanied by mechanistic SB modeling to gain a proper perspective on the quantification. BNs can be both more precise than dose-response models and simpler than SB models, but more experience with their usage is needed."}{"EPA\u2019s DSSTox database: History of development of a curated chemistry resource supporting computational toxicology research ": "The US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database, launched publicly in 2004, currently exceeds 875\u202fK substances spanning hundreds of lists of interest to EPA and environmental researchers. From its inception, DSSTox has focused curation efforts on resolving chemical identifier errors and conflicts in the public domain towards the goal of assigning accurate chemical structures to data and lists of importance to the environmental research and regulatory community. Accurate structure-data associations, in turn, are necessary inputs to structure-based predictive models supporting hazard and risk assessments. In 2014, the legacy, manually curated DSSTox_V1 content was migrated to a MySQL data model, with modern cheminformatics tools supporting both manual and automated curation processes to increase efficiencies. This was followed by sequential auto-loads of filtered portions of three public datasets: EPA\u2019s Substance Registry Services (SRS), the National Library of Medicine\u2019s ChemID, and PubChem. This process was constrained by a key requirement of uniquely mapped identifiers (i.e., CAS RN, name and structure) for each substance, rejecting content where any two identifiers were conflicted either within or across datasets. This rejected content highlighted the degree of conflicting, inaccurate substance-structure ID mappings in the public domain, ranging from 12% (within EPA SRS) to 49% (across ChemID and PubChem). Substances successfully added to DSSTox from each auto-load were assigned to one of five qc_levels, conveying curator confidence in each dataset. This process enabled a significant expansion of DSSTox content to provide better coverage of the chemical landscape of interest to environmental scientists, while retaining focus on the accuracy of substance-structure-data associations. Currently, DSSTox serves as the core foundation of EPA\u2019s CompTox Chemicals Dashboard [https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard], which provides public access to DSSTox content in support of a broad range of modeling and research activities within EPA and, increasingly, across the field of computational toxicology."}{"Regulatory acceptance of in silico approaches for the safety assessment of cosmetic-related substances ": "In silico approaches are becoming increasingly important tools in toxicology. This is especially the case for the cosmetics industry, where growing numbers of regions are implementing bans on the in vivo testing of ingredients and products, resulting in an increased need to be able to generate safety data in vitro and/or in silico. \u2018In silico\u2019 data include results obtained from (quantitative) structure activity relationship ((Q)SAR) models, chemical categories, grouping, read-across and physiologically-based (pharmaco)kinetic (PB(P)K) models, and \u2018big data\u2019 analysis. There are general and more specific factors to be considered when using different in silico methods, many of which are described in the multitude of guidance documents available to support their use for regulatory purposes. There are particular challenges associated with the use of in silico approaches for cosmetic safety assessment, but with proper consideration and justification as to how they have been addressed, none should be insurmountable. Whilst in silico methods are currently predominantly used for internal rather than regulatory decision making, as confidence grows in their applicability and predictivity, this is likely to change. Many of the most commonly cited issues with the use of in silico approaches relate to the need for better documentation and justification as to why the method used was appropriate. It is also frequently stated that they should be used within a weight of evidence (WoE) approach and with all available data, rather than meeting regulatory requirements as a stand-alone method. Whilst these considerations are important, it should be remembered that they are equally applicable to data generated using in vitro and in vivo methods."}{"Mechanistic skin penetration model by the COSMOperm method: Routes of permeation, vehicle effects and skin variations in the healthy and compromised skin ": "A computational skin model has been constructed, representing the composition of a human skin, including short- and long chain ceramides, cholesterol and fatty acids in the stratum corneum, and differentiated model systems in the viable epidermis. The COSMOperm based method uses a set of membrane systems to predict skin permeabilities with an accuracy of rmsd\u202f=\u202f0.72 log k\n                     p units for both non-polar and polar substances, including ionic protonation states. The membrane systems can be varied to model different grades of hydration and skin penetration enhancers. In addition, the release of substances from vehicle matrices is taken into account. The COSMOperm method calculates substance-specific free energy and diffusion profiles within a biological barrier of interest from COSMO-RS calculations. They are based on first-principle quantum chemical structures and surface polarities. The skin model was constructed using a new methodology called COSMOplex, originally developed for a self-consistent simulation of inhomogeneous surfactant, micelle and microemulsion systems. The skin penetration results are obtained quickly within minutes, i.e., many orders of magnitude faster than with molecular dynamics simulations. It will be shown that this mechanistic model should be able to cover variations of the skin composition and penetration pathways in the healthy and compromised skin."}{"\n               In silico site-directed mutagenesis of the Daphnia magna ecdysone receptor identifies critical amino acids for species-specific and inter-species differences in agonist binding ": "Molting is an essential process in the life cycle of arthropods and is regulated by complex neuroendocrine pathways where activation of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) plays a major role. The EcR forms a non-covalent heterodimer with the ultraspiracle protein (USP) when activated by endogenous ecdysteroids, but can also be activated by several insecticides and other environmental chemicals. Environmental release of exogenous chemicals may thus represent a risk to non-target species due to phylogenetic conservation of the EcR in arthropods. In the present study, structural analysis and homology models of the EcR from the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna were used to characterise the agonist binding pocket and identify amino acids responsible for differences in agonist binding between arthropod species. The analysis showed that the binding pockets of steroidal and non-steroidal agonists are partly overlapping, and the phylogenetically conserved Thr59 is a key residue for binding both types of agonists. In silico site-directed mutagenesis and MM-GBSA dG calculations revealed that Cys100 (D. magna numbering) is a structural determinant for cross species affinities. Other determinants are Val129 for both types of agonists, Thr132 for steroidal agonists and Asp134 for non-steroidal agonists. The present results can be used to predict cross species sensitivity for EcR agonists, and shows that homology modelling and affinity predictions may contribute to identifying susceptible species for EcR-mediated endocrine disruption."}{"Integration of curated and high-throughput screening data to elucidate environmental influences on disease pathways ": "Addressing the complex relationship between public health and environmental exposure requires multiple types and sources of data. An important source of chemical data derives from high-throughput screening (HTS) efforts, such as the Tox21/ToxCast program, which aim to identify chemical hazard using primarily in vitro assays to probe toxicity. While most of these assays target specific genes, assessing the disease-relevance of these assays remains challenging. Integration with additional data sets may help to resolve these questions by providing broader context for individual assay results. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), a publicly available database that builds networks of chemical, gene, and disease information from manually curated literature sources, offers a promising solution for contextual integration with HTS data. Here, we tested the value of integrating data across Tox21/ToxCast and CTD by linking elements common to both databases (i.e., assays, genes, and chemicals). Using polymarcine and Parkinson\u2019s disease as a case study, we found that their union significantly increased chemical-gene associations and disease-pathway coverage. Integration also enabled new disease associations to be made with HTS assays, expanding coverage of chemical-gene data associated with diseases. We demonstrate how integration enables development of predictive adverse outcome pathways using 4-nonylphenol, branched as an example. Thus, we demonstrate enhancements to each data source through database integration, including scenarios where HTS data can efficiently probe chemical space that may be understudied in the literature, as well as how CTD can add biological context to those results."}{"\n               In silico-guided optimisation of oxygen gradients in hepatic spheroids ": "One of the key advantages of assessing the hepatotoxic potential of xenobiotics in spheroids rather than monolayer cell culture is the existence of a more physiologically relevant testing environment. Three-dimensional cultures support spatial gradients in nutrients such as oxygen that can be exploited to better represent in vivo gradients that exist along a fundamental sub-unit of liver microarchitecture, the liver sinusoid. The physical and physiological processes that result in the establishment of such gradients can be described mathematically. Quantification of the rates governing these processes and optimisation of cell culture conditions can be performed in silico to better inform experimental design. In this study, we take into account cell line-specific physiological properties, spheroid size and the impact of experimental equipment geometries in order to demonstrate how mathematical models can be optimised to achieve specific in vivo-like features in different scenarios. Furthermore, the sensitivity of such optimised gradients is analysed with respect to culture conditions and considerations are given to prevent the emergence of hypoxic regions in the spheroid. The methodology presented provides an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms of the system within this simulated in vitro framework such that experimental design can be more carefully calibrated when conducting experiments using hepatic spheroids."}{"\n               In silico approaches for prediction of genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of cosmetic ingredients ": "Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity assessment is an essential part of the human health safety assessment of all types of substances, including pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, pesticides, food additives, cosmetics ingredients. The possibility to predict with a sufficient degree of reliability, the genotoxicity and/or carcinogenicity potential of a chemical by means of in silico quantitative approaches is a topic of high interest for health prevention strategies and regulatory frameworks.\n                  In Europe, the safety evaluation of cosmetics is based on the evaluation of each individual ingredient. The marketing of cosmetic products experimentally tested on animals is actually completely banned in the EU and an increasing number of countries is now following this ban as well. This means that the cosmetic industry has an urgent need for alternative approaches for the safety assessment of ingredients of consumer products.\n                  In recent decades, much attention has been given to the use and further development of innovative non testing strategies based on categories, grouping, Read-Across and (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationships ((Q)SARs), to be used in isolation or in combination with in vitro assays. This paper presents an overview of the most important in silico approaches for prediction of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, regulatory initiatives and frameworks with a special emphasis on cosmetics."}{"The CO2 inventory on Mars ": "We use spacecraft measurements to determine the inventory of CO2 gas on Mars. We estimate the amounts of gas from an early, thicker Martian atmosphere that have been lost to space by impact ejection and by solar and solar-wind stripping, and that have been removed to non-atmospheric reservoirs of CO2 ice, clathrate hydrate, adsorbed gas, or carbonate minerals. Loss to space has removed 1\u20132\u202fbars of CO2. Deeply buried carbonates may contain up to the equivalent of a bar of CO2, with the other sinks likely containing no more than \u223c90\u202fmbar of CO2. These sinks can readily account for loss of the bulk of an early CO2 atmosphere thought to be necessary to provide early greenhouse warming. Loss of CO2 from the atmosphere to these sinks is the likely explanation for the transition in climate from an early, warmer atmosphere to the cold, dry atmosphere that has been present since early in the Hesperian epoch."}{"Uranus and Neptune missions: A study in advance of the next Planetary Science Decadal Survey ": "The ice giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, represent an important and relatively unexplored class of planet. Most of our detailed information about them comes from fleeting looks by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in the 1980s. Voyager, and ground-based work since then, found that these planets, their satellites, rings, and magnetospheres, challenge our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We also now know that Uranus-Neptune size planets are common around other stars. These are some of the reasons ice giant exploration was a high priority in NASA's most recent Planetary Science Decadal Survey. In preparation for the next Decadal Survey, NASA, with ESA participation, conducted a broad study of possible ice giant missions in the 2024\u20132037 timeframe. This paper summarizes the key results of the study, and addresses questions that have been raised by the science community and in a recent NASA review. Foremost amongst these are questions about the science objectives, the science payload, and the importance of an atmospheric probe. The conclusions of the NASA/ESA study remain valid. In particular, it is a high priority to send an orbiter and atmospheric probe to at least one of the ice giants, with instrumentation to study all components of an ice giant system. Uranus and Neptune are found to be equally compelling as science targets. The two planets are not equivalent, however, and each system has things to teach us the other cannot. An additional mission study is needed to refine plans for future exploration of these worlds."}{"Figuring out how life first took off is (much like) rocket science! ": "A pedagogical comparison of emergence-of-life research and rocket science is made in order to inform how environmental disequilibria at the ocean/crust interface on the early Earth \u2013 a 1\u202fV battery \u2013 forced life's emergence as an inescapable mechanism for their dissipation. Likely fuels and oxidants to drive life into being were hydrogen plus methane, borne by rising alkaline hydrothermal solutions, juxtaposed with ocean waters containing dilute nitric plus carbonic acids carbureted along the outside of a spontaneously precipitated semipermeable metal hydroxide/sulfide mound. As a comparison, hydrogen and methane can also be used as fuels for rockets, with nitric acid as an oxidant, carefully distributed through the mixing head to the combustion chamber. Whereas a full burn is the goal of the rocket engineer, the first living entities were best served by incomplete reactions and thereby the production of metastable intermediates that could further interact to beat the first metabolic pathway to life. In this analogy the hydrothermal mound is broadly comparable to the rocket while individual engines comprise the variable valence and conformationally flexible mineral, green rust (\u223c[Fe2+\n                     4Fe3+\n                     2(OH12]2+[CO3.3H2O]2-) dosed with Ni, Co, Mo and W. With its internal layers of water and counter ions, we also compare the operations of green rust to a slow ramjet. This green rust \u2018ramjet\u2019 is driven by steep gradients in protons, electrons, anions and uncharged molecules, through the hydrous interlayers from either side of the mineral membrane separating the contrasting fluids and which green rust partly comprises. The mineral can rapidly reduce nitrate to ammonia and, therefrom, aminate pyruvate to the amino acid alanine. The higher amino acids may also be synthesized and polymers thereby act as primitive proteins, enzymes and cell walls. The main challenge now is to figure out how this green rust system, with its variable valence pattern of 2\u00a0\u200b+\u00a0\u200band 3\u00a0\u200b+\u00a0\u200bcations, could govern growth and reproduction and, eventually, evolve toward a replicative world partly governed by nucleotides. Inanimate rockets of course, need their guidance systems installed, and most are fully autonomous."}{"Biosignature detection by Mars rover equivalent instruments in samples from the CanMars Mars Sample Return Analogue Deployment ": "This work details the laboratory analysis of a suite of 10 samples collected from an inverted fluvial channel near Hanksville, Utah, USA as a part of the CanMars Mars Sample Return Analogue Deployment (MSRAD). The samples were acquired along the rover traverse for detailed off-site analysis to evaluate the TOC and astrobiological significance of the samples selected based on site observations, and to address one of the science goals of the CanMars mission: to evaluate the ability of different analytical techniques being employed by the Mars2020 mission to detect and characterize any present biosignatures. Analytical techniques analogous to those on the ExoMars, MSL and the MER rovers were also applied to the samples. The total organic carbon content of the samples was <0.02% for all but 4 samples, and organic biosignatures were detected in multiple samples by UV\u2013Vis\u2013NIR reflectance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy (532\u202fnm, time-resolved, and UV), which was the most effective of the techniques. The total carbon content of the samples is\u202f<\u202f0.3\u202fwt% for all but one calcite rich sample, and organic C was not detectable by FTIR. Carotene and chlorophyll were detected in two samples which also contained gypsum and mineral phases of astrobiological importance for paleoenvironment/habitability and biomarker preservation (clays, gypsum, calcite). They were detected and characterized by multiple techniques, of which passive reflectance was most effective. The sample selected in the field (S2) as having the highest potential for TOC did not have the highest TOC value, however, when considering the sample mineralogy in conjunction with the detection of organic carbon, it is the most astrobiologically relevant. These results highlight the importance of applying multiple techniques for sample characterization and provide insights into their strengths and limitations."}{"The upper atmosphere of Venus: Model predictions for mass spectrometry measurements ": "Venus is the closest and most similar planet to Earth in the whole solar system, yet, basic measurements are missing. The atmospheric composition has been studied to some extent with the Pioneer Venus Orbiter mission and the more recent Venus Express, however, the concentration of many species and their isotopic ratios are not yet known with satisfying accuracy. Especially when it comes to the heavy noble gases as Kr and Xe, there is little to no collected data in this field. These elements form a key link to the reconstruction of the atmospheric evolution, which would deliver crucial information on the formation of Earth-like bodies. Knowing the abundances of the noble gases may allow us to answer the question why Venus did not evolve to a potentially habitable planet like its neighbour Earth.\n                  This paper presents a meta-study of existing observations of Venus' upper atmosphere and exosphere and an exospheric model of the thermal and hot atmosphere of Venus above the homopause. Mass spectra for possible future Venus missions are predicted, as for example the EnVision mission of ESA. The main focus are the heavy noble gases and requirements for the trajectories are proposed. In addition, mass spectra and recommended integration times for the Venus flyby of ESA's JUICE mission are derived."}{"Chaotic orbit determination in the context of the JUICE mission ": "Tidal dissipation within Io and Jupiter leads to a migration of the Galilean satellites. In fact, the resonant interaction between Io, Europa and Ganymede spreads the dissipative effects from Io to the orbits of the other moons. The amount of the loss of energy and the consequent rate of the orbital evolution was determined in (Lainey et\u00a0al., 2009), along with the dissipative parameters \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 k\n                              \n                              \n                                 2\n                              \n                           \n                           /\n                           Q\n                        \n                      of Io and Jupiter. Although this could be considered the most reliable result in literature, there are other articles with different solutions of the moons migration. In this context, the future ESA space mission JUICE can play a key role: during its flybys tour of the Galilean satellites and an orbiting phase around Ganymede, it will provide new extremely accurate observations of the Jovian system, with which it will be possible to constrain moons\u2019 physical properties and orbits.

However, the multiple flybys trajectory is well known to be chaotic, raising critical issues both in the design of the mission and in the orbit determination experiments.\n                  In this article we present the results of simulations using JUICE data from two different experiments (3GM and PRIDE). Differently from (Dirkx et\u00a0al., 2017), we perform a simultaneous estimation of the spacecraft and Galilean satellites\u2019 orbits, along with some dynamical parameters of interest. We will show that adopting the constrained multi-arc strategy during the chaotic phase, we manage to improve the determination of the dissipative parameters, as expected by (Serra et\u00a0al., 2018). Although a complete estimation of all the relevant parameters will be addressed in future works, in this preliminary study we find a formal uncertainty of the two \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 k\n                              \n                              \n                                 2\n                              \n                           \n                           /\n                           Q\n                        \n                      of the same order of (Lainey et\u00a0al., 2009). This implies that the content of information provided by JUICE is similar to the one hundred years astrometric observations used in the same article. Therefore, with JUICE data we will be able to check results and theories of previous studies about the dissipation in the Jovian system, and once added to the other available data sets, we could get a more accurate solution, covering a time span greater than the 4 years of the mission."}{"Modelling DESTINY+ interplanetary and interstellar dust measurements en route to the active asteroid (3200) Phaethon ": "The JAXA/ISAS spacecraft DESTINY+ will be launched to the active asteroid (3200) Phaethon in 2022. Among the proposed core payload is the DESTINY+ Dust Analyzer (DDA) which is an upgrade of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer flown on the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn (Srama et\u00a0al., 2011). We use two up-to-date computer models, the ESA Interplanetary Meteoroid Engineering Model (IMEM, Dikarev et\u00a0al., 2005a, c), and the interstellar dust module of the Interplanetary Meteoroid environment for EXploration model (IMEX;Sterken et\u00a0al. 2013; Strub et\u00a0al., 2019) to study the detection conditions and fluences of interplanetary and interstellar dust with DDA. Our results show that a statistically significant number of interplanetary and interstellar dust particles will be detectable with DDA during the 4-years interplanetary cruise of DESTINY+. The particle impact direction and speed can be used to descriminate between interstellar and interplanetary particles and likely also to distinguish between cometary and asteroidal particles."}{"On the determination of Jupiter's satellite-dependent Love numbers from Juno gravity data ": "The Juno gravity experiment, among the nine instruments onboard the spacecraft, is aimed at studying the interior structure of Jupiter to gain insight into its formation. Doppler data collected during the first two gravity-dedicated orbits completed by Juno around the gas giant have already provided a measurement of Jupiter's gravity field with outstanding accuracy, answering crucial questions about its interior composition. The large dataset that will be collected throughout the remaining phases of the mission until the end in July 2021 might allow to determine Jupiter's response to the satellite-dependent tidal perturbation raised by its moons, and even to separate the static and dynamic effects.\n                  We report on numerical simulations performed over the full science mission to assess the sensitivity of Juno gravity measurements to satellite-dependent tides on Jupiter. We assumed a realistic simulation scenario that is coherent with the result of data analysis from the first gravity passes. Furthermore, we implemented a satellite-dependent tidal model within the dynamical model used to fit the simulated Doppler data.\n                  The formal uncertainties resulting from the covariance analysis show that Juno is indeed sensitive to satellite-dependent tides on Jupiter raised by the inner Galilean satellites (the static Love numbers of degree and order 2 of Io, Europa and Ganymede can be determined respectively to 0.28%, 4.6% and 5.3% at 1 sigma). This unprecedented determination, that will be carried out towards the end of the mission, could further constrain the interior structure of the planet, allowing to discern among interior models and improving existing theories of planetary tidal response."}{"A microporous metal-organic framework of sql topology for C2H2/CO2 separation ": "A new two-dimensional (2D) microporous metal-organic framework, [Cu(BDC-2Br)(H2O)]\u00b7DMF (UTSA-83, DMF\u202f=\u202fN,N\u2019-dimethylformamide), has been synthesized by solvothermal reaction of 4,6-dibromoisophthalic acid (H2BDC-2Br) and Cu(NO3)2\u00b72.5H2O. Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic study reveals that the Cu(II) atoms in UTSA-83 are linked by BDC-2Br ligands to form square grid-like (sql) layers, further stacking together via multiple hydrogen bonding interactions. The removal of DMF molecules allows UTSA-83a to exhibit permanent porosity. Gas sorption measurements of UTSA-83 exhibited selective acetylene (C2H2) adsorption over carbon dioxide (CO2) with a C2H2/CO2 uptake ratio of about 3.1 at 298\u202fK and 1\u202fatm, giving a C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 6.2."}{"Copper(I) SNS pincer complexes: Impact of ligand design and solvent coordination on conformer interconversion from spectroscopic and computational studies ": "The syntheses and detailed characterizations (X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, infrared spectroscopy, electrospray mass spectrometry, and elemental analyses) of two new Cu(I) pincer complexes are reported.

In the crystal structure, the ligand is monoprotonated (Hbtec3\u2212) with six Hbtec3\u2212 adopting the monodentate, bidentate chelating and bidentate chelating-bridging coordination modes, leading to the formation of a 3-D coordination network. Solid state luminescence spectrum showed the characteristic 5D4\u202f\u2192\u202f7FJ (J\u202f=\u202f6\u20132) transitions of the Tb3+ ion upon excitation in the Hbtec3\u2212 singlet levels, revealing that the ligand Hbtec3\u2212 is a good sensitizer for the intense green emission of Tb3+ ions. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed CN 1 has exceptional thermal stability decomposing at temperatures higher than 470\u202f\u00b0C.

The physical and chemical characterization of these MOF materials were studied by elemental analysis (CHN), Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), BET surface area and thermogravimetric analyses. The synthesized MOF materials were used as a modifier for carbon paste electrode to study its electrochemical behaviour towards ferricyanide.

Their X-ray crystal structures show distorted square-planar Pt(II) coordination geometry with \u03c0-stacking between adjacent planar Pt units. These complexes intercalate into DNA with similar binding ability as their chlorido analogues and generate singlet oxygen upon irradiation with blue light (420\u202fnm). Photoactivation of azido complexes leads to the release of the azide ligands and the formation of new platinum species.

Ancillary ligands carry favorable light-harvesting abilities and are therefore crucial in determining the overall power conversion efficiencies.\n                  This review aims to provide insight into the relationship between amphiphilic photosensitizer structure and DSSC properties, which can further guide the function-oriented design and synthesis of different photosensitizers for DSSCs. This review outlines how the new and rapidly expanding class of amphiphilic photosensitizers metal free as well as ruthenium complexes. Introduction of amphiphilicity in photosensitizers provides an enhancing in the performance and stability of DSSCs. These classes of photosensitizer gained interest for feasible large-scale commercialization of DSSCs due to their more favorable light-harvesting abilities and long-term thermal and chemical stabilities compared with other conventional sensitizers. Therefore, the main idea is to collect data of researchers to explore advancement in the design of new amphiphilic photosensitizer for DSSCs."}{"Novel water soluble 7-oxy-4-(pyridine-3-yl)coumarin substituted phthalocyanines as potential photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy ": "The new phthalonitriles (1 and 2) and zinc, indium, magnesium metalled tetrasubstituted phthalocyanines bearing 7-oxy-4-(pyridine-3-yl)coumarin substituents in the peripheral (1a-c)/non-peripheral (2a-c) positions were prepared for the develop novel water-soluble phthalocyanines.

Despite the lack of recycling and the presence of severe plastic pollution in many African countries, MPs have been scarcely reported in African freshwaters and the current study gives the first empirical account for West Africa. The study investigates MP pollution in an important West African river system (Osun River system, Nigeria) and gives an insight into microplastic contamination in a main European river (Rhine River), using gastropods which are potential consumers of MPs, from both systems. From the Osun River system, the most common gastropods (Lanistes varicus and Melanoides tuberculata) were analysed for MP contamination. Two MP types (fibre and film) were recorded in L. varicus, whereas only fibre was recorded in M. tuberculata. Micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (\u03bcFTIR) revealed that the MP films in the African gastropods were made of polyethylene and strongly resembled black polyethylene bags that covered the Osun River banks. From the Rhine River, the gastropod Theodoxus fluviatilis was analysed and nylon as well as polypropylene fibres were found. In both systems (Osun River and Rhine River), fibre was the dominant MP type. In conclusion, the study shows that MP contamination in Nigeria, a West African country with a lack of recycling and poor waste management practice, is reflected in two different local gastropod species. Furthermore, the comparison with a European gastropod species shows that fibres are the dominant MP type in gastropods from both freshwater systems. In both systems, MPs ingested by the gastropods could be transferred to higher trophic levels following predation. We therefore recommend that more empirical studies should be carried out along different feeding guilds of African freshwater invertebrates and fish. When MPs are transferred to fish, MPs may reach humans through fish consumption."}{"Effects of nutrient load from St. Jones River on water quality and eutrophication in Lake George, Florida ": "Nutrient contamination in surface waters can pose a health risk for humans and aquatic life. The influx of Nitrogen and Phosphorus can cause an increase in algal blooms resulting in eutrophication of the water body. Eutrophication describes the trophic state or the health of a water body as it relates to the level of algae biomass. Water quality for this research is represented by the presence of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) which is an indicator of the activity within the water body. In this study, trophic state analysis and relations between Chl-a and nutrients in Lake George, Florida, have been conducted. Three zones within Lake George are established to prepare a succinct analysis of the existing monthly and seasonal averages across the water body. Statistical analyses, including multiple regression analysis, were used in this study to establish the relationship between Chl-a and nutrients, Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP). Traditional single-variable regression analysis shows good correlations between the Chl-a and TN loading and poor relationship with TP, which indicate that TN loading is the controlling factor. Single-variable regression was also used to compare the inlet load contributions to the lake loading which was found to be conclusive. Multivariate regression analysis for all three zones were conducted to obtain acceptable to good relationship between Chl-a and nutrient (TN, TP) with the monthly R values for zones 1, 2, 3, are 0.72, 0.82, and 0.80 respectively, indicating nutrient is the dominant factor for eutrophication in the lake. Multivariate regression equations between Chl-a and nutrient (TN,TP) were used to investigate scenarios to reduce nutrient load at the inlet so as to control Chl-a concentrations in the lake to avoid eutrophic conditions. It was found that the TN inlet loading would have to be reduced by more than 75% for zone 1, 65% in zone 2 and less than 25% for zone 3 in order to not exceed the current EPA approved numeric criteria for Florida Lakes. It was also determined that both TN and TP concentrations are co-limiting in the lake based on Carlson\u2019s criteria. Assessments by both Trophic State Index (TSI) method and Total Nutrient Status Index (TNI) methods indicate eutrophic conditions in the lake under current conditions."}{"Photodegradation of algae and macrophyte-derived dissolved organic matter: A multi-method assessment of DOM transformation ": "Due to the frequent occurrence of algal bloom and eutrophication, algae and macrophyte-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) play a more important role in the lake environment. In the study, algae and macrophyte-derived DOM were exposed for 30 days either in the dark or light in order to develop a broader understanding of their photochemical and microbial transformation. Changes of quantification and quality of DOM were characterized by Uv\u2013vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Simulated solar UV exposure (30 d) without sterilization removed 49.7% and 42.4% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from chlorella and water chestnut DOM, respectively. In contrast, 31.6% and 22.2% of DOC were removed under dark conditions accordingly. Compared with humic OM, autochthonous DOM was more biolabile and less photolabile, with less photochemical removal of DOC in this study. Molecular structures of studied DOM exhibited selective alterations during incubation. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that fulvic acid-like substances were susceptible to photodegradation, while protein-like substances were susceptible to both photodegradation and biodegradation. Furthermore, analytic results of carbon functional groups suggested that polysaccharides were more biolabile; aromatics were more photolabile; and phenols/aromatic proteins were both biolabile and photolabile. The higher proportion of aliphatics and lower proportion of aromatics in autochthonous DOM might be the primary cause of their greater biodegradation and weaker photodegradation."}{"Microplastics in freshwaters and drinking water: Critical review and assessment of data quality ": "Microplastics have recently been detected in drinking water as well as in drinking water sources. This presence has triggered discussions on possible implications for human health. However, there have been questions regarding the quality of these occurrence studies since there are no standard sampling, extraction and identification methods for microplastics. Accordingly, we assessed the quality of fifty studies researching microplastics in drinking water and in its major freshwater sources. This includes an assessment of microplastic occurrence data from river and lake water, groundwater, tap water and bottled drinking water. Studies of occurrence in wastewater were also reviewed. We review and propose best practices to sample, extract and detect microplastics and provide a quantitative quality assessment of studies reporting microplastic concentrations. Further, we summarize the findings related to microplastic concentrations, polymer types and particle shapes. Microplastics are frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water, and number concentrations spanned ten orders of magnitude (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122 to 108 #/m3) across individual samples and water types. However, only four out of 50 studies received positive scores for all proposed quality criteria, implying there is a significant need to improve quality assurance of microplastic sampling and analysis in water samples. The order in globally detected polymers in these studies is PE\u202f\u2248\u202fPP\u202f>\u202fPS\u202f>\u202fPVC\u202f>\u202fPET, which probably reflects the global plastic demand and a higher tendency for PVC and PET to settle as a result of their higher densities. Fragments, fibres, film, foam and pellets were the most frequently reported shapes. We conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water, to better understand potential exposure and to inform human health risk assessments."}{"Continuous ozonation of urban wastewater: Removal of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and antibiotic resistance genes and phytotoxicity ": "This work evaluated the removal of a mixture of eight antibiotics (i.e. ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLA), ofloxacin (OFL), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and tetracycline (TC)) from urban wastewater, by ozonation operated in continuous mode at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (i.e. 10, 20, 40 and 60\u202fmin) and specific ozone doses (i.e. 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 gO3 gDOC\u2212 1). As expected, the efficiency of ozonation was highly ozone dose- and contact time-dependent. The removal of the parent compounds of the selected antibiotics to levels below their detection limits was achieved with HRT of 40\u202fmin and specific ozone dose of 0.125 gO3 gDOC\u2212 1. The effect of ozonation was also investigated at a microbiological and genomic level, by studying the efficiency of the process with respect to the inactivation of Escherichia coli and antibiotic-resistant E.\u00a0coli, as well as to the reduction of the abundance of selected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The inactivation of total cultivable E.\u00a0coli was achieved under the experimental conditions of HRT 40\u202fmin and 0.25 gO3 gDOC\u22121, at which all antibiotic compounds were already degraded. The regrowth examinations revealed that higher ozone concentrations were required for the permanent inactivation of E.\u00a0coli below the Limit of Quantification (<LOQ\u202f=\u202f0.01\u202fCFU mL\u2212 1). Also, the abundance of the examined ARGs (intl1, aadA1, dfrA1, qacE\u03941 and sul1) was found to decrease with increasing HRT and ozone dose. Despite the fact that the mildest operating parameters were able to eliminate the parent compounds of the tested antibiotics in wastewater effluents, it was clearly demonstrated in this study that higher ozone doses were required in order to confer permanent damage and/or death and prevent potential post-treatment re-growth of both total bacteria and ARB, and to reduce the abundance of ARGs below the LOQ. Interestingly, the mineralization of wastewater, in terms of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) removal, was found to be significantly low even when the higher ozone doses were applied, leading to an increased phytotoxicity towards various plant species. The findings of this study clearly underline the importance of properly optimising the ozonation process (e.g. specific ozone dose and contact time) taking into consideration both the bacterial species and associated ARGs, as well as the wastewater physicochemical properties (e.g. DOC), in order to mitigate the spread of ARB&ARGs, as well as to reduce the potential phytotoxicity."}{"Antibiotic resistance genes in treated wastewater and in the receiving water bodies: A pan-European survey of urban settings ": "There is increasing public concern regarding the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during wastewater treatment, their persistence during the treatment process and their potential impacts on the receiving water bodies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine the abundance of nine ARGs and a class 1 integron associated integrase gene in 16 wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents from ten different European countries. In order to assess the impact on the receiving water bodies, gene abundances in the latter were also analysed.\n                  Six out of the nine ARGs analysed were detected in all effluent and river water samples. Among the quantified genes, intI1 and sul1 were the most abundant. Our results demonstrate that European WWTP contribute to the enrichment of the resistome in the receiving water bodies with the particular impact being dependent on the effluent load and local hydrological conditions. The ARGs concentrations in WWTP effluents were found to be inversely correlated to the number of implemented biological treatment steps, indicating a possible option for WWTP management.\n                  Furthermore, this study has identified bla\n                     OXA-58 as a possible resistance gene for future studies investigating the impact of WWTPs on their receiving water."}{"Nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment processes \u2013 Origin, impact and potential solutions ": "The presence of nano and microplastics in water has increasingly become a major environmental challenge. A key challenge in their detection resides in the relatively inadequate analytical techniques available preventing deep understanding of the fate of nano/microplastics in water. The occurrence of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment plants poses a concern for the quality of the treated water. Due to their broad but small size and diverse chemical natures, nano/microplastics may travel easily along water and wastewater treatment processes infiltrating remediation processes at various levels, representing operational and process stability challenges. This review aims at presenting the current understanding of the fate and impact of nano/microplastics through water and wastewater treatment plants. The formation and fragmentation mechanisms, physical-chemical properties and occurrence of nano/microplastics in water are correlated to the interactions of nano/microplastics with water and wastewater treatment plant processes and potential solutions to limit these interactions are comprehensively reviewed. This critical analysis offers new strategies to limit the number of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater to keep water quality up to the required standards and reduce threats on our ecosystems."}{"Determinants of presence and removal of antibiotic resistance genes during WWTP treatment: A cross-sectional study ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), linking human fecal residues and the environment, are considered as hotspots for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In order to evaluate the role of WWTPs and underlying operational parameters for the removal of AMR, the presence and removal efficiency of a selected set of 6 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and 2 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) was evaluated by means of qPCR in influent and effluent samples from 62 Dutch WWTPs. The role of possible factors impacting the concentrations of ARGs and MGEs in the influent and their removal was identified through statistical analysis. ARGs and the class I integron-integrase gene (intI1) were, on average, removed to a similar extent (1.76 log reduction) or better (+0.30\u20131.90 logs) than the total bacteria (measured as 16S rRNA gene). In contrast, broad-host-range plasmids (IncP-1) had a significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) relative abundance after treatment. The presence of healthcare institutions in the area served did only slightly increase the concentrations of ARGs or MGEs in influent. From the extended panel of operational parameters, rainfall, increasing the hydraulic load of the plant, most significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) affected the treatment efficiency by decreasing it on average\u00a0\u22120.38 logs per time the flow exceeded the average daily flow. Our results suggest that overall, WWTP treatments do not favor the proliferation of the assessed resistance genes but might increase the relative abundance of broad-host-range plasmids of the IncP-1 type."}{"Spatial ecology of a wastewater network defines the antibiotic resistance genes in downstream receiving waters ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an effective barrier in the protection of human and environment health around the world, although WWTPs also are suggested to be selectors and-or reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) before entering the environment. The dogma about WWTPs as \u201cARG selectors\u201d presumes that biotreatment compartments (e.g., activated sludge; AS) are single densely populated ecosystems with elevated horizontal gene transfer. However, recent work has suggested WWTP biotreatment compartments may be different than previously believed relative to antibiotic resistance (AR) fate, and other process factors, such as bacterial separation and specific waste sources, may be key to ARGs released to the environment. Here we combined 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing and high-throughput qPCR to characterise microbial communities and ARGs across a wastewater network in Spain that includes both community (i.e., non-clinical urban) and hospital sources. Contrary to expectations, ARGs found in downstream receiving waters were not dominated by AS biosolids (RAS), but more resembled raw wastewater sources. In fact, ARGs and microbial communities in liquid-phase WWTP effluents and RAS were significantly different (Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index\u202f=\u202f0.66\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.11), with a consequential fraction of influent ARGs and organisms passing directly through the WWTP with limited association with RAS. Instead, ARGs and organisms in the RAS may be more defined by biosolids separation and biophysical traits, such as flocculation, rather than ARG carriage. This explains why RAS has significantly lower ARG richness (47\u202f\u00b1\u202f4 ARGs) than liquid-phase effluents (104\u202f\u00b1\u202f5 ARGs), and downstream water column (135\u202f\u00b1\u202f4 ARGs) and river sediments (120\u202f\u00b1\u202f5 ARGs) (Tukey's test, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). These data suggest RAS and liquid-phase WWTP effluents may reflect two parallel ecosystems with potentially limited ARG exchange. As such, ARG mitigation in WWTPs should more focus on removing bacterial hosts from the liquid phase, AR source reduction, and possibly disinfection to reduce ARG releases to the environment."}{"Lead release to potable water during the Flint, Michigan water crisis as revealed by routine biosolids monitoring data ": "Routine biosolids monitoring data provides an independent and comprehensive means to estimate water lead release pre-, during and post-Flint Water Crisis (FWC). The mass of potable plumbing-related metals (i.e., lead, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc) in sewage biosolids strongly correlated with one another during the FWC (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). A simple parametric regression model based on 90th percentile potable water lead measurements (WLL90) from five city-wide citizen science sampling efforts August 2015\u2013August 2017 was strongly correlated to corresponding monthly lead mass in biosolids [Biosolids-Pb (kg)\u00a0=\u00a00.483 x WLL90 (\u03bcg/L)\u00a0+\u00a01.79; R2\u202f=\u202f0.86, p\u202f<\u202f0.05]. Although total biosolids lead increased just 14% during the 18 months of the FWC versus the comparable time pre-FWC, 76% of that increase occurred in July\u2013September 2014, and the corresponding percentage of Flint children under 6 years with elevated blood lead \u2265 5\u202f\u03bcg/dL (i.e., %EBL5) doubling from 3.45% to 6.61% in those same three months versus 2013 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). %EBL5 was not statistically higher during the remaining months of the FWC compared to pre-FWC or post-FWC. As expected, lead in biosolids during the FWC, when orthophosphate was not added, was moderately correlated with water temperature (R2\u202f=\u202f0.30, p\u202f<\u202f0.05), but not at other times pre- and post-FWC when orthophosphate was present. Tripling the orthophosphate dose post-FWC versus pre-FWC and some lead pipe removal, decreased lead in biosolids (and %EBL5) to historic lows (2016\u20132017 vs. 2012\u20132013; p\u202f<\u202f0.05), supporting the effectiveness of these public health interventions in reducing childhood water lead exposure."}{"Diversity and antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli populations in hospital and community wastewater compared to wastewater at the receiving urban treatment plant ": "Bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns among the indicator organism Escherichia coli were monitored in wastewater samples collected over one year from a hospital (HW), a community (CW) and the receiving urban (UW) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We compared levels of antibiotic resistance in the different types of wastewater, and identified whether resistant strains were endemic in the wastewater system. If so, implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots (e.g. hospital outlets) could be used to decrease the amount of resistant bacteria in the wastewater. E.\u00a0coli from HW (n\u202f=\u202f2644), CW (n\u202f=\u202f2525) and UW (n\u202f=\u202f2693) were analyzed by biochemical phenotyping (PhenePlate System) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics (AREB System). The phenotypic diversities of the total E.\u00a0coli populations were similar for all three sites (Simpson's Diversity index, Di\u202f=\u202f0.973), however for individual samples, HW showed low diversities (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.800) and the E.\u00a0coli flora was often dominated by strains that may have originated from the fecal flora of single individuals. The diversities in CW samples was higher (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.936), and UW samples showed similar diversities as the whole collection of isolates (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.971). Resistance to at least one of the nine antibiotics was observed in 45% of the HW isolates, 44% of CW isolates, and 33% of UW isolates. Resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol was uncommon (3.2 and 5.3%, respectively), whereas resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was most common (24% and 31%, respectively). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E.\u00a0coli (ESBL-EC) were more common in HW (11.5%) and in CW (6.9%) compared to UW (3.7%). A high diversity (Di\u202f=\u202f0.974) was observed among ESBL-EC isolates from UW (n\u202f=\u202f99), indicating absence of any clonal structure among these isolates. Common PhP types of ESBL-EC often dominated in each HW sample, but were not identified across different samples, whereas ESBL-EC in CW showed low diversity (Di\u202f=\u202f0.857) and were dominated by a specific PhP type that was found across almost all CW samples. The antibiotic resistance rates were highest in hospital wastewater, but surprisingly they were also high in the studied community wastewater, compared to the urban wastewater. The relative contribution of HW seemed low in terms of dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria to the WWTP."}{"Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill: A source of microplastics? -Evidence of microplastics in landfill leachate ": "Although landfill is suspected to be releasing microplastics to the environment, there is few empirical researches carried out. To clarify suspicions of landfills as potential sources of microplastics, twelve leachate samples from four active and two closed municipal solid waste landfills were investigated. Microplastics were found in all the landfill leachate samples. In total, seventeen different types of plastics were identified in the leachate samples with calculated concentration ranging from 0.42 to 24.58 items/L. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the predominant polymer types. 99.36% microplastics were derived from the fragmentation of plastic waste buried in landfills. The size of 77.48% microplastics was between 100 and 1000\u202f\u03bcm. The study shows that the generation, accumulation and release of microplastic in landfills is a long-term process. The results of our study provide preliminary evidence and validate that landfill isn't the final sink of plastics, but a potential source of microplastics."}{"Full-scale comparison of UV/H2O2 and UV/Cl2 advanced oxidation: The degradation of micropollutant surrogates and the formation of disinfection byproducts ": "The photolysis of chlorine by UV light leads to the formation of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) as well as reactive chlorine species (RCS) that can be effective as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water treatment. Much of the research to date has been done at laboratory- or bench-scale. This study reports results from a model that demonstrates that the relative effectiveness of the UV/Cl2 AOP compared to the more traditional UV/H2O2 AOP is a function of optical path length. As such, the relative effectiveness of the two treatment options evaluated at small scale may not reflect the relative performance at full-scale, making results previously obtained at small-scale potentially less scalable. This study therefore compares the performance of UV/Cl2 to UV/H2O2 at a full-scale water treatment plant, using sucralose and caffeine as spiked surrogates for contaminants that are reactive solely to OH radicals, and to both OH and RCS, respectively. pH was varied between 6.5 and 8.0. The results demonstrated that when using a medium pressure UV lamp, UV/Cl2 might lead to approximately twice the production of OH radicals as UV/H2O2 at pH 6.5 when using the same molar oxidant concentration, but adding chlorine to the UV reactor at pH 8.0 had a negligible impact on OH radical concentration in comparison to UV alone. The study also confirmed previous small-scale results that RCS can be a major contributor to UV/Cl2 treatment for compounds such as caffeine that are susceptible to RCS, with UV/Cl2 effective at both pH 6.5 and 8.0 for such compounds. Disinfection byproducts were monitored, with adsorbable organohalide (AOX) formation increasing by approximately 10\u202f\u03bcg-Cl/L due to chlorine photolysis, but only at pH 6.5 and not at pH 8.0. This implies that UV/Cl2 might increase AOX mostly due to reaction between OH and organic precursors to make them more reactive with chlorine, and not due to RCS. The formation of specific DBPs of current or emerging regulatory interest was minimal under all conditions, except for chlorate. Chlorate yields were in the order of 6\u201318% of the photolysed chlorine."}{"Persistent contaminants as potential constraints on the recovery of urban river food webs from gross pollution ": "Urban areas contribute substantially to xenobiotic contaminant loads in rivers, but their effects have been investigated more for individual organisms and sensitive taxa, rather than through the emergent properties of communities. Here, we use replicated, catchment-scale sampling of benthic invertebrates and novel multivariate techniques to assess whether urban wastewater contaminants affected the structure and function of river food webs. We postulated that the continued occurrence of selected contaminants in river systems might explain the incomplete recovery of urban rivers from legacy gross pollution. Benthic invertebrate communities were sampled monthly over a year (2016\u20132017) at 18 sites across 3 river systems in South Wales (United Kingdom). Contaminant sources were characterised using remote sensing, water quality data from routine monitoring and measured concentrations of selected persistent xenobiotic pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers). Urban wastewater discharges had relatively limited effects on river water quality, with small increases in nitrate, phosphate, temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solids in urban systems. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in invertebrates, however, were significantly higher under greater urban land cover and wastewater discharge. Food webs at the most highly contaminated urban sites were characterised by: (i) reduced taxonomic and functional diversity; (ii) simplified food web structure with reduced network connectance; and (iii) reductions in the abundance of prey important for apex predators such as the Eurasian dipper (Cinclus cinclus). Although correlative and partially confounded by other effects, these data provide support for the hypothesis that impairment to food webs resulting from urban pollutants might explain population, community and ecosystem-level effects in urban river systems, and hence incomplete recovery from past pollution."}{"Matrix morphology and the particle dispersion in HDPE nanocomposites with enhanced wear resistance ": "High density polyethylene nanocomposites were prepared by melt mixing of varying type of nanopowders in the presence of vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) coupling agent. Three spherical/irregular-shaped nanopowders, fumed Al2O3, \u03b3-Al2O3, cubic titanium nitride (TiN) (1.5 vol-%), and high aspect ratio graphene oxide platelets (GO) (0.5 vol-%) were investigated in a high molecular weight HDPE matrix. Significant differences in the dispersion quality between the nanopowders were found by TEM and AFM. Degree of crystallinity of the nanocomposites (DSC/XRD) was consistently lower than in the neat HDPE polymer. The particularly well dispersed fumed Al2O3, \u03b3-Al2O3 and GO nanopowders induced significant modification on the micromechanical properties of the HDPE. For the first time, great enhancement in the sliding wear performance, and an improvement in the abrasive wear performance was found in the high molecular weight HDPE nanocomposites. DSC analyses showed elevations in the glass transition temperatures and the peak melting temperatures of the nanocomposites. XRD peak splitting in the HDPE\u00a0+\u00a0GO and the HDPE\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b3-Al2O3 nanocomposites suggest the emergence of a concurrent orthorhombic HDPE phase. Formation of new phases was also supported by DSC analyses showing broad and multimodal melting peaks. Scherrer analyses of XRD data showed slightly increased HDPE crystalline thicknesses in the range of 15\u201320\u202fnm in the nanocomposites, which was in line with the TEM and AFM observations. The great elevation in the melting temperatures of the HDPE nanocomposites with fumed Al2O3 and \u03b3-Al2O3 could not be attributed to the polymer lamellar thickness, but rather to the altered properties of the solid amorphous phase stemming for the nanopowder additives."}{"Effects of nozzle temperature and building orientation on mechanical properties and microstructure of PEEK and PEI printed by 3D-FDM ": "Poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) and polyetherimide (PEI) are typical representatives of special engineering plastics with high heat-resistance and great mechanical properties. The printing parameters during the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process can affect their mechanical properties of printed parts directly or indirectly. In this paper, PEEK and PEI were printed to investigate the relationship of nozzle temperature, building orientation and material properties by analyzing the morphology, chemical composition and SEM. Because of the crystallinity of PEEK material, its printed parts exhibit plasticity, while the printed PEI parts become brittle due to its non-crystallinity, which is reflected in tensile, flexural and impact test. On the one hand, the mechanical properties of their printed parts were deteriorated due to the formation of air pores. On the other hand, PEEK exhibited the better toughness than PEI. All properties of PEEK and PEI parts printed after optimization can reach about 80% of injection molding parts."}{"Synergy between melamine cyanurate, melamine polyphosphate and aluminum diethylphosphinate in flame retarded thermoplastic polyurethane ": "The multicomponent flame retardant system of melamine polyphosphate (MPP), melamine cyanurate (MC) and aluminum diethylphosphinate (AlPi) is proposed and investigated for thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The synergy between those additives and the resulting superior fire performance are discussed. Systematically varied sets of flame retarded TPU with various MPP/MC/AlPi ratios were investigated in terms of fire behavior, pyrolysis products and mechanical properties. The total amount of the additives was always 30\u202fwt.-%. Further, the influence of various AlPi concentrations was investigated. The optimal MPP:MC ratio was determined while keeping the amount of AlPi constant. The combination of 8\u202fwt.-% MPP, 12\u202fwt.-% MC and 10\u202fwt.-% is proposed as the most promising halogen free flame retardant formulation for TPU, because it yielded a reduction in PHRR from 2660\u202fkW/m2 (TPU) to 452\u202fkW/m2 and enabled V-0 classification in the UL 94 test. Combinations of MPP and MC as well a high concentration of AlPi are beneficial for the mechanical properties e.g. tensile strength and elongation at break of the formulations and could be a strong competitor to commercial flame retarded TPUs."}{"Interplay between interlayer exchange and stacking in CrI3 bilayers ": "We address the interplay between stacking and interlayer exchange for ferromagnetically ordered CrI3, both for bilayers and bulk. Whereas bulk CrI3 is ferromagnetic, both magneto-optical and transport experiments show that interlayer exchange for CrI3 bilayers is antiferromagnetic. Bulk CrI3 is known to assume two crystal structures, rhombohedral and monoclinic, that differ mostly in the stacking between monolayers. Below 210\u2013220\u202fK, bulk CrI3 orders in a rhombohedral phase. Our density functional theory calculations show a very strong dependence of interlayer exchange and stacking. Specifically, the ground states of both bulk and free-standing CrI3 bilayers are ferromagnetic for the rhombohedral phase. In contrast, the energy difference between both configurations is more than one order of magnitude smaller for the monoclinic phase, and eventually becomes antiferromagnetic when either positive strain or on-site Hubbard interactions (U\u202f\u2265\u202f3) are considered. We also explore the interplay between interlayer hybridization and stacking, using a Wannier basis, and between interlayer hybridization and relative magnetic alignment for CrI3 bilayers, that helps to account for the very large tunnel magnetoresistance observed in recent experiments."}{"Temperature dependence of the electronic structure of A-site ordered perovskite CaCu3Ti4O12: Angle-integrated and -resolved photoemission studies ": "We have investigated the electronic structure of A-site ordered CaCu3Ti4O12 as a function of temperature by using angle-integrated and -resolved photoemission spectroscopies. Intrinsic changes of the electronic structure have been successfully observed in the valence band region by the careful consideration of charging effects. The obtained photoemission results have revealed that the intensity of the nearly non-dispersive Cu 3d-O 2p hybridized bands at the binding energy of \u223c2\u202feV increases with decreasing temperature from 300 to 120\u202fK. This suggests that the density of the localized states, caused by the strong correlation effects, enhances as the temperature decreases."}{"Exfoliation of Ti2C and Ti3C2 Mxenes from bulk trigonal phases of titanium carbide: A theoretical prediction ": "MXenes, a novel class of two dimensional materials with several interesting properties, are prepared from their MAX phases by etching out the A element using strong chemical reagents. This results in passivation of the surfaces of MXene with different functional groups like O, \u2013OH, \u2013F, etc., which in many cases tend to degrade their properties. In this work, using first principle density functional theory based calculations, we propose a novel method that might open up possibility of synthesizing pristine Ti2C and Ti3C2 from the bulk titanium carbides with corresponding stoichiometry. Based on the values of cleavage energy obtained from our calculations, we envisage that pristine Ti2C and Ti3C2 MXenes can be prepared, using mechanical or sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation techniques, from their bulk phases."}{"Three-dimensional porous boron nitride foam for effective CO2 adsorption ": "3D porous boron nitride (BN) foam with thin boron nitride nanosheets walls has been prepared by a in situ templet-free foaming reaction with ammonia borane and thiourea. Thiourea serves as foaming agent in the synthesis and frothing the precursor into Three-dimensional (3D) structure BN foam with thin walls. The products are hierarchically porous with large area of rough surfaces, presenting high adsorption of N2/CO2. Typically, for CO2 adsorption, it could reach up to 150\u202fml/g under 50\u202fbar\u202fat room temperature."}{"Experimental study of fast-neutron production and moderation for accelerator-based BNCT system ": "This work aims to study the fast-neutron production and moderation for the development of a compact accelerator-based multi-port Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (AB-mBNCT) system. An initial energy distribution and the efficiency of a test moderator assembly (TMA) for fast neutrons from a tungsten (W) target bombarded with a 53\u202fMeV proton beam were measured using organic scintillators. The experimental results were reproduced with reasonable accuracy by simulations using the PHITS code. This paper will discuss about the experimental outcome and the related benchmark calculations by PHITS code."}{"Divergent synthesis of organophosphate [11C]VX- and [11C]Sarin-surrogates from a common set of starting materials ": "Radiolabeled 1-[11C]ethyl, 4-nitrophenyl methylphosphonate (VX surrogate) and 2-[11C]-propanyl, 4-nitrophenyl methylphosphonate (sarin surrogate) were developed as organophosphate (OP) tracers. The [11C]ethyl- and [11C]isopropyl-iodide radiolabeled synthons were obtained by temperature controlled, in loop reactions of [11C]CO2 with MeMgBr followed by reduction with LiAlH4, then reaction with HI. Distillation of the [11C]alkyl iodides into a solution of hydrogen (4-nitrophenyl)methylphosphonate and cesium carbonate afforded the desired tracers in >95% radiochemical purity, yields from [11C]CO2 of 1\u20133% and 1.7\u201315.1 GBq/mmol molar activities."}{"Rare earth elements (REEs) as pollution indicator in sediment of Linggi River, Malaysia ": "A study was carried out to determine the concentrations of rare earth elements (REEs) in Linggi river sediments collected from 113 sampling locations. The sediment analysis was performed by Neutron activation analysis (NAA) and Inductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results of Linggi river sediment were normalized to \u201crecent\u201d reference shale values. The means of total concentrations of REEs (\u03a3REE), light REEs (\u03a3LREE) and heavy REEs (\u03a3HREE) in Linggi sediment were 241.2, 219.2, and 22.0\u202fmg/kg, respectively, which indicates enrichment compared to \u03a3REE, \u03a3LREE and \u03a3HREE reference shale values. Results obtained from enrichment factors (EF) show no enrichment to moderate enrichment of Linggi sediments, indicating the sources of REEs pollution originated from natural and land-based activities. A similar pattern was observed by comparing the REEs values of Linggi sediments to other references shale values. Ce (\u03b4Ce) and Eu (\u03b4Eu) anomalies indicate Linggi sediments showed positive anomaly of Ce whilst negative anomaly of Eu."}{"A low-cost portable system for elemental mapping by XRF aiming in situ analyses ": "This work presents the development of a portable system that allows 2D elemental mapping of large areas (maximum of 35.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f35.0\u202fcm2) by XRF. A measuring head, composed of an x-ray source and a detector, is mounted on a 3-axis stage with movement reproducibility better that 0.03\u202fmm. The final elemental map resolution of 1.4\u202fmm was experimentally determined in the best condition of collimation, and the same experiments indicate that the resolution is fully dominated by the x-ray beam spot size. The main goal of this new setup is to perform analyses of historical, archaeological and geological objects. Because it's lightweight, our setup has the potential to be of great utility for in situ analyses, given the great difficulty and high costs transporting the artifacts from the museum to a laboratory. The importance of this instrumentation is related to the need to identify the distribution of the chemical elements in large surface areas of cultural heritage objects by a nondestructive method."}{"A novel approach to medical radioisotope production using inverse kinematics: A successful production test of the theranostic radionuclide 67Cu ": "A novel method for the production of important medical radioisotopes has been developed. The approach is based on performing the nuclear reaction in inverse kinematics, namely sending a heavy-ion beam of appropriate energy on a light target (e.g. H, d, He) and collecting the isotope of interest. In this work, as a proof-of-concept, we studied the production of the theranostic radionuclide 67Cu (T1/2\u202f=\u202f62\u202fh) via the reaction of a 70Zn beam at 15 MeV/nucleon with a hydrogen gas target. The 67Cu radionuclide alongside other coproduced isotopes, was collected after the gas target on an aluminum catcher foil and their radioactivity was measured by off-line \u03b3-ray analysis. After 36\u202fh post irradiation, apart from the product of interest 67Cu, the main radioimpurity coming from the 70Zn\u00a0+\u00a0p reaction was 69m\n                     Zn (T1/2\u202f=\u202f13.8\u202fh), which can be reduced by further radio-cooling. Moreover, along with the radionuclide of interest produced in inverse kinematics, the production of additional radioisotopes is possible by making use of the forward-focused neutrons from the reaction and allowing them to interact with a secondary target. A preliminary successful test of this concept was realized in the present study. The main requirement to obtain activities appropriate for preclinical studies is the development of high-intensity heavy-ion primary beams."}{"Monte Carlo simulation of an HPGe detector for detection of 239Pu in waste assay system ": "This paper discusses the modeling of HPGe detector used in waste assay system using Monte Carlo code FLUKA to determine its detection limits. The modeled detector is validated using experimental point sources efficiencies in the energy range 60\u202fkeV\u20132000\u202fkeV. The numerical estimation of efficiency values for 239Pu present inside a 230\u202fL cotton filled waste drum at various locations along the axis of the detector is discussed. Estimation of the minimum detectable activity (MDA) for 239Pu at these locations in the presence of 1\u202fMBq of 137Cs/60Co again along the axis of the detector is examined. The efficiency of 239Pu decreases from 6.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-10 to 7.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-11 cps/Bq as the location of 239Pu moves away from the detector. MDA of 239Pu increases as the position of 239Pu and 137Cs/60Co in the waste drum shifts away from the detector while it decreases as the location of 137Cs/60CO moves away from 239Pu along measurement axis. It is observed that for all locations of 137Cs/60Co with 239Pu located up to 200\u202fmm from the edge of the drum, the detection limit is within 140.3\u202fmg (allowed limit)."}{"Evaluation of a radon-in-water pilot-proficiency test ": "A pilot proficiency test (PT) on measurements of the massic activity of 222Rn in drinking water was organised by JRC-Geel. Fourteen environmental radioactivity monitoring laboratories were invited to participate. The key aim of the study was to test, optimise and stream-line the complete process for conducting such a PT in order to perform a large scale Europe-wide PT in a robust manner. The process involved using all state-of-the art knowledge on sampling, transporting and measuring 222Rn in water. It was found that the majority of the participants\u2019 results (92%) were within the \u00b115% reference range. The pilot-PT showed that the applied process was suitable and can be used for the large scale European PT planned for the third quarter of 2018."}{"Multi-radioisotope identification algorithm using an artificial neural network for plastic gamma spectra ": "Radioisotope identification using a plastic scintillation detector has been a challenging issue because of the poor spectral resolution and low cross-sections of these types of detectors when used for photoelectric absorption. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that identifies a single radioisotope and multiple radioisotopes from the gamma spectrum of a plastic scintillator using an artificial neural network. The spectra were simulated using Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code 6 to formulate the training set, and the spectra were measured by a two-inch EJ-200 to create the test set (1440 spectra in total). The ANN-based algorithm presented here ensures an identification accuracy of 98.9% for a single radioisotope and 99.1% for multiple radioisotopes. Even if the spectra were intentionally shifted by 36\u202fkeV for low and high energies, the trained ANN predicts radioisotopes with high accuracy. In addition, we have determined the minimal required number of detected counts to identify the radioisotope with 5% false negative and false positive."}{"Chromium and Lead adsorption by avocado seed biomass study through the use of Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence analysis ": "Adsorption is an effective method for the treatment of wastewater containing low concentrations of heavy metals. This kind of metals such as Chromium and Lead could affect health and the ecosystem. In this work, biomass of avocado seed was used as adsorbent. It was tested as adsorbent in natural form (NB), as a chemically activated (AB) form and as activated carbon (AC). Batch reactors were used to investigate the adsorbent efficiency. Concentration of metal ions was measured using Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence. Operational conditions influencing adsorption, such as: pH, adsorbent dose, initial concentration and contact time, were measured and controlled. The 80% of adsorption was reached, at pH: 5 and 25\u202f\u00b0C, when were used 50\u202fmL of: a 20\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121 of Cr (VI) solution with a dose of 1.25\u202fg of NB, a 30\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121 of Pb (II) solution with a dose of 0.15\u202fg of NB, a 50\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121 Pb (II) solution with a dose of 0.15\u202fg of AB, a 30\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121 Cr (VI) solution with a dose of 0.35\u202fg of AB, a 30\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121 of both metals, with a dose of 0.15\u202fg of AC for Pb (II) and 0.7\u202fg of AC for Cr (VI). In all cases, the pH value before and during the experiments remained constant, indicating the lack of acid/base reactions during the processes. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model best fitted to the experimental data. The experimental results from kinetic studies best correlated using the pseudo-second order model. An increase in the remotion of both ions (Pb (II) and Cr (VI)), was observed when comparing the results obtained using the activated biomass. However, considering the loss of biomass that the pre-treatment causes, the remotion per gram of initial biomass does not vary significantly."}{"Distribution patterns of natural radionuclides and rare earth elements in marine sediments from the Red Sea, Egypt ": "The present study was conducted to study the compositional trends of rare earth elements (REEs), Th, and U in marine sediment samples in terms of distribution patterns, anomalies, and indicator ratios. For this purpose, a total of 32 marine sediment samples were collected from 12 coastal areas of the Egyptian Red Sea and analyzed using instrumental neutron activation (INAA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analytical techniques. The analyses investigated 14 REEs, Th, and U. The results revealed that the contents of REE, light REE (LREE), and heavy REE (HREE) are 47.6, 38.7, and 8.3\u00a0mg/kg, respectively, whereas the concentration of Th and U is determined as 2.15 and 2.23\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. Indicator ratios were calculated, and inter-correlation elements with Th and U were constructed. Multivariate statistics were implemented on the data and GIS technology to construct the distribution patterns of REE, Th, and U along the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea. The obtained results were compared with the corresponding values published in literature to show a good matching. There is a significant enrichment of LREE relative to HREE, a reduced ratio of Th/U, a weak positive anomaly of Eu/Eu*, and a slight positive Ce anomaly is noticed. Among the 12 studied areas, one area, Sharm El-Bahari, located in the middle of the coast, shows peak values of REE, Th, and U relative to the other areas. However, it still shows a good agreement with the results published in the literature."}{"Monte Carlo characterization and benchmarking of extended range REM meters for its application in shielding and radiation area monitoring in Compact Proton Therapy Centers (CPTC) ": "Compact Proton Therapy Centers, CPTC, have a single treatment room, and are technologically more affordable, smaller, advanced and easier to use. From a radiological protection point of view, the leading concern in CPTC are interactions of protons with components of the facility and patients that yield a broad emission of secondary particles, mainly high-energy neutrons, up to 230\u202fMeV, and photons. Optimal design of shielding involves theoretical assumptions in the design phase and, consequently, experimental measurements with extended range neutron detectors must be carried out in the facility during the commissioning period to verify the design, assumptions and building of the enclosures. There are almost 50 CPTC under construction and planning around the world, hence the improvement of methodologies to verify the shielding and to evaluate the dose to workers and general public in CPTC is a trending issue.\n                  The aim of this work was to evaluate and compare the response of two commercial extended range REM meters, WENDI-II and LUPIN-II, for their application in shielding verification and radiation area monitoring in CPTC facilities, by estimating the ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), through the Monte Carlo code MCNP6. The results have been compared with previous works. Likewise, the performance evaluation of these devices in continuous energy neutron field have been carried out, using the AmBe/241 neutron source of the Neutronics Hall (NH) of the Neutron Measurements Laboratory of the Energy Engineering Department of Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (LMN-UPM), through Monte Carlo simulation with the MCNP6 code and experimental measurements.

The first consists of a travelling microscope with unifocal lens, to which a linear distance gauge is attached. The focusing is done by human eye. The second is a modern 3D coordinate measurement machine, equipped with a CMOS colour camera as the sensor. Focusing is performed automatically by software. With both devices, distance measurements of various drop-deposited sources on glass and stainless steel disks have been performed. There is a good mutual agreement of results. Even though the new device can sample more reference points, the accuracy of the measurements has not improved drastically due to the imperfect flatness of the sources. The main advantages of the new system are its ease of use and the lower health risk involved due to the larger distance between the performer and the source."}{"Catalytic oxidation of lignin to valuable biomass-based platform chemicals: A review ": "Lignin is the only sustainable aromatic resource in nature, its utilization has attracted much attention worldwide. Oxidation is one of the promising strategies that can convert lignin to a range of value-added platform chemicals. Lignin oxidation is generally carried out in a liquid phase with employed catalytic systems and oxidants, and this process is largely influenced by operation conditions, catalyst types, presence of oxidant, and solvent species. The inter-unit linkages in lignin can be selectively oxidized with the assistance of designed catalytic systems, facilitating the formation of aromatics (phenolic aldehydes, ketones, and acids), benzoquinones, and aliphatic (di)carboxylic acids. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review on traditional and advanced lignin oxidation concerning various catalytic systems for different terminal products. Deficiency in current lignin oxidation is also mentioned which indicates the direction of further lignin oxidative valorization."}{"Hydrotreatment of pyrolytic lignins to aromatics and phenolics using heterogeneous catalysts ": "The pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass generates a liquid product, known as pyrolysis oil, that can be further processed into biofuels and value-added chemicals. During pyrolysis, cellulose and hemicelulose fractions are converted into a range of water-soluble sugar derivatives, for which several valorisation strategies exist. On the other hand, lignin is broken down into so-called pyrolytic lignin, a water-insoluble complex mixture of aromatic oligomers that requires different upgrading strategies than the sugar rich fraction. Here, we report an experimental study on the valorisation of pyrolytic lignin via catalytic hydrotreatment in the absence of an external solvent. A variety of carbon-supported noble-metal heterogeneous catalysts were tested (Ru/C, Pd/C, Pt/C and Rh/C), as well as conventional hydrotreatment catalysts (sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3) to obtain valuable low molecular weight aromatic and phenolic compounds. Overall, depolymerized liquids were obtained with organic yields of up to 63\u202fwt%. Pd/C was shown to be the best catalyst, yielding 59\u202fwt% of monomers based on the organic product (i.e. 33\u202fwt% based on pyrolytic lignin intake). While noble metal catalysts favored higher monomer yields, though with some over-reduction of aromatic rings to saturated hydrocarbons, sulphided catalysts were more efficient in deoxygenation and aromatization reactions, but yielded less monomers. The hydrocracking efficiency was shown to be strongly dependent on the reaction temperature. Based on the experimental data, a global reaction network is proposed. The high monomer yields reveal the potential of catalytic hydrotreatment for the upgrading of pyrolytic lignin into valuable phenolics and aromatics."}{"Microalgae biodiesel: A review on oil extraction, fatty acid composition, properties and effect on engine performance and emissions ": "Microalgae are explored as the sustainable source of biodiesel production considering their multi restorative effects on water and air. In spite of rapid growth and high lipid content, production of microalgal biodiesel is energy intensive and costly affair. Efficient oil extraction is one of the major hurdles; which needs special attention for making the microalgae biodiesel production process economical. Current review paper discusses various types of extraction methods starting from conventional organic solvent extraction method to advance methods like microwave irradiation, ultrasound, supercritical fluids and ionic liquids for oil extraction and also the direct transesterification. Modern methods give better yield in comparison to conventional methods. The variation of properties of microalgae biodiesel with respect to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition is also highlighted and the properties are compared against established standards. Also, the previous studies on performance and emission characteristics using microalgae have been reviewed and it is found that microalgae biodiesel is on comparable scale to that of first and second generation biofuel. Lots of research scope and further developments in harvesting, drying, oil extraction and direct transesterification stages can potentially establish microalgae as next generation source for transport fuel production."}{"Extraction techniques in sustainable biofuel production: A concise review ": "The concerns of fossil fuel depletion and environmental issues have increased general interest in studies on the development of sustainable biofuel. In the biofuel production process, the extraction technique is a key technology with respect to energy consumption and product value. In this review, recent advances related to the extraction process in biofuel production are discussed. The major extraction methods were classified as conventional solvent extraction (CSE), physical-supported solvent extraction (PSSE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), and novel extractions. We address each of these classified extraction methods in turn both in relation to the feedstock utilized in the different biofuel generation methods and to the targeted biofuels. Our objective is to provide a concise, timely, and comprehensive review on various extraction methods applied/studied regarding biofuel production, their principles and advantages/limitations, and recent case studies. In particular, the classified extraction methods in the production of third-generation algal biofuel were intensively evaluated. Consequently, the concept of free from drying and cell disruption (FDC) routes was advanced herein as it may possess the potential to reduce the requirement for input energy during the production of algae biofuels."}{"Recent development of production technology of diesel- and jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from inedible biomass ": "Key catalytic processes for the production of diesel-fuel- and jet-fuel-range branched or cyclic alkanes from lignocellulose and microalgal oil are reviewed, in particular the processes for the constructing the carbon framework. Furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 2-methylfuran are the most fundamental building blocks (platform chemicals) in the synthesis of long chain alkanes from lignocellulose. Aldol condensation and alkylation of furan ring are key reactions to elongate the carbon chain. Hydrodeoxygenation follows the carbon chain elongation, giving final alkane product. Effective hydrodeoxygenation catalysts include Pd/NbOPO4, Ir-ReOx/SiO2 and Ni/zeolites. Pd/NbOPO4 catalyst is effective to convert furanic precursor with oxygen-containing chains. Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalyst is attractive in view of the high activity (low reaction temperature), and Ni/zeolites are attractive in view of the catalyst cost. Lignin or raw lignocellulose can be converted to mixture of alkanes including diesel-fuel- and jet-fuel-range ones using catalytic cracking, alkylation and hydrogenation. Microalgal large hydrocarbons can be converted to smaller alkanes with retention of branches in the carbon chain by Ru/CeO2-catalyzed CC hydrogenolysis."}{"Hydrotreatment of pyrolysis bio-oil: A review ": "Fast pyrolysis converts >60\u202fwt% of lignocellulosic materials into bio-oil.

In the first step, known as stabilization, the carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups are transformed into alcohols between 373 and 573\u202fK, in the presence of noble metals (Pt, Ru and Pd) supported on carbon and metal oxides. In the second step, between 623 and 673\u202fK, cracking and hydro-deoxygenation occur using Ru, Ni or sulfided CoMo catalysts. Transition metal phosphides and carbides are also active. The first section is devoted to summarizing the current understanding of bio-oil composition. The second section is an overview of bio-oil hydrotreatment processing parameters. Many of the bio-oil hydrotreatment studies in the literature are based on model compound results, which are reviewed in the third section. Section four is devoted to review studies with bio-oil fractions and the nature of polymerization and cross linked reactions responsible for catalyst deactivation. The progress in the development of new catalysts is discussed in section five. The review ends with a discussion on future prospects and challenges to hydrotreat pyrolysis bio-oils."}{"Catalytic furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol over Cu/SiO2 catalysts: A comparative study of the preparation methods ": "Furfuryl alcohol, a vital intermediate for the production of foundry resins, fragrances, pharmaceuticals and pesticide, is produced by hydrogenation of furfural in gas phase or liquid phase. The furfuryl alcohol production in gas phase over silica supported copper catalyst is favored thanks to the environmental and technical advantages. The effect of preparation methods of silica supported copper catalysts on the structure and performance was investigated by means of ICP, N2 physisorption, ex-situ/in-situ XRD, in-situ XPS, FT-IR, H2-TPR, TEM, N2O titration, TG as well as furfural hydrogenation. The results indicated that the different catalyst synthesis strategies led to the diverse copper species in the calcined samples and disparate Cu0 surface area as well as different molar ratio of Cu+/(Cu+\u202f+\u202fCu0) in the fresh samples. The performance of impregnation derived sample was poorer than that of commercial CuCr-Strem catalyst. The catalysts prepared by deposition precipitation and ion exchange exhibited similar performance to the CuCr-Strem. The ammonia evaporation derived catalyst (Cu/SiO2-EA) showed superior performance in the activity, selectivity and stability among all the studied catalysts. The excellent performance was related to the highest surface area of Cu0, smallest copper particle size, large surface area and pore volume as well as appropriate higher Cu+/(Cu+\u202f+\u202fCu0) ratio. Furthermore, all the copper catalysts went through deactivation, which was caused by carbon deposition, during the reaction. Owing to the largest amount of Cu0 sites and large SBET, the Cu/SiO2-EA exhibited the slowest deactivation rate."}{"Reusing, recycling and up-cycling of biomass: A review of practical and kinetic modelling approaches ": "There is a growing interest in the utilisation of biomass for a range of applications. Coupled with this is the appeal of improving the circular economy and as such, there is a focus on reusing, recycling and upcycling of many materials, including biomass. This has been driven by society in terms of demand for more sustainable energy and products, but also by a paradigm shift in attitudes of the population to reduce their personal carbon footprint. Herein we have selected a number of types of biomass (woody, herbaceous, etc.) and surveyed the ways in which they are utilised. We have done this in combination with assessing some kinetic modelling approaches which been reported for the evaluation of different processes for the recycling, reuse and upcycling of biomass."}{"Preparation and reactivity of hierarchical catalysts in catalytic cracking ": "The objective of this review is to describe recent advances in preparation and reactivity of hierarchical catalysts for catalytic cracking of carbonaceous materials consisting of not only simple straight-chained and substituted aromatic hydrocarbons but also heavy molecules such as vacuum gas oil, atmospheric residue and biomass like vegetable oil. Catalysts for catalytic cracking are mainly composed of matrix and zeolite. It has been well-known that, since the content of zeolite is usually smaller than that of matrix, zeolite is approximately surrounded by matrix particles. This means that the catalysts of catalytic cracking forms a hierarchical structure even if major component of matrix would be kaolin which has not significant pores. Zeolite has micropores and very high activity for cracking while kaolin does not have the activity for cracking but the catalysts have the very large size and wide range of pores from micropores to mesopores and macropores which promote the diffusion of not only reactants but also products. Preparation, characterization and reactivity of zeolite with the high catalytic activity have extensively been reported, however it has not necessarily been clarified for a long time how the amounts and the sizes of pores in matrix affect the reactivity in catalytic cracking. Recent advances in preparation methods of not only zeolite but also mesoporous materials are remarkable and the advantages of hierarchical structure in catalysts for catalytic cracking have extensively been reported. These include novel mesoporous zeolites, the combination of zeolite and advanced mesoporous materials, and zeolite surrounded by mesoporous materials, which increased the activity and the selectivity for products in catalytic cracking. The review describes how the hierarchical catalysts are made, how the hierarchical structure act for the reaction and what are the roles of matrix and zeolite in detail."}{"Recent progress in the preparation, properties and applications of superhydrophobic nano-based coatings and surfaces: A review ": "With the recent progress in nanotechnology and material engineering, nano-based coatings have become multifunctional, smarter, efficient, versatile and durable.

In this perspective article, various fundamental aspects of wettability and related phenomena are discussed. We present and compare the existing methods for the preparation of superhydrophobic coatings.

Insecticides represent an effective way to control pest insects but are harmful to the environment. As an eco-friendlier alternative, we have formulated waterborne, organic paints which provided a slippery physical barrier for leafcutter ants (Atta cephalotes) on vertical surfaces. Different paints were produced by varying the Pigment Volume Concentration (PVC) and amount of TiO2 and CaCO3 particles, and characterised in terms of contact angles, surface roughness and scrub resistance. The paints\u2019 slipperiness for A. cephalotes ants was evaluated in climbing tests on vertical paint panels (by recording the percentage of fallen ants). Two main factors reduced the insects\u2019 attachment to vertical paint surfaces: (1) the PVC: in paints above a critical PVC, more loose particles detach from the coating and thereby reduce insect attachment; and (2) the type, dimensions and shape of solid particles: CaCO3 particles detach more easily from the paint than TiO2, probably due to their larger size and platelet shape. Paints formulated at PVC 70 and containing 20\u202fwt% CaCO3 showed the best performance in terms of slipperiness, as well as providing good scrub resistance."}{"Role of graphene oxide and functionalized graphene oxide in protective hybrid coatings ": "This work evaluates the performance of hybrid coatings of polyurethane/polysiloxane filled with graphene oxide as replacement of chromate conversion coatings for protection of 2024-T3 aluminum alloys. The polysiloxanes in the hybrid coating form strong covalent bonds with the metal surfaces and inhibit corrosion, polyurethanes provide mechanical and optical properties, and graphene oxide and isocyanate-treated graphene oxide particles reduce oxygen and moisture diffusion through the coatings. The corrosion performance evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and filiform corrosion test indicates the following trends. The hybrid coatings filled with isocyanate-treated graphene oxide particles show lower resistance to corrosion compared to hybrid coatings without graphene oxide, although oxygen diffusion and water vapor transmission are reduced by respectively 50% and 10% in the presence of only 0.67\u202fwt.% graphene oxide. It is revealed that graphene oxide and isocyanate-treated graphene oxide particles promote polysiloxane condensation on particle surfaces, thereby effectively reducing a part of polysiloxanes that form continuous corrosion-protective layers on the aluminum alloy surface."}{"Graphene-based polymer nanocomposites as barrier coatings for corrosion protection ": "Graphene has attracted various academic and industrial interest due to its unique electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties. The exceptional lamellar structure of graphene and its derivatives have been identified as anti-corrosive additives in the formulation of polymeric coatings.

Armed with nanotechnology, it is possible to design advanced epoxy-based coatings for engineering uses. Nevertheless, the interplay among curing, properties, and performance of epoxy coatings should be meticulously understood to guarantee a high efficiency. In this respect, viscosity-induced curing accompanied by gelation and vitrification phenomena makes judgment about the efficiency of nanostructured epoxy coatings very difficult.

The traditional SLIPS fabricated based on capillary effect of micro-structure was prone to be damaged in practical application. To solve this problem, a slippery organogel layer (OG) was designed by infusing silicone oil into poly(dimethylsiloxane) based polyurea (PDMS-PUa) synthesized from \u03b1, \u03c9-Aminopropyl terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (APT-PDMS) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). The self-healing property of the substrate was attributed to the breaking and reforming of hydrogen bonding in urea groups between PDMS-PUa, and self-generating of the lubricant oil layer was based on infiltration of silicone oil through PDMS-PUa substrate to the damaged area. The as-fabricated OG exhibited slippery performance with a low water sliding angle of <10\u02da. The fractured substrates could self-heal after contacting at room temperature for 48\u2009h, and the self-healing efficiency of the substrates increased with temperature. In addition, the as-prepared OG exhibited excellent performance in inhibiting bacterial settlement compared with bare glass (BG) and PDMS-PUa verified by bacterial settlement experiment under both static and dynamic environments. The as-prepared OG will provide an alternative strategy to design self-healing marine anti-fouling coatings in practical application."}{"Study on waterborne acrylate coatings modified with biomass silicon ": "Silica that originated from the calcination of rice husks, which is a source of biomass silicon, was added as a reinforcing agent to waterborne polyacrylate wood coatings to improve their coating performance, and especially their mechanical properties.

However, conventional Fenton oxidation possesses some drawbacks such as the requirement of acidic pH condition, production of iron sludge and requirement of high chemical inputs. Strategies such as heterogeneous Fenton, fluidized bed Fenton, use of chelating agents and in-situ production of Fenton\u2019s reagent have been studied as possible solutions to these limitations. Although there have been reviews on the fundamentals and applications of Fenton oxidation, a review with focus on the limitations of Fenton oxidation and their possible solutions is lacking. Here, we review the limitations of Fenton oxidation and the recent strategies toward addressing them. For each approach, fundamentals and applications in the removal of recalcitrant pollutants are reviewed. Heterogeneous Fenton process is the most widely investigated due to the progress in catalysis. Fluidized bed Fenton process could lower sludge generation and enhance process performance. Chelating agents are used to conduct homogeneous Fenton at circumneutral pH, though the potential detrimental effect of some chelating agents remains a source of concern. In situ production of Fenton\u2019s reagent through bioelectrochemical technology (bioelectro-Fenton) is emerging as a possible strategy to reduce the cost associated with Fenton\u2019s reagent."}{"Promising prospects of nanomaterials for arsenic water remediation: A comprehensive review ": "This review discusses the brief of health problem associated with the arsenic exposure found in drinking water.

Phase change materials (PCMs), due to their unique thermo-physical properties, have been exploited in different designs of solar collectors to maximize the useful heat gained by collectors. Moreover, adding nanoparticles to PCMs to produce nanocomposite (NC) PCMs with superior thermo-physical properties added new advantages to the applications of these materials in solar collector applications.

Traditional fire detection was done by operators through video cameras in petroleum and chemical facilities. However, it is an unrealistic job for the operator in a large chemical facility to find out the fire in time because there may be hundreds of video cameras installed and the operator may have multiple tasks during his/her shift. With the rapid development of computer vision, intelligent fire detection has received extensive attention from academia and industry. In this paper, we present a novel intelligent fire detection approach through video cameras for preventing fire hazards from going out of control in chemical factories and other high-fire-risk industries. The approach includes three steps: motion detection, fire detection and region classification. At first, moving objects are detected through cameras by a background subtraction method. Then the frame with moving objects is determined by a fire detection model which can output fire regions and their locations. Since false fire regions (some objects similar with fire) may be generated, a region classification model is used to identify whether it is a fire region or not. Once fire appears in any camera, the approach can detect it and output the coordinates of the fire region. Simultaneously, instant messages will be immediately sent to safety supervisors as a fire alarm. The approach can meet the needs of real-time fire detection on the precision and the speed. Its industrial deployment will help detect fire at the very early stage, facilitate the emergency management and therefore significantly contribute to loss prevention."}{"Modeling and optimization of heterogeneous Fenton-like and photo-Fenton processes using reusable Fe3O4-MWCNTs ": "In this work, iron (II, III) oxide (Fe3O4) was synthesized and incorporated onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to prepare Fe3O4-MWCNTs composite in a quest for evaluating its performance and reusability in both Fenton-like and photo-Fenton processes. The characterization of Fe3O4-MWCNTs by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy showed that the prepared catalyst can behave as a composite. Methylene blue (MB) was used as a substrate for evaluation of Fenton-like and photo-Fenton processes. The reusability of the catalyst and the influence of operation parameters such as pH, H2O2 dosage, and catalyst loading were investigated. Complete degradation of MB was attained by Fe3O4-MWCNTs in the aforementioned processes, whereas the removal efficiency of MB by using bare MWCNTs under the same conditions was 52%, which suggests that the generated oxidant species due to the reactions between H2O2 and leached iron contribute to the degradation of MB. A degradation pathway was proposed based on the oxidation intermediates that have been detected by mass spectrometry. The reusability of Fe3O4-MWCNTs has been examined in four consecutive cycles. The final removal of MB in the fourth cycle was 94%. The optimization of MB removal was investigated by response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD). Moreover, an artificial neural network (ANN) of type feed-forward back propagation was employed to model the influence of operating conditions.

The samples exhibited porous structure, low density of 6.99mg/cm3, good thermostability, excellent hydrophobicity with water contact angle of 146\u00b0. The properties of graphene aerogel have been significantly improved by introducing grass powder, leading to highly efficient selective adsorption. The adsorption capacity of GGA ranged from 68.40 to 145.84g/g for various liquid solvents, which is superior to that of unmodified graphene aerogel (GA). Moreover, GGA can be regenerated by repeated heat treatment and its adsorption capacity maintaining at above 90% of initial value after regeneration. GGA can realize oil-water separation of mixed solution by different manipulation methods. On one hand, GGA removed little oils in water through adsorption. On the other hand, GGA can act as filter media dealing with oil-water mixtures and collecting oils continuously by gravity or peristaltic pump. Good selectivity, high adsorption capacities and satisfactory recoverability make it possible to become a potential candidate in the field of oil-water separation and spill oil cleanup to realize environmental remediation.

It is crucial to develop a quick response strategy, including the accurate prediction of oil and gas migration path, oil droplet size distribution and other parameters. Volume of fluid (VOF) model and realizable k-\u03b5 turbulence model are employed to investigate the underwater spreading characteristics and migration law of oil leakage. Influencing factors such as wave length, leakage direction, current speed, wind speed, oil density, and leaking rate are analyzed by numerical simulation. The calculation results indicates that wave length affects both the underwater spread and drift process, while current speed and wind speed mainly influence the drift process. Leakage direction, oil density and leaking rate have significant influence on underwater spread process but limited effect on drift process. A formula is proposed to predict the oil diffusion distance at certain time. The results of investigation can offer a valuable guidance for formulation of emergency response."}{"Fetal methotrexate syndrome: A systematic review of case reports ": "Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist known to be teratogenic in humans. Several cases of congenital malformations after fetal exposure to methotrexate have been published, resulting in the establishment of the \u2018fetal methotrexate syndrome\u2019. However, it is unclear which congenital anomalies can truly be attributed to methotrexate exposure. The objective of this review is to delineate a consistent phenotype of the fetal methotrexate syndrome. We performed a systematic review that yielded 29 cases of (congenital) anomalies after in utero exposure to methotrexate and compared their malformation pattern to that of children and fetuses with congenital anomalies in general. Statistically significant higher proportions of microcephaly, craniosynostosis, tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary valve atresia, limb reduction defects and syndactyly were found in the methotrexate group, indicating that these congenital anomalies are truly part of the fetal methotrexate syndrome. These results aid clinicians with diagnosing fetal methotrexate syndrome."}{"A multi-institutional study benchmarking the zebrafish developmental assay for prediction of embryotoxic plasma concentrations from rat embryo\u2013fetal development studies ": "Predicting embryotoxicity of pharmaceutical compounds or industrial chemicals is crucial for public safety. Conventional studies which monitor embryo\u2013fetal development in rats and rabbits are costly and time consuming. Alternative assays which are simpler and less costly are being pursued. The purpose of this research was to assess the capacity for the zebrafish development assay to predict mammalian plasma levels that are embryotoxic. Previously published data on rat plasma levels associated with embryotoxicity were used to guide concentration ranges for each of 25 chemicals dissolved in the media bathing developing zebrafish embryos. Embryotoxic media concentrations were compared to embryotoxic rat plasma concentrations. Assays were conducted in parallel at multiple sites as a consortium effort through the Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI). Considering results from all sites, the zebrafish embryo development assay predicted (within 1-log) the rat maternal exposure levels associated with embryotoxicity 75% of the time."}{"Comparison of immune system development in nonclinical species and humans: Closing information gaps for immunotoxicity testing and human translatability ": ""}{"Heightened susceptibility: A review of how pregnancy and chemical exposures influence maternal health ": "Pregnancy is a unique period when biological changes can increase sensitivity to chemical exposures. Pregnant women are exposed to multiple environmental chemicals via air, food, water, and consumer products, including flame retardants, plasticizers, and pesticides. Lead exposure increases risk of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders, although women\u2019s health risks are poorly characterized for most chemicals. Research on prenatal exposures has focused on fetal outcomes and less on maternal outcomes. We reviewed epidemiologic literature on chemical exposures during pregnancy and three maternal outcomes: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and breast cancer. We found that pregnancy can heighten susceptibility to environmental chemicals and women\u2019s health risks, although variations in study design and exposure assessment limited study comparability. Future research should include pregnancy as a critical period for women\u2019s health. Incorporating biomarkers of exposure and effect, deliberate timing and method of measurement, and consistent adjustment of potential confounders would strengthen research on the exposome and women\u2019s health."}{"Assessment of medication use during pregnancy by Web-based questionnaires, pharmacy records and serum screening ": "Objective\n                  To compare assessment of early pregnancy medication exposure using three methods of data collection.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Serum samples were obtained from 752 women participating in the PRegnancy and Infant DEvelopment (PRIDE) Study before gestational week 17.

Herein, ToxRefDB version 2.0 (ToxRefDBv2) development is described. Endpoints were annotated (e.g. required, not required) according to guidelines for subacute, subchronic, chronic, developmental, and multigenerational reproductive designs, distinguishing negative responses from untested. Quantitative data were extracted, and dose-response modeling for nearly 28,000 datasets from nearly 400 endpoints using Benchmark Dose (BMD) Modeling Software were generated and stored. Implementation of controlled vocabulary improved data quality; standardization to guideline requirements and cross-referencing with United Medical Language System (UMLS) connects ToxRefDBv2 observations to vocabularies linked to UMLS, including PubMed medical subject headings. ToxRefDBv2 allows for increased connections to other resources and has greatly enhanced quantitative and qualitative utility for predictive toxicology."}{"Update of the DevTox data database for harmonized risk assessment and alternative methodologies in developmental toxicology: Report of the 9th Berlin Workshop on Developmental Toxicity ": "Representatives of applied science (e.g. governmental organizations, academia, and industry) met to discuss the progress towards a harmonized human health risk assessment in developmental toxicology of plant protection products, biocidal products, and other environmental chemicals at the 9th Berlin Workshop on Developmental Toxicity held in September 2018. Within the focus of the scientific discussion were the future of in-vitro methods for developmental and reproductive toxicology, the potential relevance of alternative species in testing of developmental effects, and risk and hazard assessment of developmental and endocrine effects.\n                  Furthermore, the need for a harmonized terminology for classification of anomalies in laboratory animals in developmental toxicity studies aiming for human health risk assessment was determined. Here, the DevTox database was identified as an extremely valuable tool. Overall, the participants agreed that still one of the biggest challenges for testing developmental toxicity in the 21st century is the development of animal-free test strategies and alternatives to animal testing that could provide human-relevant information in a rapid, efficient, and mechanistically informative manner."}{"Marijuana-derived cannabinoids inhibit uterine endometrial stromal cell decidualization and compromise trophoblast-endometrium cross-talk ": "Marijuana (cannabis) use by pregnant women in the United States is increasing and there is a dire need to understand the beneficial or harmful effects of cannabis during pregnancy. Uterine endometrial stromal cells are fibroblast-like cells that differentiate into secretory cells, a process called decidualization, to create a microenvironment conducive for placenta formation and early embryonic growth. In this study, using model human cell lines, we for the first time demonstrate that \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN) inhibit endometrial stromal cell decidualization and have adverse effects on trophoblast-endometrium cross-talk."}{"Computing solubility parameters of deep eutectic solvents from Molecular Dynamics simulations ": "The solubility parameter (SP) of a solvent is a key property that measures the polarity and quantifies the \u2018like-dissolves-like\u2019 principle, which is an important rule in chemistry for screening solvents for separation processes. It is challenging to experimentally obtain solubility parameters of non-volatile solvents like ionic liquids (ILs), deep eutectic solvents (DESs), and polymers. Here, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to compute the Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameters of DESs, which are green solvents with potential applications in many different fields. The results from MD simulations are compared with limited available experimental data and commonly used SP correlations for non-volatile solvents. Very limited information is available in literature for the vapor phase composition of DESs. Solubility parameters are computed based on the vaporization of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) components of the DESs as well as clusters, consisting of HBD and HBA components. The relatively large SPs computed from MD indicate that the investigated choline chloride-based DESs are polar solvents. The values of SPs are not significantly affected by temperature. A comparison of vaporization enthalpies of HBD, HBA and clusters from the DES mixture suggests that it is more likely for HBD molecules to vaporize from the DES mixture and dominate the vapor phase."}{"Recovery of lithium from alkaline brine by solvent extraction with functionalized ionic liquid ": "Lithium recovery from alkaline brine was carried out by solvent extraction (SX) using a hydroxyl-functionalized ionic liquid, 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methyl imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([OHEMIM][NTf2]) and a neutral ligand, trialkyl phosphine oxide (Cyanex923) as the extractants. Effect of extraction parameters, i.e. concentration of ionic liquid, extraction time, pH value of aqueous phase, phase ratio and mole ratio of sodium to lithium, on lithium extraction efficiency have been studied. Under the optimal parameters, over 93% of lithium was extracted in one single run. The extraction mechanism of lithium was investigated by the combination method of experiment and UV\u2013visible spectroscopic characterization, and it was found that the ion exchange predominated during the extraction process. The extraction complex was determined by a slope analysis method, indicating that Cyanex923, Li+ and [NTf2]- formed a 2:1:1 complex. The thermodynamic study indicated that lithium extraction reaction was spontaneous. Based on the above results, [OHEMIM][NTf2]-Cyanex923 extraction system showed a promising application in the recovery of lithium from alkaline brine."}{"Using COSMO-RS to design choline chloride pharmaceutical eutectic solvents ": "Deep eutectic solvents (DES) present interesting properties, mostly connected to their solvation ability, and have been subject to much research in the recent past. Currently, the discovery of new eutectic solvents is accomplished by experimentally measuring the eutectic point of random systems, often using choline chloride as a hydrogen bond acceptor. In this work, the eutectic temperatures of new choline chloride-based eutectic systems were experimentally assessed. These data, along with other previously reported in the literature, were used to evaluate a method based on COSMO-RS to predict the eutectic temperature of choline-chloride based mixtures. The predictive methodology herein developed allows for the quick scanning of a large matrix of systems in order to identify those more promising to be in the liquid state at a given temperature. To validate this method, the eutectic temperature of pharmaceutical drug mixtures was predicted and, then, assessed experimentally, showing that COSMO-RS is useful in the design of liquid drug-based formulations."}{"Solubility of passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims) seed oil in supercritical CO2\n             ": "Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of crude oil from vegetable by-products have gained attention since they enhance the recovery of bioactive compounds with potential application in food and cosmetics with the utilization of a green solvent, CO2. Crude passion fruit seed oil (CPFO) obtained from by-products is a rich source of bioactive compounds. However, phase equilibrium data of this vegetable oil are scarce in the literature. This work obtained phase equilibrium data of CPFO in supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) using two methods: dynamic and static synthetic. Experimental pressures were 20, 22.5 and 25\u202fMPa and temperatures were 313, 323 and 333\u202fK. Moreover, a literature review has been made to compare CPFO solubility with the reported solubilities of some pure bioactive compounds of interest. The pressure of 25\u202fMPa provided the highest oil solubility for all evaluated temperatures (313\u2013333\u202fK), and the crossover phenomenon was observed at temperatures above 323\u202fK. The findings of this work also indicate that fatty acid composition is mostly related to oil solubility than to minor compounds present in CPFO."}{"Thermodynamic properties of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents and solubility of water and HMF in them: Measurements and PC-SAFT modeling ": "Recently, hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were proposed as interesting solvents for biorefinery processes, such as the production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from glucose in an aqueous environment. Physicochemical property data of hydrophobic DES\u00a0+\u00a0water/HMF systems are of utmost importance for process design. In this work, density and vapor pressure of eight different hydrophobic DESs, as well as water solubility and HMF solubility in these DESs were experimentally determined. The solubility was modeled using the pseudo-pure component approach within the framework of Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT). New pure-component parameters for the eight hydrophobic DESs were obtained by fitting to measured density and vapor-pressure data, instead of to density data only. Based on these new pure-component parameters for the DESs, the solubilities of water and of HMF in the hydrophobic DESs were modeled in good agreement with the experimental data at 298\u00a0K and atmospheric pressure."}{"A novel pore-size-dependent equation of state for modeling fluid phase behavior in nanopores ": "The thermodynamic behavior of fluids confined in nanopores differs from that of bulk fluid by the fluid-pore wall interaction. Inspired by the heterogeneous distribution and layering transitions from fluid-wall interactions, we have developed a pore-size-dependent equation of state (EOS) extended from the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) by describing the confined fluid as distinct populations of surface-adsorbed and core fluid. The surface-adsorbed fluid physically corresponds to two surface-adsorbed layers and is therefore considered to interact with the pore wall through a dual-square-well (DSW) potential function. The presented EOS requires only one additional parameter of confinement energy (\u03b5\n                     \n                        sf\n                     ) beyond PR EOS, and it needs to be determined from experimental data. Using adsorption and differential scanning calorimetry experiments, we determine the confinement parameter \u03b5\n                     \n                        sf\n                      for nitrogen, carbon dioxide, n-alkanes of methane to n-tetradecane, with respect to surfaces of native silica and silylated silica. The resulting database of confinement parameters is presented. This EOS models adsorption isotherms, phase transition temperature, and phase transition-pore size relations, in agreement with experimental data. The EOS is shown to be a unified tool for modeling the fluid phase behavior in nanopores."}{"Thermophysical characterization of the deep eutectic solvent choline chloride:ethylene glycol and one of its mixtures with water ": "The deep eutectic solvent ethaline, containing choline chloride as H-bond acceptor and ethylene glycol as H-bond donor and one of its mixture with water are studied in this work. Ethaline is anhydrous, with a 1:2\u202fmol ratio. Hydrated ethaline, choline chloride:ethylene glycol:water, was studied in a 1:1.98:0.95\u202fmol ratio. Several volumetric, acoustic, optical, thermal, surface, and transport properties were measured and calculated. The working temperature ranges from 278.15 to 338.15\u202fK\u202fat pressure\u202f=\u202f0.1\u202fMPa. The effects of temperature, water inclusion, and the nature of the donor compound are evaluated. With regard to temperature, the system's behaviour is as expected: a linear relation for the thermodynamic properties and agreement with the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation for the transport properties. The water molecules hardly modify the ethaline structure. The choline chloride \u2013 ethylene glycol interactions are weaker than those for choline chloride - glycerol."}{"Influence of temperature, water content and type of organic acid on the formation, stability and properties of functional natural deep eutectic solvents ": "Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) have received considerable attention of biochemical and food industry due to their low toxicity and cost, remarkable solubilisation ability, negligible volatility at room temperature and good selectivity. In this sense, the purpose of this work was to synthesize various NADES based on several natural components (lactic acid (La), glucose (G), choline chloride (C) and citric acid (Ca)). In order to direct future applications, the NADES were characterized with respect to their physical (density), rheological, surface and thermal properties. The influence of temperature, type of organic acid, and water content in each of these systems were also evaluated. The samples were compared in two groups: with and without water (W) (LaGW(5:1:3) and LaG(5:1)), and with different organic acids (CLa(1:1) and CCaW(1:1:1)). Viscosity and density were inversely affected by the temperature for all samples; the water content in the LaG(5:1) and LaGW(5:1:3) samples resulted in differences in viscosity. Density values ranged from 1.13\u202fg\u202fmL\u22121 (CLa(1:1) at 323\u202fK) to 1.30\u202fg\u202fmL\u22121 (CCaW(1:1:1) at 293\u202fK). There was no significant difference between LaG(5:1) and LaGW(5:1:3), but there was a significant difference between CLa(1:1) and CCaW(1:1:1). The Ostwald-de-Waele rheological model indicated that only CCaW(1:1:1) presented a distinct change in rheological behaviour in response to an increase in temperature: it presented Newtonian behaviour at 298\u202fK and pseudoplastic behaviour at 333\u202fK. The Arrhenius model showed a good fit for the effect of temperature on the apparent viscosity of all NADESs. The apparent viscosities of the NADESs were compared to the surface tension and were directly proportional: the surface tension increased with an increase in viscosity. The thermal characterisation revealed a glass transition for NADES LaG(5:1), LaGW(5:1:3) and CCaW(1:1:1) at temperatures below 220.03\u202fK, confirming their formation and stability. Based on the results, the proposed NADES may be expected to be potential green solvents in the diverse fields of food, pharmaceuticals and chemistry technology."}{"Effect of alkyl chain length on the wetting behavior of imidazolium based ionic liquids: A molecular dynamics study ": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to investigate the wetting behavior of imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs), which mainly consist of an imidazolium ring with a flexible alkyl chain attachment. The length of the alkyl chain can be easily manipulated to modulate the wetting properties of the ILs. To understand the role of the alkyl chain, we investigate the wetting behavior of two room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), 1,3-dimethylimidazolium tetra-fluoroborate [DMIM][BF4] and 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium tetra-fluoroborate [PrMIM][BF4], on a graphite surface. Furthermore, the effects of the droplet size and temperature on the contact angle of the IL droplets are investigated. The wetting behaviors of both IL droplets are characterized using a density profile and orientation order parameter profile along the axis normal to the surface. The length of the alkyl chain is found to be crucial for modulating the wetting properties of the ILs. With an increase in the length of the alkyl chain, the contact angle of the droplet decreases, which is also in line with experimental results [1,2]. The wetting of the IL droplets strongly depends on the temperature and the relative fluid-fluid and fluid-substrate interactions. With the increase in temperature, the contact angle of the IL droplet decreases, resulting in the formation of a single layer film at a high temperature. In addition, the behavior of the contact angle of the IL droplet is analyzed through the surface tension as well as the graphite-IL interfacial tension. Furthermore, considering the anisotropic properties of the imidazolium-based ILs, we calculate the contact angles for cylindrical filaments (2D) on the graphite surface and compare the obtained values with the contact angle obtained from the spherical droplet (3D). The contact angle of the cylindrical droplet is found to have a negligible system size effect as compared to the case with the spherical droplet."}{"Calculation of viscosities of branched alkanes from 0.1 to 1000 MPa by molecular dynamics methods using COMPASS force field ": "Shear viscosity is one of the key subjects of molecular modeling studies since this quality is used in the development of lubricants. In this paper, we use molecular dynamics methods to predict viscosity dependence on pressure up to 1000 MPa for 2,2,4-trimethylhexane. The COMPASS class II force field is used to determine atomic interactions in the model. The shear viscosity is calculated using Green-Kubo and M\u00fcller-Plathe methods. To achieve the convergence of the Green-Kubo integral, the time decomposition method is used. The approach is validated by 2,2,4-trimethylpentane for which experimental data are available. The calculated 2,2,4-trimethylhexane viscosity coefficient dependence is fit by Tait-like equation and does not show super-Arrhenius behavior. The Tait fit matches the experiment produced by Scott Bair for the pressures up to 500 MPa within the accuracy of the methods."}{"Phase behavior of hydrocarbons in nano-pores ": "Inside nanopores, solid-fluid interactions are of the same order of magnitude as intermolecular interactions of fluid molecules. This fact strongly modifies the thermodynamic properties of confined fluids with respect to bulk phases. Tight oil and shale gas reservoirs, where the proportion of micro (below 2\u202fnm) and mesopores (between 2 and 50\u202fnm) can reach more than 20% of the volume distribution, represent an environment with such problems and industrial challenges to hydrocarbon fluid pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) modeling. This study provides a detailed understanding of the thermodynamic behavior of confined fluid and reference data of the thermodynamic properties of pure components (methane, ethane, n-pentane, n-decane) and mixtures (methane/ethane, ethane/n-pentane) confined in graphite slit pores. Furthermore, a detailed explanation of the different pressures considered in a porous medium with nano-pores is given. The Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) NVT simulation is used for pure components instead of the more traditional Grand Canonical Monte Carlo ensemble (GCMC) simulation to get more precise results of liquid and vapor confined pressure avoiding the phase change location determination problem. The evolution of critical temperature and pressure versus pore radius is compared to literature correlations and confined vapor and liquid densities are calculated. A new and robust method in the GEMC ensemble called GEMC NPT Bubble point Monte Carlo (BPMC) completed with GEMC NVT simulations has been developed to get thermodynamic properties including pressures at equilibrium of confined mixtures. Pressure versus density diagrams, pressure versus molar fraction isotherms and examples of pressure versus temperature diagram for a specific composition are built. The phase envelope of the confined fluid is shifted and closes with respect to phase envelope of bulk fluid. The critical temperature and pressure are shifted from the bulk value to a lower value and the bubble point pressure is decreased as the dew point pressure is increased. With regards to the selectivity of the confined system compared to the bulk fluid, for the methane/ethane and ethane/n-pentane mixtures, the heavier component is preferentially adsorbed in the vapor phase and the lighter component is preferentially adsorbed in the liquid phase. All these results for pure components and mixtures provide relevant information concerning the understanding of the phase behavior in confined systems such as shale gas and tight oil reservoirs, emphasizing the difference from the bulk fluid. Furthermore all these data may be used as references for pore radius dependent equation of state (EOS) calibration."}{"Vapor-liquid (azeotropic systems) and liquid-liquid equilibrium calculations using UNIFAC and NRTL-SAC activity coefficient models ": "The aim of present study was to investigate some of the most important maximum and minimum azeotrope boiling temperature systems using UNIFAC and NRTL-SAC models as the predictive models. Also, the predictive power of UNIFAC, UNIFAC-LLE and NRTL-SAC models were compared in liquid-liquid equilibrium calculations. For maximum azeotrope temperature systems, except for formic acid-water, the UNIFAC model had higher degree of accuracy than the NRTL-SAC model. The NRTL-SAC model could not appropriately predict the maximum azeotrope temperature systems, in particular for acetone-chloroform, chloroform-methyl acetate, and chloroform-diethyl amine systems. For these systems, the NRTL-SAC model gave a minimum azeotrope temperature. For the examined minimum azeotrope boiling temperature systems, the results of both models were in consistent with the experimental data, but in most cases, the results of the UNIFAC model were in good agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, as the pressure deviated from 101.3\u202fkPa, the deviation of both models increased. In the case of ternary VLE systems under study, UNIFAC model indicated better results than NRTL-SAC model. Totally, in most VLE systems, UNIFAC was much better than NRTL-SAC and we preferred UNIFAC model as a good candidate for VLE calculations of the studied systems. Based on the overall deviation of models for LLE calculations at all temperatures, the best representation of the system was in the following order: UNIFAC-LLE\u202f>\u202fUNIFAC\u202f>\u202fNRTL-SAC. There would appear to be a major difficulty in selecting one thermodynamic model as the best, as the choice might be system-dependent."}{"Benthic-pelagic coupling in coastal seas \u2013 Modelling macrofaunal biomass and carbon processing in response to organic matter supply ": "Benthic macrofauna is an important component linking pelagic and benthic ecosystems, especially in productive coastal areas. Through their metabolism and behaviour, benthic animals affect biogeochemical fluxes between the sediment and water column. Mechanistic models that quantify these benthic-pelagic links are imperative to understand the functioning of coastal ecosystems. In this study, we develop a dynamic model of benthic macrofauna to quantify the relationship between organic matter input and benthic macrofaunal biomass in the coastal zone. The model simulates the carbon dynamics of three functional groups of benthic macrofauna and their sediment food sources and is forced by a hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model simulating pelagic physical and biological dynamics. The model reproduces measured time-series of macrofaunal biomass from two coastal sites with contrasting sedimentation in the Baltic Sea in 1993\u20132005 with comparatively high accuracy, including a major increase at one of the sites dominated by the bivalve Limecola (Macoma) balthica. This shift in community composition suggests altered pathways of organic matter degradation: 39% of simulated sedimentation was mineralised by macrofauna in 2005 compared to 10% in 1995. From the early 2000s onward macrofaunal biomass seems to be food-limited, as ca 80% of organic carbon sedimentation was processed by the deposit-feeding macrofauna at both sites. This model is a first step to help quantify the role of macrofauna in marine coastal ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycles and build predictive capacity of the effects of anthropogenic stressors, such as eutrophication and climate change, on coastal ecosystems."}{"Observations and models to support the first Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean (MEASO) ": "Assessments of the status and trends of habitats, species and ecosystems are needed for effective ecosystem-based management in marine ecosystems. Knowledge on imminent ecosystem changes (climate change impacts) set in train by existing climate forcings are needed for adapting management practices to achieve conservation and sustainability targets into the future. Here, we describe a process for enabling a marine ecosystem assessment (MEA) by the broader scientific community to support managers in this way, using a MEA for the Southern Ocean (MEASO) as an example. We develop a framework and undertake an audit to support a MEASO, involving three parts. First, we review available syntheses and assessments of the Southern Ocean ecosystem and its parts, paying special attention to building on the SCAR Antarctic Climate Change and Environment report and the SCAR Biogeographic Atlas of the Southern Ocean. Second, we audit available field observations of habitats and densities and/or abundances of taxa, using the literature as well as a survey of scientists as to their current and recent activities. Third, we audit available system models that can form a nested ensemble for making, with available data, circumpolar assessments of habitats, species and food webs. We conclude that there is sufficient data and models to undertake, at least, a circumpolar assessment of the krill-based system. The auditing framework provides the basis for the first MEASO but also provides a repository (www.SOKI.aq/display/MEASO) for easily amending the audit for future MEASOs. We note that an important outcome of the first MEASO will not only be the assessment but also to advise on priorities in observations and models for improving subsequent MEASOs."}{"Disassembly of an epibenthic assemblage in a sustained severely hypoxic event in a northeast Pacific basin ": "As global ocean deoxygenation proceeds and the frequency of extreme low-oxygen (hypoxic) events increases, seafloor ecosystems will inevitably be affected. Our study examines how benthic community responses scale with the severity and spatial extent of hypoxia. Saanich Inlet is a natural model system for testing the effects of hypoxic conditions that determine the benthic megafaunal community structure during annual deoxygenation and reoxygenation. In 2016, an anomalously severe and widespread hypoxic event occurred in the fjord after a decade of oxygen decline at a rate of 0.07\u202fmL\u202fL\u22121\u202fy\u22121 as measured by a cabled seafloor observatory. We use a living ecological time-series generated from remotely operated vehicle surveys to assess how the benthic megafaunal community disassembled in response to this extreme hypoxic event. Three benthic surveys at similar times in 2013 and 2016 reveal large increases in the area of seafloor bathed in anoxic and hypoxic waters in the latter year. Both bottom oxygen and species depth distributions shoaled from 2013 to 2016, accompanied by a 56% overall decline in megafauna. The abundant habitat-forming pennatulacean octocoral, Halipteris willemoesi, decreased in abundance by 92.3% from fall 2013 to fall 2016, and pandalid shrimp disappeared from the community. Hypoxia-tolerant species experienced milder losses, and two new species occurred in 2016 \u2013 one a predator on the coral. Co-occurrence analyses revealed loss of significant community segregation from 2013 to 2016, and a re-mix of pairwise species co-occurrences in the latter year. The loss of oxygenated habitat compressed species into narrower depth ranges and led to disassembly probably through niche space constriction, while decimation of some populations eliminated key community associations. Community fragmentation and disruption of interactions is a possible outcome for many marine benthic ecosystems as marine hypoxia intensifies."}{"Glacial melting pulses in the Antarctica: Evidence for different responses to regional effects of global warming recorded in Antarctic bivalve shell (Laternula elliptica) ": "Meltwater history of the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica in Maxwell Bay, King George Island near the Antarctic Peninsula was reconstructed during the shell growth. High resolution trace elemental and stable isotopic compositions along the aragonite outer part of the shell together with growth bands shows that the shell lived for 9\u202fyears with distinct annual cycles. Also oxygen and carbon isotope values reveal the local meltwater history in Antarctic Peninsula region. More negative oxygen isotope values than the predicted equilibrium values clearly show that oxygen isotope depletion is due to lower salinity of seawater by glacial melting. This is also confirmed by the similar trend of low carbon isotope values as well as monitored sea surface salinity values. Comparing \u03b418O values of previous results using the same bivalve species, more negative values from the Antarctic Peninsula (Maxwell Bay) during the austral winter than from East Antarctica (Syowa Coast and Ross Sea) suggests that perennial glacial melting influenced seawater \u03b418O composition near the peninsula. Also, more negative and variable bivalve \u03b418O values during austral summer indicate that meltwater pulses fluctuated greatly in the study area. Distinctively different trends in bivalve \u03b418O profiles between the Antarctic Peninsula and East Antarctica may reflect differential responses to regional warming with regard to the recent global warming over the past few decades."}{"Impact of latest-glacial to Holocene sea-level oscillations on central Aegean shelf ecosystems: A benthic foraminiferal palaeoenvironmental assessment of South Evoikos Gulf, Greece ": "A high-resolution palaeoenvironmental investigation was conducted on the benthic foraminiferal record of two continuous sediment cores (DEH 5, DEH 1) in order to reconstruct the latest-Pleistocene to Holocene history of the South Evoikos Gulf (central Aegean Sea). This shallow (max. depth ~75\u202fm), semi-enclosed continental shelf setting has been heavily affected by the latest-glacial to modern-interglacial relative sea-level and climate oscillations that strongly affected the benthic foraminiferal community. The identified meiofaunal biofacies associated with the chronological framework allowed the recognition of four main time phases in the palaeoenvironmental and palaeobathymetric evolution of the gulf: (i) During the latest glacial-interglacial transition (>15.17\u202fka BP), highly-stressed confined shallow lagoonal conditions correspond to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sea-level lowstand. During that time, a natural barrier located at the mouth of the gulf effectively prevented communication with the open Aegean Sea and amplified the contribution of the local aquifers. (ii) The early post-LGM sea-level rise was initially marked by a weak marine connection, dominated by a pronounced seaward river progradation of local aquifers. However, immediately after (~14.7\u202fka BP), an enhanced rate of sea-level rise, synchronous with the Meltwater Pulse 1A (MWP-1A), is observed. At the end of the Pleistocene, the sedimentation rates decreased dramatically, as a result of the Younger Dryas (YD) cooling event. (iii) The Holocene sea-level rise was characterized by an extremely abrupt marine transgression (~11.29\u202fka BP), during which the sea-level in the Aegean Sea reached 55\u202fm below present sea level (b.p.s.l) and forcedly overcame the barrier that previously separated the gulf from the open sea. At ~8.67\u20137.77\u202fka BP, an upper circalittoral eutrophic environment emerged, which coincided with the coeval deposition of the sapropel S1 in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Immediately after, re-ventilation conditions were reinstated. (iv) The Holocene sea-level high-stand is characterized by upper circalittoral high-energy and vegetated conditions on the sea floor.\n               \n               \n                  Regional index terms\n                  Eastern Mediterranean; Central Aegean Sea; Greece; South Evoikos Gulf."}{"Integrating physical circulation models and genetic approaches to investigate population connectivity in deep-sea corals ": "Deepwater corals are found on hard grounds of the continental shelf and slope of all ocean basins, where they enhance the abundance and biodiversity of invertebrates and fishes. Despite their essential role in deep-sea ecosystems, the knowledge of the factors that promote or impede connectivity among discrete coral communities remains elusive. Logistical challenges prevent a direct quantification of the essential factors affecting connectivity, such as timing of spawning, time spent in the water column, and settlement behavior, as well as the details of the physical environment and its variability.\n                  This study argues that an integrated framework including population genetic approaches and physical models of the ocean circulation with larval particle tracking capabilities can enhance our understanding. Genetic approaches allow determination of general time-integrated patterns of dispersal distance and direction in virtually any species, while transport models can refine understanding of the processes behind the observed dispersal patterns. Here, this integrated approach is applied towards investigating the connectivity of a deepwater coral, Callogorgia delta, along the upper continental slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico. The circulation in the basin is simulated by a regional ocean model at 1\u202fkm horizontal resolution, which is sufficiently detailed to allow for the generation and evolution of submesoscale eddies and vorticity filaments, and for a reliable representation of major bathymetric features. Building upon data from four sites spanning about 250\u202fkm of distance and 400\u202fm of depth, it is concluded that depth differences on scales of tens to at most few hundreds of meters are sufficient to limit C. delta connectivity among sites. This result has important implications in the development of restoration and preservation strategies of deepwater corals in the Gulf of Mexico and calls for carefully accounting for the depth dimension in these efforts."}{"Dynamics of dissolved and particulate organic matter in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary and the adjacent East China Sea shelf ": "Two cruises that passed over Changjiang freshwater, through the Changjiang Estuary, and finally to the adjacent East China Sea (ECS) shelf were carried out in July 2015 and March 2016. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were measured at the three layers (surface, middle, and bottom) of 99 and 89 stations during the cruises in July 2015 and in March 2016, respectively. The concentrations of DOC and POC showed overall decreasing trends from land to sea; however, their highest concentrations always occurred around the mouth of the Changjiang River, where estuarine salinity fronts and turbidity maxima appeared simultaneously. The POC/DOC ratios showed values <1 in most samples during the two cruises, suggesting that DOC contributed to a larger fraction than POC to the total organic matter inventories. An exception occurred in the inner stations during March 2016. Variations of DOC and POC were mainly controlled by salinity and by the dynamics of suspended particulate matter concentrations, respectively, suggesting that these two organic matter pools were largely decoupled in most cases during the two cruises. One exception was found in the surface water in July 2015, when the overlying Changjiang Diluted Water (regarded as seawaters with a salinity <31) generally supported a release of DOC with ongoing seaward transport. The high percentage values of POC (%) in suspended particulate matter, indicating the higher Chlorophyll-a abundances, were always the main reason supporting the release of DOC. And the above results provided an example of the coupling between DOC and POC that occurred on the surface in the summer. The findings from this study provide insight into the coupling and decoupling between DOC and POC in the mixing zone of a large estuary, which may largely modify the final fluxes and properties of the terrestrial organic carbon from the land to the ocean."}{"An integrated modelling system for water quality forecasting in an urban eutrophic estuary: The Swan-Canning Estuary virtual observatory ": "Effective short- and long-term estuarine water quality management decisions require a holistic view of estuarine response to multiple stressors that may be achieved through the integration of numerical modelling and observed data. Such an approach has been developed for the Swan-Canning Estuary system, a eutrophic urban estuary in Western Australia under threat from nutrient enrichment and a drying climate. Numerical modelling was integrated with long-term monitoring to develop the system Swan-Canning Estuary Virtual Observatory (SCEVO), which has been used to facilitate water quality management and streamline prediction workflows of hindcast, forecast, and environmental response functions. The system is based on a validated 3D water quality model, integrated within a data management system and related environmental models. A machine-learning method to improve the patchy and time-lagged catchment inputs is also highlighted. This work has identified that the key challenge associated with estuarine water quality prediction is the capability to (1) simulate internal physical and biogeochemical processes at suitable spatial resolution to resolve the gradients along the freshwater-ocean continuum; and (2) transition from using routine monitoring data as the basis for management decisions to using a diverse and integrated set of data streams as the basis for real-time operational decisions. Recommendations for high-frequency monitoring to support water quality modelling and dynamic integration between numerical and observed data for improved forecasting are discussed."}{"Chlorophyll variability induced by mesoscale eddies in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean ": "High sea surface chlorophyll-a concentrations (CHL) and intensive mesoscale eddy activity coexist near the coast of Java in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean (SETIO) in upwelling season (July\u2013November). In this study, the modulation effects of mesoscale eddies on the local CHL variability are investigated by analyzing remote sensed as well as in situ observations together with ocean and atmospheric reanalysis data from 1997 to 2010. Within 400\u202fkm off the coast, the mean CHL inside cyclonic eddies (CEs) is 2\u20133-fold higher than background, and is obviously suppressed inside anticyclonic eddies (AEs). During upwelling season, more and stronger CEs are generated, which significantly contributes to the high mean CHL levels. A composite analysis revealed that CEs induce CHL anomalies through both vertical upwelling that elevates nutrient-rich water from the subsurface to the surface and horizontal advection that carries high-CHL water from the coast to the offshore area. These effects are particularly visible during the upwelling season, when advection of the background high CHL favors large eddy modulation on the CHL. The eddy-induced CHL anomalies also exhibit prominent interannual variability, which has a close relationship with the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The wind forcing of El Ni\u00f1o and positive IOD events can enhance the vertical shear of the background currents and favor energetic CEs off Java coast, which contributes to the interannual variability of the local CHL. These results underscore the fundamental role played by mesoscale eddies in the ocean dynamics, environment, and bio-system of this region."}{"Temporal scales of variability in the Mediterranean Sea ecosystem: Insight from a coupled model ": "We implement a 3D state-of-the-art hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model that is based on MITgcm-BFM online coupling to describe the temporal scales of the variability of the multi-decadal marine biogeochemistry in the Mediterranean Sea. This model is characterised by a horizontal resolution of 1/12\u00b0 and a multi-nutrient and multi-plankton framework and can reproduce the main physical and biogeochemical processes from the seasonal (and its inter-annual modulation) to the sub-weekly scales. The corroboration shows that the MITgcm-BFM hindcast exhibits good and consistent performance when simulating the basin-wide gradients of temperature, salinity and nutrients and the seasonal cycles of physical and phytoplankton dynamics, including the deep chlorophyll maximum and the primary production at the basin and sub-basin scales for the period of 1994\u20132012. Novel statistical metrics show that the seasonal variability equals approximately 50% of the spatio-temporal sub-domain mean for the surface temperature and is higher than 150% for nutrients and chlorophyll. Nevertheless, the high-frequency (sub-weekly) variability is not negligible and is approximately equal to the inter-annual modulation of the seasonal variability, i.e., 3% of the spatio-temporal mean for the temperature and 30% or greater for nutrients and chlorophyll. Moreover, the high-frequency variability exhibits a decreasing southward gradient in the Mediterranean basin, similar to the seasonal variability. A further analysis based on the wavelet method and performed at different Mediterranean sites highlights the significant power that is associated with sub-weekly periods, which adds to the annual and semi-annual patterns, confirming the importance of the high frequency scale of variability in the biogeochemistry of the basin."}{"Picophytoplankton variability: Influence of Rossby wave propagation in the southeastern Arabian Sea ": "The westward propagating Rossby waves and associated currents transport low salinity nutrient-rich water mass from the Bay of Bengal into the southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) during winter monsoon, and ensuing changes in physicochemical properties of water column regulate phytoplankton distribution in the latter region. Herein, we elucidate the influence of Rossby wave propagation on picophytoplankton community composition in the SEAS. We compare the picophytoplankton community structure between the Rossby front (low saline, high nitrate concentration and strong current) and the surrounding non-frontal regions (high saline, low nitrate and weak current) along a cruise track in the SEAS during early winter monsoon (November 2016). The higher abundance of phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus (\u2018dim\u2019 and \u2018bright\u2019 types) and lower abundance of Prochlorococcus in the frontal region than the non-frontal regions suggest that salinity and nitrate concentration in the water column significantly influence the picophytoplankton community dynamics. We argue that the advection of low saline water mass from the Bay of Bengal associated with Rossby wave propagation introduces a \u2018dim\u2019 phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus group in the frontal region, and the ensuing physicochemical changes in water column favor their growth, whereas low cell abundance of Prochlorococcus and Phycocyanin-rich Synechococcus suggests restricted growth of both the groups. These inferences indicate that Rossby wave associated circulation pattern and physicochemical changes in the water column regulate picophytoplankton community composition and its contribution to food web dynamics in the SEAS."}{"\u201cSensitivity of freshwater dynamics to ocean model resolution and river discharge forcing in the Hudson Bay Complex\u201d [J. Mar. Syst. 196, August 2019, Pages 48\u201364] ": ""}{"Decomposition of flotation reagents in solutions containing metal ions. Part II: Interactions between xanthate and metal ions in solutions ": "An earlier study (Part I) indicated that Cu2+ ion suppresses while Fe3+ ion promotes xanthate decomposition into CS2. The main factor responsible for the disparate effects was proposed to be the differences in interactions between xanthate and metal ions in solution. UV\u2013vis and FTIR spectrometers were used to examine the products of such interactions in the liquid and precipitate phases, respectively. For both metal ions, it was found that metal xanthate (i.e. cupric xanthate Cu2X2 and ferric xanthate FeX3) and dixanthogen (X2) are formed. Although for different metal ions metal xanthate and dixanthogen are formed by different mechanisms, generation of CS2 in the gas phase can be correlated to the formation and decomposition of the metal xanthate and dixanthogen. It was found that metal xanthate and dixanthogen both are responsible for the effects of metal ions on SIBX decomposition: with the increase of Cu/SIBX ratio, decrease of CS2 is accompanied by the decrease of Cu2X2 and X2; with the increase of Fe/SIBX ratio, increases of CS2 are accompanied by the increase of FeX3 and X2. Which compound, metal xanthate or dixanthogen, play a more important role in affecting the decomposition could not be determined yet. Further studies is also required to elucidate the mechanisms how Cu2X2, FeX3 and X2 are quantitatively determining the overall decomposition kinetics."}{"Surface modification of smithsonite with ammonia to enhance the formation of sulfidization products and its response to flotation ": "This paper proposed a promising method of improving the sulfidization flotation of smithsonite through surface modification with ammonia. The floatability of ammonia-modified smithsonite was superior to that of bare smithsonite under the same flotation condition due to the enhanced sulfidization. Results of zeta potential and surface adsorption experiments showed that the preliminary modification of smithsonite surfaces with ammonia increased the amount of sulfide ion species adsorbed onto the mineral surface, thereby facilitating the attachment of xanthate species onto the sulfidized mineral surface and promoting its hydrophobicity. XPS measurement revealed that surface modification with ammonia prior to Na2S addition increased the amounts of zinc sulfide species formed on the mineral surface and altered the chemical environment of sulfidization products. Furthermore, the activation mechanism of ammonia modification for enhancing the adsorption of sulfide species onto the smithsonite surface was studied by solution chemistry calculations. Zinc ammonia complexes were found to interact with hydrophilic species coated on the smithsonite surface. This interaction increased the number of zinc sites on the surface of ammonia-modified smithsonite and thus enhanced its sulfidization flotation."}{"The dissolution and passivation mechanism of chalcopyrite in bioleaching: An overview ": "Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is the most abundant copper-containing resource in the earth and is also widely distributed in solid wastes and secondary resources. Biohydrometallurgy (bioleaching) is considered as a promising minerals processing and extractive metallurgy technology because of its environmental and economic advantages over the conventional beneficiation-pyrometallurgy process, and the bioleaching of chalcopyrite is always a challenge because chalcopyrite can be easily passivated in bioleaching. Hence, it is important to understand the dissolution process and passivation mechanism of chalcopyrite in bioleaching. In this paper, the dissolution process and passivation mechanism of chalcopyrite bioleaching have been summarized and discussed according to previous publications. The reported possible passivating species are mainly S-containing species consisting of polysulfide (Sn\n                     2\u2212), elemental sulfur (S0) and insoluble sulfate (SO4\n                     2\u2212). The effects of physicochemical properties of chalcopyrite and multiple factors on the dissolution and passivation mechanism of chalcopyrite bioleaching have been summarized. We particularly discussed the role of redox potential in chalcopyrite bioleaching and its controlling techniques."}{"Flotation of mixed oxide sulphide copper-cobalt minerals using xanthate, dithiophosphate, thiocarbamate and blended collectors ": "More than half of the global cobalt supply from primary sources is currently produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from ores containing copper-cobalt oxides or copper-cobalt sulphides. Where oxide and sulphide cobalt-bearing copper minerals occur together, efficient recovery of copper and cobalt is known to be extremely difficult. This study investigates the flotation behaviour of a mixed oxide-sulphide ore where copper is hosted in sulphides phases such as bornite, chalcopyrite and chalcocite, and oxide phases such as malachite and to a lesser extent chrysocolla. Three cobalt-bearing oxide minerals are observed in the mixed ore, i.e. heterogenite, kolwezite and cupro-asbolane, while carrollite is the only cobalt-bearing sulphide mineral. A two-stage rougher-scavenger flotation process is used in which sulphides are extracted from the ore first. In the second stage, oxides are activated using controlled potential sulphidisation followed by their recovery. Tests are performed with a range of collectors, including xanthate, phosphorodithioate, dithiophosphate, thiocarbamate, and a blend type. A dithiophosphate collector proved to the most successful, achieving recovery of 94% of the carrollite, more than 90% of the copper sulphides, and 70% of the copper oxide minerals. The recovery of the cobalt oxides was less successful, with recovery of roughly half the kolwezite and only 20% of the heterogenite and cupro-asbolane. Despite the generally promising recoveries, the selectivity of the flotation process is relatively low with all the concentrates containing a significant amount of carbonate and silicate minerals. This suggests that a number of improvements require further investigation, notably the application of hydroxamate collectors, depressants and reverse flotation."}{"Systematic review of lithium extraction from salt-lake brines via precipitation approaches ": "Lithium is one of the most important raw materials for the production of glass, ceramics, nuclear materials, pharmaceuticals, and batteries. Almost 80% of total land-based lithium reserves globally are salt-lake brines. Therefore, lithium should be extracted from salt-lake brines to meet the demand of various industries for lithium resources. Several approaches for lithium extraction have been developed in the past few decades, such as precipitation, ion exchange, adsorption, solvent extraction, and electrolysis. Among these methods, precipitation is the earliest studied and utilized in industrial plants. Furthermore, it has several advantages, such as low cost, green principle, and easy industrialization. This paper reviews the precipitation technology for lithium extraction and the relative mechanism proposed in literature to identify its important parameters. Precipitant dosage, pH value, temperature, and particle size of precipitate are important factors in the process. Economic viability and green principle of various methods are discussed, and potential technologies are suggested. Novel magnesium precipitants appear to be a prospective technology for lithium extraction from brines with high Mg/Li mass ratios. Magnesium precipitation technology also shows great potential in the comprehensive utilization of lithium and magnesium resources. Various precipitation approaches for lithium extraction from brines and perspectives for further investigation are proposed."}{"Natural and anthropogenic oil impacts on benthic foraminifera in the southern Gulf of Mexico ": "The Campeche Sound is the major offshore oil producing area in the Southern Gulf of Mexico (SGoM). To evaluate the impact of oil related activities in the ocean floor sediments, we analyzed the geochemical (major and trace element, organic carbon and hydrocarbon concentrations) and biological (benthic foraminifera) composition of 62 superficial sediment samples, from 13 to 1336\u202fm water depth. Cluster and Factor analysis of all the variables indicate that their distribution patterns are mainly controlled by differences between the terrigenous and carbonate platforms in the SGoM. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages were abundant and diverse, and their distribution patterns are mainly determined by water depth and sedimentary environment. However, most of the abundant species are opportunistic and/or low-oxygen tolerant, and many of their tests show oil stains and infillings, characteristic of oil polluted locations, suggesting the environment has been modified by natural seepage or oil-related activities. To determine if these conditions are natural or anthropogenic in origin, pre - industrial settings should be studied. Organic carbon (Corg) content (0.6\u20132.9%) and total hydrocarbon concentrations (PAHs 1.0\u201329.5\u202f\u03bcg\u202fkg\u22121) were usually higher around the oil platforms area, the natural hydrocarbon seeps (\u201cchapopoteras\u201d) area and offshore rivers, but there is no accumulation of oil related trace elements in these areas. However, the comparison with international sediment quality benchmarks indicates that Cd, Cr and Ni concentrations are above the threshold effect level, and also As, Ba and Cu are above the probable effect level benchmarks, which indicate that these element concentrations might be of potential ecological concern. Comprehensive studies involving different proxies, and assessing pre-industrial conditions, must be undertaken before assessing environmental health of marine benthic ecosystems."}{"Imidacloprid and formulated product impacts the fatty acids and enzymatic activities in tissues of Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata\n             ": "The use of imidacloprid (IMI) and its formulated products in agriculture is a risk to aquatic organisms due to deposition into waterways from runoff and aerial spraying. However, there is limited information on the potential effects of this pesticide on commercially important shellfish, such as oysters. We investigated the impacts of IMI and Spectrum 200SC (IMI formulation) on the activity of the enzymes Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), Catalase (CAT) and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in different oyster tissues including the gill, adductor muscle and digestive gland. We also investigated the condition index and fatty acid composition of the flesh of oysters after 2 weeks exposure. The concentrations of IMI in the different tissues was assessed using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) after QuEChERS extraction. Higher concentrations of IMI residues were detected in the adductor muscle of the oysters, followed by the gills and with the lowest amounts recovered from the digestive gland across all the concentrations tested. IMI and Spectrum 200SC significantly affected the gill AChE activity at 2\u202fmg/L, but digestive gland CAT, and gill and digestive gland GST were impacted at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.01 and 0.05\u202fmg/L). In the whole oyster, 2 weeks exposure to IMI (\u22650.01\u202fmg/L) resulted in a proportional increase in saturated fatty acids (SFA), altered the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to SFA ratio and altered the omega 3 fatty acids (n-3) to omega 6 fatty acids (n-6) ratio, but there were no effects on the condition index of the oyster. Although the oysters responded differently to the formulated product, there was no consistent difference in the sublethal effects of analytical IMI and Spectrum 200SC. This study showed that exposure to IMI and Spectrum 200SC can significantly affect the biochemical processes and metabolites in oysters, with implications for food quality and safety."}{"Changes in zooplankton communities from epipelagic to lower mesopelagic waters ": "Zooplankton form a trophic link between primary producers and higher trophic levels, and exert significant influence on the vertical transport of carbon through the water column (\u2018biological carbon pump\u2019). Using a MultiNet we sampled and studied mesozooplankton communities (i.e. >0.2\u202fmm) from six locations around Bermuda targeting four depth zones: \u223c0\u2013200\u202fm, \u223c200\u2013400\u202fm, \u223c400\u2013600\u202fm (deep-scattering layer), and \u223c600\u2013800\u202fm. Copepoda, our focal taxonomic group, consistently dominated samples (\u223c80% relative abundance). We report declines in zooplankton and copepod abundance with depth, concurrent with decreases in food availability. Taxonomic richness was lowest at depth and below the deep-scattering layer. In contrast, copepod diversity peaked at these depths, suggesting lower competitive displacement in these more food-limited waters. Finally, omnivory and carnivory, were the dominant trophic traits, each one affecting the biological carbon pump in a different way. This highlights the importance of incorporating data on zooplankton food web structure in future modelling of global ocean carbon cycling."}{"Assessing the impact of introduced infrastructure at sea with cameras: A case study for spatial scale, time and statistical power ": "Detecting the effects of introduced artificial structures on the marine environment relies upon research and monitoring programs that can provide baseline data and the necessary statistical power to detect biological and/or ecological change over relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here we report on, and assess the use of, Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) systems as a technique to monitor diversity, abundance and assemblage composition data to evaluate the effects of marine renewable energy infrastructure on mobile epi-benthic species. The results from our five-year study at a wave energy development facility demonstrate how annual natural variation (time) and survey design (spatial scale and power) are important factors in the ability to robustly detect change in common ecological metrics of benthic and bentho-pelagic ecosystems of the northeast Atlantic. BRUV systems demonstrate their capacity for use in temperate, high energy marine environments, but also how weather, logistical and technical issues require increased sampling effort to ensure statistical power to detect relevant change is achieved. These factors require consideration within environmental impact assessments if such survey methods are to identify and contribute towards the management of potential positive or negative effects on benthic systems."}{"Impact of crude oil and the dispersant Corexit\u2122 EC9500A on capelin (Mallotus villosus) embryo development ": "Marine food webs are particularly vulnerable to oil spills if keystone species are impacted. To quantify lethal and sublethal toxicity in a key Holarctic forage fish, capelin embryos were exposed to Hibernia crude oil water accommodated fraction (WAF) produced at an oil-to-water ratio of 1:9 (v:v) and chemically-enhanced WAF (CEWAF) produced with the dispersant Corexit\u2122 EC9500A at a dispersant-to-oil ratio of 1:10 (CEWAF H) or 1:50 (CEWAF L). Corexit alone yielded similar embryotoxicity to CEWAF. 10% CEWAF H, with total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of 99.2\u202f\u03bcg/L, decreased embryo survival following 10\u202fh of exposure, while continual exposed to 1% CEWAF L decreased hatching and heart rates. Concentrations down to 0.1% CEWAF L increased in a dose-dependent manner the transcript level of cytochrome P4501a1 (cyp1a1) in hatched larvae. These data indicate that embryo-larval survival of capelin is likely at risk if an oil spill coincides in space and time with spawning."}{"Overview and trends of ecological and socioeconomic research on artificial reefs ": "It is presented a systematic literature review of artificial reef research, including 620 studies throughout the world from 1962 to 2018. The primary focus of this study was to examine long-term trends in research, focusing on ecological and socioeconomic questions, and to develop new research directions for this field. From 1962 to the beginning of the 1990s, the United States and Japan were the main centers of artificial reef research. Subsequently, researchers in several other countries (particularly China, Australia, Italy, Brazil, and the United Kingdom) began to focus on this subject, resulting in an increase in the number of artificial reef studies. In general, publications about artificial reefs have concentrated on investigating the structure of populations and marine communities and evaluating new technical designs and materials to construct artificial habitats. The science of artificial reefs is responding to new challenges with an increase in more elaborate techniques, such as the use of remotely-operated submarines, organic indicators, isotopes, and molecular biology, while research that evaluates the socioeconomic aspects of artificial reefs is lacking. There are many aspects that deserve more research attention, such as the use of alternative inert materials, environmental impact assessment and mitigation, and analysis of conflicts with affected fisheries communities. The greater challenge is to overcome the apparent division between theory vs. application and to include robust management models of these artificial environments."}{"Inter-annual isotopic niche segregation of wild humboldt penguins through years of different El Ni\u00f1o intensities ": "The Humboldt Current System presents high interannual variability, influenced by the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), whose implications in wildlife are not fully understood. We studied the isotopic niche of wild Humboldt penguins at Punta San Juan (Peru) during the pre-moult foraging trip in 4 consecutive years (2008\u20132011) under known oceanographic (ENSO) conditions. Our results show that there is a clear isotopic niche segregation (on both \u03b413C and \u03b415N values) of wild Humboldt penguins among all years. Besides isotopic niche segregation, niche width also varied significantly among years. The larger isotopic niche displayed in 2008 reflected the opportunistic feeding behaviour of Humboldt penguins when oceanographic conditions were unfavourable (i.e. El Ni\u00f1o of strong intensity). In contrast, and despite strong segregation, penguins displayed a more specialist behaviour in years of mild environmental conditions (i.e. 2009 \u201cwarm-weak\u201d, 2010 \u201cneutral\u201d and 2011 \u201cwarm-moderate\u201d). No evidence of sexual segregation in wild Humboldt penguins during the pre-moulting foraging trip was found. This study highlights the coping mechanisms of an endangered species to changes in environmental conditions (i.e. overall, from strong to neutral El Ni\u00f1o events), which should have important ramifications in the management of the marine ecosystem in Peru, particularly the one related to the anchovy industry."}{"Climate change induced range shifts in seaweeds distributions in Europe ": "There are evidences of how climate change is affecting seaweeds distribution and the ecosystems services they provide. Therefore, it is necessary to consider these impacts when managing marine areas. One of the most applied tools in recent years to deal with this are species distribution models, however there are still some challenges to solve, such as the inclusion of hydrodynamic predictors and the application of effective, transferable and user-oriented methodologies.\n                  Five species (Saccorhiza polyschides, Gelidium spinosum, Sargassum muticum, Pelvetia canaliculata and Cystoseira baccata) in Europe and 15 variables were considered. Nine of them were projected to the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for the mid-term (2040\u20132069) and the long term (2070\u20132099). Algorithms for each species were applied to generate models that were assessed by comparison of probabilities and observations (area under the curve, true skill statistics, Boyce index, sensitivity, correct classification rate), niches overlap (Schoener's D, Hellinger's I), geographical similarity (interquartile range) and ecological realism.\n                  Models built demonstrated very good predictive accuracy and sensitivity, without overfitting risk. A medium overlap in the historical and RCPs environmental conditions were obtained, therefore the models can be considered transferable and results accurate because only some isolated points were detected as outliers, corresponding to low probabilities.\n                  The areas of S. polyschides and G. spinosum have been identified to be dramatically reduced, meanwhile S. muticum and C. baccata were predicted to expand their range. P. canaliculata was expected to keep its sites of presence but with a decrease in its probability of occurrence. For all species it was remarkable the importance of hydrodynamic variables and parameters representing extreme conditions. Spatially predictions of the potential species and areas at risk are decisive for defining management strategies and resource allocation. The performance and usefulness of the approach applied in this study have been demonstrated for algae with different ecological requirements (from upper littoral to subtidal) and distributional patterns (native and invasive), therefore results can be used by marine planners with different goals: marine protected areas designation, monitoring efforts guiding, invasions risk assessment or aquaculture facilities zonation."}{"Firefighters' and instructors\u2019 absorption of PAHs and benzene during training exercises ": "Introduction\n                  Training fires may constitute a major portion of some firefighters\u2019 occupational exposures to smoke.

A single day of OSB exercises led to a 30-fold increase in 1-hydroxypyrene for instructors, culminating in a median end-of-shift concentration 3.5-fold greater than median levels measured from firefighters in a previous controlled-residential fire study. Breath concentrations of benzene increased 2 to 7-fold immediately after the training exercises (with the exception of simulated smoke training). Exposures were highest for the OSB scenario and instructors accumulated PAHs with repeated daily exercises.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Dermal absorption likely contributed to the biological levels as the respiratory route was well protected. Training academies should consider exposure risks as well as instructional objectives when selecting training exercises."}{"Burden of disease from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene for selected adverse health outcomes: An updated analysis with a focus on low- and middle-income countries ": "Background\n                  To develop updated estimates in response to new exposure and exposure-response data of the burden of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, malnutrition, schistosomiasis, malaria, soil-transmitted helminth infections and trachoma from exposure to inadequate drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours (WASH) with a focus on low- and middle-income countries.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  For each of the analysed diseases, exposure levels with both sufficient global exposure data for 2016 and a matching exposure-response relationship were combined into population-attributable fractions. Attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated for each disease and, for most of the diseases, by country, age and sex group separately for inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours and for the cluster of risk factors. Uncertainty estimates were computed on the basis of uncertainty surrounding exposure estimates and relative risks.\n               \n               \n                  Findings\n                  An estimated 829,000 WASH-attributable deaths and 49.8 million DALYs occurred from diarrhoeal diseases in 2016, equivalent to 60% of all diarrhoeal deaths. In children under 5 years, 297,000 WASH-attributable diarrhoea deaths occurred, representing 5.3% of all deaths in this age group. If the global disease burden from different diseases and several counterfactual exposure distributions was combined it would amount to 1.6 million deaths, representing 2.8% of all deaths, and 104.6 million DALYs in 2016.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Despite recent declines in attributable mortality, inadequate WASH remains an important determinant of global disease burden, especially among young children. These estimates contribute to global monitoring such as for the Sustainable Development Goal indicator on mortality from inadequate WASH."}{"Human biomonitoring in health risk assessment in Europe: Current practices and recommendations for the future ": "Human biomonitoring (HBM) is an important tool to survey the internal exposure of humans which represents the real life chemical body burden to chemicals and/or their metabolites. It results from total exposure to chemical substances from different sources and via different routes. These substances may be regulated under different legislative frameworks on chemicals (e.g., environmental, occupational, food safety etc). In occupational health, HBM has long traditions to control the exposures at workplaces. By providing accurate data on internal exposure, HBM data can improve human health risk assessment (RA) for both the general population and workers. Although the past few years have shown good examples on the use of HBM in the RA of chemicals, there is still quite some work to be done to improve its use in a regulatory RA.\n                  Under the scope of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (project HBM4EU, 2017\u20132021), the current study reviews the state-of-the-art of HBM use in chemicals RA with a special focus in Europe, and attempts to identify hurdles and challenges faced by regulators. To gather information on the use of HBM, including the availability of guidance on how to use it in RA, the RA schemes applied by different European or international organizations were analysed. Examples of such use were identified for a few selected groups of chemicals of concern for human health. In addition, we present the results of a survey, aimed at collecting information from national regulatory risk assessors on their day-to-day RA practices, the use of HBM data, and the obstacles and challenges related to their use. The results evidenced and explained some of the current obstacles of using HBM data in RA. These included the lack of HBM guidance values or biomonitoring equivalents (BEs), limited toxicokinetic information to support the interpretation of HBM data and, in the occupational health and safety (OSH) field, the lack of legal enforcement. Therefore, to support the integration of HBM in regulatory RA, we recommend, on one hand, the elaboration of a EU level guidance on the use of HBM in RA and, on the other hand, the continuation of research efforts to integrate HBM with new RA approaches using in vitro/in silico data and Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs)."}{"Capacity building and training approaches for water safety plans: A comprehensive literature review ": "The World Health Organization has recommended Water Safety Plans (WSPs), a holistic risk assessment and risk management approach, for drinking-water suppliers across low-, middle- and high-income countries, since publishing its 2004 Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality. While rapid WSP adoption has occurred, capacity is still catching up to implementation needs. Many countries and regions lack case examples, legal requirements, and training resources for WSPs, corresponding to widespread capacity shortfall in the water supply sector. We undertook a comprehensive review of the literature on capacity building and training for WSPs, with the goal of providing recommendations for multiple stakeholder groups at the scales of individual utilities, national governments, and intermediate units of governance. We propose a WSP training taxonomy and discuss it in relation to the stages of learning (introduction, practice, and reinforcement); describe the importance of customizing training to the target group, local language and circumstances; highlight the relevance of auditing for evaluating change over time; and call for robust methods to monitor WSP capacity development."}{"Long-term persistence of infectious Legionella with free-living amoebae in drinking water biofilms ": "Prolific growth of pathogenic Legionella pneumophila within engineered water systems and premise plumbing, and human exposure to aerosols containing this bacterium results in the leading health burden of any water-related pathogen in developed regions. Ecologically, free-living amoebae (FLA) are an important group of the microbial community that influence biofilm bacterial diversity in the piped-water environment. Using fluorescent microscopy, we studied in-situ the colonization of L. pneumophila in the presence of two water-related FLA species, Willaertia magna and Acanthamoeba polyphaga in drinking water biofilms. During water flow as well as after periods of long-stagnation, the attachment and colonization of L. pneumophila to predeveloped water-biofilm was limited. Furthermore, W. magna and A. polyphaga showed no immediate interactions with L. pneumophila when introduced to the same natural biofilm environment. A. polyphaga encysted within 5\u20137\u202fd after introduction to the tap-water biofilms and mostly persisted in cysts till the end of the study period (850\u202fd). W. magna trophozoites, however, exhibited a time delay in feeding on Legionella and were observed with internalized L. pneumophila cells after 3 weeks from their introduction to the end of the study period and supported putative (yet limited) intracellular growth. The culturable L. \n                     pneumophila in the bulk water was reduced by 2-log over 2\u202fyears\u202fat room temperature but increased (without a change in mip gene copies by qPCR) when the temperature was elevated to 40\u202f\u00b0C within the same closed-loop tap-water system without the addition of nutrients or fresh water. The overall results suggest that L. pneumophila maintains an ecological balance with FLA within the biofilm environment, and higher temperature improve the viability of L. pneumophila cells, and intracellular growth of Legionella is possibly cell-concentration dependent. Observing the preferential feeding behavior, we hypothesize that an initial increase of FLA numbers through feeding on a range of other available bacteria could lead to an enrichment of L. pneumophila, and later force predation of Legionella by the amoeba trophozoites results in rapid intracellular replication, leading to problematic concentration of L. pneumophila in water. In order to find sustainable control options for legionellae and various other saprozoic, amoeba-resisting bacterial pathogens, this work emphasizes the need for better understanding of the FLA feeding behavior and the range of ecological interactions impacting microbial population dynamics within engineered water systems."}{"Including aspects of climate change into water safety planning: Literature review of global experience and case studies from Ethiopian urban supplies ": "In recent years, the water safety plan approach has been extended towards climate-resilient water safety planning. This happened in response to increasing insight into impacts of climate on drinking-water and required adaptation to anticipated climate change. Literature was reviewed for published guidance and case examples, documenting how to consider climate in water safety planning to support future uptake. Climate-resilient water safety plans were piloted within a project in the water supplies of Addis Ababa and Adama, Ethiopia.\n                  Case examples have been published in four of six WHO regions with a focus on urban supplies. Integration of climate aspects focused mostly on the steps of establishing the team, system description, hazard analysis and risk assessment, improvement planning and development of management procedures. While the traditional framework focuses on drinking-water quality, considering climate change augments aspects of water quantity. Therefore, other factors affecting water quantity such as population development and demand of other sectors need to be considered as well. Local climate information and tools should be employed as a significant success factor for future uptake. Such information should be incorporated as it becomes available, and may \u2013 depending on the setting \u2013 be incrementally integrated into existing water safety plans or used to develop new ones."}{"The impact of on-site hospital wastewater treatment on the downstream communal wastewater system in terms of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes ": "This study quantified antibiotic and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) concentrations in hospital and communal wastewaters as well as the influents and effluents of the receiving urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTP) in two Dutch cities. In only one city, hospital wastewater was treated on-site using advanced technologies, including membrane bioreactor treatment (MBR), ozonation, granulated activated carbon (GAC) and UV-treatment.\n                  On-site hospital wastewater (HWW) treatment reduced gene presence of hospital-related antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic concentrations in the receiving urban wastewater treatment plant. These findings support the need for on-site treatment of high-risk point sources of antibiotic resistance genes.\n                  13 antibiotic resistance genes, Integrase Class 1 and 16S rRNA concentrations were quantified using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays and the presence and/or concentration of 711 antibiotics were analyzed.\n                  Hospital wastewater contained approximately 25% more antibiotics and gene concentrations between 0.4 log to 1.8-fold higher than communal wastewater (CWW). bla\n                     KPC and vanA could be identified as hospital-related genes and were reduced to under the limit of detection (LOD) during on-site treatment. Advanced on-site treatment removed between 0.5 and 3.6-fold more genes than conventional biological urban wastewater treatment (activated sludge). Advanced on-site treatment was able to eliminate 12 out of 19 detected antibiotics, while urban waste water treatment eliminated up to 1 (out of 21 detected). Different advanced treatment technologies were able to target different pollutants to varying extents, making sequential alignment more effective. MBR treatment was most efficient in antibiotic resistance gene reduction and ozonation in antibiotic reduction.\n                  \n                     bla\n                     KPC could only be detected in the influent of the urban wastewater treatment plant receiving untreated hospital wastewater. Similarly, vanA was only consistently detected in this treatment plant. These results indicate a positive effect of on-site treatment of hospital wastewater on the communal sewage system."}{"How current risk assessment and risk management methods for drinking water in The Netherlands cover the WHO water safety plan approach ": "In the Netherlands, safe and sufficient drinking water is provided to the general population by ten drinking water companies. To guarantee safe drinking water the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a Water Safety Plan (WSP), a Risk Assessment and a Risk Management (RA/RM) framework. The objective of the study was to identify legally required RA approaches, to document application of RA/RM activities at Dutch drinking water companies and to determine to what extent these RA/RM activities as a whole cover all the elements of the WHO WSP approach. This study could be of interest to both managers of large water utilities and decision makers.\n                  The assessment was performed by means of a policy review and interviews with two to four staff members involved in RA/RM from all ten Dutch drinking water companies combined with a joint workshop. The drinking water companies are well aware of the potential hazards and risks that can influence the drinking water quality. To guarantee the supply of safe and sufficient drinking water, the Dutch drinking water sector uses six different legally required RA/RM approaches. This study shows that by using the six legally required RA/RM approaches, all WSP steps are covered. WSP entails a generic risk assessment for identifying all hazards and hazardous events from source to tap, whereas the six legally required RA/RM each focus on specific risks at an advanced level. Each risk assessment provides information on specific hazards and hazardous events covering a part of the water supply chain. These legal requirements are complemented with additional RA/RM activities at sector and water company level such as codes of practices and standard operating procedures. The outcomes of all RA/RM approaches combined provide information from source to tap. When using multiple RA/RM approaches, it is crucial to share and combine information derived from the different activities."}{"Effect of domestic cooking methods on protein digestibility and mineral bioaccessibility of wild harvested adult edible insects ": "Wild harvested edible insects are characterised by high protein and mineral contents with potential to contribute substantially to nutrition security. However, nutritional content is only beneficial when proteins are digestible and minerals bioaccessible. This study determined the effects of domestic processing on protein digestibility and mineral bioaccessibility of two wild harvested insect species: Eulepida mashona (beetle) and Henicus whellani (cricket). Samples of both insects were subjected to boiling, roasting, or combined boiling and roasting, imitating the way insects are traditionally prepared in Zimbabwe. Moreover, they were in vitro digested according to INFOGEST protocol. Boiling of both insects resulted in loss of protein as it leached into the boiling water. The raw insects had a higher protein in vitro digestibility than the boiled and roasted insects, and the maximal decrease in protein digestibility was around 25% for twice boiling of the beetles and for boiled and roasted crickets. For both insect species, boiling resulted in non-significant loss of iron and zinc. Iron was the least bioaccessible mineral in both insects, based on the concentrations of soluble mineral measured by ICP-AES. However, beetles had a much higher iron bioaccessibility (30.7%) as compared to crickets (8.11%). Interestingly, boiling resulted in about 50% decrease in iron and zinc bioaccessibility in both species while roasting did not. The reduced protein digestibility and mineral accessibility with processing can be explained by protein modification and interactions of minerals with other food components, such as chitin and phytochemicals. Because of the reduction in protein digestibility and mineral accessibility during boiling, roasting should be favoured over boiling and in any case short boiling time is recommended."}{"Removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions by adsorption using single and mixed pillared clays ": "This work concerns the application of single and mixed pillared clays in adsorption of inorganic pollutant in the water: the cadmium, the cobalt, and the copper. Adsorption experiments were conducted under various conditions, i.e., pH, contact time, initial concentration, and temperature. A comparison of the adsorption of the three metals onto pillared clays and natural clays suggested that pillared clays had higher adsorption affinity for metals than the unpillared clays. The experimental results indicated that the pillared clays rich on cerium show better properties on Cd2+, Co2+, and Cu2+ adsorption than those without cerium, which made them the promising recycling metals adsorbents. The equilibrium isotherm data were analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations. In all cases, the adsorption process fitted the second-order kinetics well, and the isotherm equation due to Langmuir showed good fits with the experimental data."}{"Interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals: New insights and broader applications ": "Interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals are ubiquitous in nature and are involved in the formation and transformation of clay minerals and the global cycles of many elements. The fungi/actinomyces in microbes are also associated with clay minerals, but bacteria are more widely linked. These interactions are also involved in the adsorption and fixation of heavy metals and the decomposition of organic pollutants in soil. Knowledge of these interactions can be utilised for the refinement and purification of clay minerals in industry. This review provides an overview of recent studies and obtains insights into the interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals. Microorganisms can induce the nucleation and growth of clay minerals. The metabolism of microorganisms can also degrade and transform clay minerals. The interaction between microorganisms and clay minerals promots the transformation of smectite to illite (S-I) and vice versa (I-S). Such interactions significantly contribute to the global cycles of various elements, such as Al, Si, Mg, Fe, P, S, C, and N. Microorganisms and clay minerals can form complexes and composite materials that adsorb heavy metals such as Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn, Co, Ni, Ag, and Hg. Microorganism adhesion to clay minerals is involved in the synergistic adsorption and decomposition of organic pollutants in soil and water. This literature review indicates that knowledge of the interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals has been significantly deepened over recent years. However, the interaction between microorganisms and clay minerals under natural geological conditions and the inherent mechanisms involved are not yet well understood. Future work on interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals has great implications for handling atmospheric micro/nano particle pollutants, understanding the formation, alteration and diagenesis of clay minerals and other related minerals, tracking primitive life on Earth and exploring extraterrestrial planets."}{"Layered double hydroxide based bionanocomposites ": "Layered double hydroxides (LDH), also identified as anionic clays, have attracted much consideration due to their excellent ion exchange capacities, shape memory effect and ability to intercalate anions. LDH have been used in the different fields of applications such as biomedical, sensors and detectors, energy storage, novel and advanced functional materials etc. On other hand, biopolymers are environment friendly, fully degradable and sustainable materials, so they can be easily composed without harming nature. Degradation of biopolymers involves loss of structural, mechanical and chemical properties of the polymer and converting into biodegradable compounds which are helpful to the environment. Thus, bionanocomposites made from LDH and different biopolymers would have synergistic effect on their properties, which are necessary for actual applications. This review article deals with the preparation, properties and applications of bionanocomposites made from LDH and biopolymers such as heparin, deoxyribose nucleic acid, vitamin C and E, cellulose, chitosan, polylactic acid, different anionic biopolymers and starch."}{"Keggin-Al30: An intercalant for Keggin-Al30 pillared montmorillonite ": "Clay minerals intercalated with inorganic species, known as pillared interlayered clays, have received extensive attention in recent decades. In this work, by comparison with those of Keggin-Al13, the formation processes of Keggin-Al30 are discussed based on different hydrolysis reactions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscope, and thermogravimetric analyses were applied to compare differences in crystal structure, morphology, and thermal stability between Keggin-Al13 and Keggin-Al30 (sulfates). High temperature and excess monomeric Al species are key factors controlling the transformation from \u03b5-Keggin-Al13 to \u03b4-Keggin-Al13 and finally to Keggin-Al30. A decrease of the crystal symmetry from Keggin-Al13 to Keggin-Al30 was confirmed by shifts of reflections (and decreases of intensities) on XRD patterns. Keggin-Al30 has a more compact structure, which leads to higher thermal stability. The distributions of functional groups and positive charges on the surface of Keggin-Al30 result in a \u201clying flat\u201d arrangement configuration in the interlayer region of montmorillonite. Exploring the behaviors of polycations as intercalants from their formation, transformation, and properties during the pillaring process may offer better understandings of the enhanced properties and wide applications of pillared interlayered clays."}{"Adsorption of propranolol onto montmorillonite: Kinetic, isotherm and pH studies ": "The objective of this study was to explore the potential use of the smectite clay mineral montmorillonite (Mt) as adsorbent in the removal of water containing the emerging compound propranolol. The Mt was deeply characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Zeta potential and thermogravimetric analysis (DSC-TG), before and after adsorption experiments, and their isotherms and kinetic models were fitted to assess the adsorption of propranolol.\n                  The incorporation of propranolol in the interlayer was demonstrated by XRD and DSC-TG. The results obtained by Zeta potential indicated no adsorption of propranolol in the surface. Kinetic of propranolol adsorption onto Mt. was evaluated using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intra-particle diffusion and Elovich models. Pseudo-second order was the kinetic model that best described the adsorption of propranolol (R2\u202f>\u202f0.999). It was possible to obtain a removal efficiency of approximately 96% in <1\u202fmin. The adsorption equilibrium isotherm was fitted with the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevitch mathematical models to obtain the respective parameters. Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevitch were the models that best fitted the experimental data (R2\u202f>\u202f0.999). Due to the cationic form of propranolol, the adsorption by ionic exchange between charged propranolol and sodium cations onto the interlayer space was the most favorable pathway proposed. Results indicate that adsorption onto Mt proved to be an efficient method for removing propranolol, thus being a viable alternative for the treatment of water contaminated with this drug."}{"Adsorption of a cationic methylene blue dye on an Algerian palygorskite ": "The capacity of an Algerian Tertiary sedimentary palygorskite to remove methylene blue was studied. The raw material was characterized using X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and chemical, granulometric and micotextural analyses. Kinetic experiments were carried out to study the effect of contact time, stirring speed, initial dye concentration and adsorbent mass on the adsorption processes. The palygorskite-rich material mainly consists of this fibrous clay (72%) and calcite (19%) with minor amounts of dolomite (5%), illite (2%) and quartz (2%). After 5\u202fmin contact time at room temperature, the adsorption reaction of a 50\u202fmL solution containing 10\u202fppm of methylene blue on 50\u202fmg of Cal-Pal as adsorbent reached equilibrium, and 97% of cationic dye was fixed. Temperature did not have a significant influence on methylene blue adsorption. The obtained adsorption isotherm indicates high affinity between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. The use of the studied Algerian palygorskite-rich sediment may have great potential for the elimination of textile dyes."}{"Competitive adsorption of antibiotic tetracycline and ciprofloxacin on montmorillonite ": "As antibiotics continue to be released into soils, it poses a potential threat to human and animal health. The migration-transformation of contaminants in soils is strongly affected by adsorption on clay. Tetracycline (TC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) which are extensively used have been attracted attention recently. Based on adsorption kinetics, isotherm, FT-IR, XRD and molecular simulation, the intercalation and environmental behavior of TC or CIP by montmorillonite (Mt) as single or mixed substance were studied and the adsorption mechanism was also proved. In the mixed system, the relationship between TC and CIP was a competition, but no preferential adsorption. The interaction between antibiotics in interlayer and the adsorption energies were simulated and calculated by molecular simulation to reveal the experimental results."}{"Performance of magnetite/layered double hydroxide composite for dye removal via adsorption, Fenton and photo-Fenton processes ": "In order to investigate the effect of the addition of magnetite in layered double hydroxide (LDH) from a structural and catalytic point of view, the synthesis of LDH containing cobalt and chromium (CoCr-LDH) was performed with or without Fe3O4. These materials were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N2 adsorption Isotherms, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and evaluated as adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts in Fenton-like and photo-Fenton-like reactions. The results showed that the magnetite was prepared and incorporated to the LDH with success, forming a composite providing magnetic properties and promoting alteration in the morphology, quantity and size of the LDH pores. The evaluation of the adsorption and oxidation processes utilizing the Fe3O4/LDH composite showed to be more efficient than for pure LDH. This better performance can be explained by higher surface area and larger pores for Fe3O4/LDH which allow a more effective contact with the dye solution and more proximity of large molecules like those of Reactive Black with the sites where the OH\u2022 radicals are formed."}{"Sepiolite/TiO2 and metal ion modified sepiolite/TiO2 nanocomposites: synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic activity in abatement of NOx gases ": "Un-exchanged and Zn or Cu ion exchanged samples of a newly discovered sepiolite clay from Greece were combined with nanophase anatase titania for the synthesis of sepiolite based nanocomposites and tested for oxidation of NOx gases. The Zn or Cu ion exchanged clay was modified by replacing the exchangeable cations with Zn or Cu ions. Three separate single phase sepiolite samples were prepared, i.e., the sepiolite (S), the one modified with Zn (Zn-S) and the one modified with Cu (Cu-S). Additionally, three nanocomposites were synthesized combining the above three sepiolite samples with TiO2 in weight ratios of 30:70 and named S-TiO2, Zn-S-TiO2 and Cu-S-TiO2, respectively by depositing TiO2 (anatase) on the sepiolite surfaces using titanium isopropoxide as a precursor under hydrothermal treatment at 180\u202f\u00b0C. The phase composition, particle morphology and physical properties of the sepiolite samples and the nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, ATR-FTIR, TEM, DRS-UV\u2013Vis and N2-sorption/desorption analyses. The photocatalytic activity of all the clay mineral-titania nanocomposites was examined in the decomposition NOx gases. Sepiolite and especially Zn modified sepiolite based nanocomposites showed better photocatalytic activity for the oxidation of NOx gases compared to that of reference photocatalyst titania P25 under UV-light irradiation."}{"Hectorite: Synthesis, modification, assembly and applications ": "Hectorite (Na0.3Mg2.7Li0.3Si4O10(OH)2) is a trioctahedral clay mineral with peculiar cation exchange capacity, surface reactivity and adsorption, and easy delamination in water into individual nanolayers, which can then re-assemble in various ways. The aqueous dispersion of hectorite exhibits exclusive rheological and thixotropic properties. The paper reviews recent progress in the synthesis, modification, assembly and applications of hectorite. The present methods for synthesizing hectorite are hydrothermal synthesis, melt synthesis and structure-directed synthesis. Modification of hectorite can be made by ion exchange, intercalation, pillaring and grafting. Layer-by-layer assembly, template assembly and hierarchical assembly have been used to formed a variety of hectorite-containing hybrids and nanocomposites such as films, membranes, capsules and Janus nanoparticles. Hectorite and hectorite-derived materials can be used as adsorbents, catalysts, fluorescent reporters, hydrogels, and biomaterials. Literature survey has indicated that hectorite has been successfully used as rheological and thixotropic materials, and are being developed to be used in battery, fluorescent reporters, drug vehicles and tissue engineering."}{"Phosphate capture by ultrathin MgAl layered double hydroxide nanoparticles ": "Capture of phosphorus from runoff and wastewater is of high priority in order to reclaim phosphorus for food security and to prevent water pollution. Here we report an environmentally friendly method to synthesize ultrathin MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles for phosphorus adsorption. Fast co-precipitation of magnesium and aluminum at 25\u201380\u202f\u00b0C in the presence of urea resulted in the desired LDH with variable admixtures of amorphous aluminum hydroxide (16\u201338%) quantified from solid state 27Al MAS NMR. Freshly synthesized particles appeared as exfoliated single layers that upon drying stacked to form particles with thickness of 3 to 5\u202fnm (four to six LDH layers) and lateral sizes of ~30\u202fnm, as seen by XRD, SEM, TEM, and AFM. Phosphate adsorption on LDH nanoparticles synthesized at room temperature (LDHns-U25) was very fast and reaction reached equilibrium within 15\u202fmin at pH\u202f8.5. The freeze-dried LDHns-U25 nanoparticles exhibited phosphate sorption capacity of 98\u202f\u00b1\u202f15\u202fmg P\u00b7g\u22121, which is 55% higher than for conventional LDH. Phosphate was bound to LDH electrostatically and via inner-sphere surface complexation as evidenced from a combination of 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy, surface potential measurements, IR spectroscopy, and ionic strength effects on phosphate sorption. This study demonstrates that urea-facilitated synthesis of LDH nanoparticles provides high capacity phosphate sorbents with potentials for phosphate recovery from waste waters."}{"Effects of properties of minerals adsorbents for the adsorption and desorption of volatile organic compounds (VOC) ": "In this study, adsorption and desorption performance of three mineral adsorbents (diatomite, clinoptilolite, and palygorskite) was investigated for abatement of six VOC with distinct physical and chemical properties and functional groups. Among the three mineral adsorbents, palygorskite exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for all the tested VOC as indicated by the adsorption breakthrough curves. Characterization of the adsorbents showed that palygorskite had the highest specific surface area and pore volume. The distinct adsorption capacities of minerals for VOC can be attributed to the difference of VOC's boiling point and polarity. Increasing the adsorption temperature and relative humidity decreased adsorption capacity of the minerals for VOC. Non-polar VOC showed more sensitivity to changes in temperature and relative humidity compared to polar VOC. Desorption performance of the mineral adsorbents was studied in 5-cycle adsorption/desorption experiments. The results indicated that the desorption purge gas has no significant impact on desorption efficiency. However, increasing desorption temperature clearly decreased the cumulative heel on the adsorbent. Moreover, non-polar VOC desorbed better from the mineral surface than polar VOC."}{"Rectorite-supported nano-Fe3O4 composite materials as catalyst for P-chlorophenol degradation: Preparation, characterization, and mechanism ": "Clay minerals, as abundant natural resources, are among the most suitable supporting materials for nano metal. In this manuscript, new Fe3O4 nanoparticle/rectorite (Fe3O4/rectorite) catalysts are developed via in-situ precipitation oxidation reaction. Various physicochemical characterizations of Fe3O4/rectorite show that Fe3O4 nanoparticles (nano-Fe3O4) with an average particle diameter of approximately 10\u201320\u202fnm are effectively loaded on the surface of acid leached rectorite (Al-rectorite) and have low coaggregation and improved dispersion. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Fe3O4/rectorite on degradation of P-chlorophenol by heterogeneous Fenton method is studied. Results of degradation experiments show that Fe3O4/rectorite has higher degradation efficiency of P-chlorophenol than bare nano-Fe3O4. Regeneration studies also show that Fe3O4/rectorite maintains 100% of its maximum P-chlorophenol degradation capacity after seven consecutive cycles. Fe3O4/rectorite can be easily separated by magnetic separation, and thus has good stability and reusability. The degradation mechanism of Fe3O4/rectorite is adsorption coupled with a Fenton-like reaction, which accounts for P-chlorophenol degradation of up to 625\u202fmg/g. This work demonstrates a new composite material for the effective remediation of refractory organic compounds from wastewater."}{"Decontamination of caesium and strontium from stainless steel surfaces using hydrogels ": "Current methods for the decontamination of radioactively contaminated surfaces in nuclear facilities typically rely on the use of liquid agents to remove radionuclides. This generates large volumes of highly hazardous liquid waste which must then be treated in costly processes which often require purpose built plant. For the first time we report a nitric acid loaded polymer hydrogel based approach which gives a high decontamination factor for the removal of 137Cs and 90Sr on 304\u202fL grade stainless steel surfaces. The generation of minimal liquid waste and no lateral spread or increased penetration of radionuclides helps mitigate many of the intrinsic hazards of liquid based decontamination methods. Once dried these gels are able to retain the contaminants for treatment as solid waste resulting in a concentrated, less mobile waste form presenting significantly reduced hazards and treatment constraints."}{"Design and development of self-healing coating based on thiol\u2013epoxy reactions ": "Cracks caused by the effects of mechanical or chemicals forces on coatings may cause their performance to deteriorate and may shorten their lifetime. The microcapsules used for self-healing coatings provide automatic recovery and extend the life of the coatings. In this study, polyurea-formaldehyde epoxy resin (PUF-epoxy) microcapsules were synthesized by in-situ polymerization; because, they allow the size control of the microcapsules, the thickness of the shell can be controlled, its production is easy, it is cheap and combinable with industry. Synthesized microcapsules were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), optical microscope, UV spectrum, zeta analyzer and contact angle measurements. As a result of the thermal analysis, the core (epoxy) content of the microcapsules was 57% by weight and 60% by the extraction method based on the principle of selective dissolution, and these two values were compatible with each other. The average microcapsule diameter was found as 185\u202fnm. For the first time in the literature, an epoxy-containing microcapsule was added to the thiol-containing coating material and a self-healing coating was prepared. The epoxy-containing microcapsules were artificially cracked and the epoxy resin released from it reacted with the thiol received in the coating. For this reason, it was observed that the artificial scratches formed on the coatings showed good self-healing properties."}{"Effect of backbone structure on the thermoelectric performance of indacenodithiophene-based conjugated polymers ": "Two indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based conjugated polymers, PIDT-EDOT and PIDTT-EDOT, were designed and synthesized as organic thermoelectric materials. Compared to PIDT-EDOT, the IDT unit of PIDTT-EDOT was extended by incorporating two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units into the polymer main chain. The polymer PIDTT-EDOT showed better thermal stability and more planar conjugated structure than PIDT-EDOT. Meanwhile, different thermoelectric properties were observed when the two polymer films were doped with FeCl3. PIDTT-EDOT showed better thermoelectric properties than PIDT-EDOT, and the highest power factor observed for PIDTT-EDOT was 0.867\u202f\u03bcW\u202fm\u22121\u202fK\u22122 at 453\u202fK, which is approximately 25 times higher than that of PIDT-EDOT. These results indicate that a slight change in the polymer main chain will have a great impact on the thermoelectric properties of IDT-based conjugated polymers. The data presented herein can be used as a reference for the design of new high-performance thermoelectric materials."}{"Dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose cross-linked chitosan for the recovery of palladium and platinum from aqueous solution ": "Platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) have widespread applications, such as in catalysts, jewelry, fuel cells, and electronics because of their favorable physical and chemical properties. Recovery of Pt and Pd from secondary sources is of great concern due to the increased market demand and limitation of the natural reserves of these precious metals. The aim of this research is to achieve recovery of Pt and Pd ions from dilute aqueous solution using dialdehyde of carboxymethyl cellulose (DCMC) crosslinked chitosan (Ch-DCMC). The DCMC was prepared by periodate oxidation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Both the DCMC and Ch-DCMC were characterized before and after Pt or Pd adsorption using Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of cross-linking ratios of chitosan and DCMC (1:1, 1:0.8, 1:0.5, 1:0.25 and 1:0.1) on the Pt and Pd recovery was studied. The optimal cross-linking ratio was found to be 1:0.25 (chitosan: DCMC) with maximum adsorption capacity of 80.8\u202fmg/g Pt and 89.4\u202fmg/g Pd. High selectivity for Pt and Pd compared to base metals and common anions was achieved."}{"Low cost fabrication of polypropylene fiber composite membrane with excellent mechanical, superhydrophilic, antifouling and antibacterical properties for effective oil-in-water emulsion separation ": "In this work, a low cost and flexible composite membrane containing the meltblown and spunbond polypropylene (PP) microfibers was designed and fabricated by means of the hot pressing followed by dip-coating of chitosan solution. We systematically studied the morphological structure, wettability, mechanical property, anti-oil fouling and anti-bacterial performance. The chitosan-modified PP (CS-PP) composite membrane exhibited the superhydrophilicity, underwater superoleophobicity and ultralow oil-adhesion property. Meanwhile, it was found that, solely under the driving of gravity, the water permeation flux of the CS-PP composite membrane was 325, 315, 276 and 265\u202fL\u00b7m\u00b7\u22122\u00b7h\u22121 for the toluene-in-water, n-hexane-in-water, diesel-in-water and vegetable oil-in-water emulsions, respectively, and the separation efficiency was up to 99%. The antibacterial activity could be observed for the CS-PP composite membrane by the inhibition zone testing. In addition, the combination of meltblown and spunbond PP microfiber endowed the composite membrane with excellent tensile strength (up to 6.78\u202fMPa). All these results suggest the CS-PP composite membrane as a promising potential and energy-efficient separation membrane for the treatment of surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsion."}{"Crosslinked chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol)-based polyelectrolytes for proton exchange membranes ": "The preparation of polyelectrolytes based on crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and chitosan (CS) was considered as a feasible alternative to develop highly functionalised, cost-effective and eco-friendly membranes for proton exchange fuel cell technologies. CS/PVA-based membranes were combined with sulfosuccinic acid (SSA) as crosslinking and sulfonating agent, and glycerol (GL) to promote flexibility and favour their manageability. The chemical structure, the thermo-oxidative behaviour, the ethanol uptake, the electric, the proton conductivity, and the performance in direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) were assessed. In general, all the CS/PVA-based polyelectrolytes showed a synergetic increase of thermo-oxidative stability, appropriate absorption and diffusion of ethanol and good proton conductivity, suitable for the typical service conditions of fuel cells. The GL in the membranes reacted with SSA, reduced the ethanol absorption, the diffusion coefficient and the proton conductivity, but acted as a plasticiser that increased the ductile manageability of the polyelectrolytes to be mounted on the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA). Higher presence of CS and higher proportion of GL in the polyelectrolyte, improved the material performance in the DEFC. In particular, the crosslinked polyelectrolyte 40CS/PVA/SSA/20GLwith a 40%wt. of CS referred to PVA, and a 20%wt. of GL referred to CS, showed a suitable behaviour in the DEFC test, with a maximum value of power density of 746\u202fmW\u00b7cm\u22122."}{"Using grafted poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) for the compatibilization of thermoplastic starch-polylactic acid blends ": "Thermoplastic starch (S) and polylactic acid (PLA) blend films were obtained by melt blending and compression moulding using grafted polycaprolactone with maleic anhydride and/or glycidyl methacrylate (PCLMG or PCLG) as compatibilizers. The effect of both the PLA ratio in the blend (20 and 40% with respect to starch) and the amount of both compatibilizers (2.5 and 5%) on the film properties was analysed. Compatibilized blends presented a better dispersion of the PLA in the continuous starch phase, but the use of PCLG provoked a phase inversion in the matrix when 40% of the starch was substituted by PLA. The compatibilized blend films exhibited higher values of elastic modulus than pure starch films, but were less extensible. The use of compatibilizers did not affect the film's water vapour permeability, which was reduced by up to 33 or 50% for 20 and 40% PLA, respectively, although inverted films with 40% PLA and 5% PCLG, exhibited marked reduction (67%). Compatibilizers decreased the oxygen permeability of the films by about 50%, regardless of the ratio of PLA and the kind and amount of compatibilizer. Therefore, substituting 20% of the starch by PLA and incorporating 5% of PCLG would be a good strategy to obtain films useful for food packaging."}{"Blends of tri-block copolymers and addition curing resins: Influence of block copolymer-resin compatibility on toughness and matrix properties on toughenability ": "In any sort of rubber toughening of thermosets, there are two principal influences on toughness: Morphology of the elastomer particulate phase and toughenability of the matrix resin. These two factors are difficult to separate experimentally. A new approach is presented which is based on large numbers of data. By analysing property-property-relationships an attempt is made to identify generalizable rules. A tri-block copolymer (PCL-PDMSi-PCL) is analysed in detail: By varying the molecular weights of the compatible and incompatible blocks in two different epoxy resins the influence of morphology on toughness is studied. Linear (Tg and rubbery plateau modulus) and non-linear (yield stress and post-yield behaviour) matrix properties are examined for a larger number of resin/curing agent combinations toughened with three different toughening agents in order to elucidate which matrix property controls toughenability. The same resin/curing agent array was used to study the influence of matrix polarity on morphology and properties for one PCL-PDMSi-PCL tri-block-copolymer."}{"Aquafaba as an egg white substitute in food foams and emulsions: Protein composition and functional behavior ": "The ability of aquafaba to act as an egg white substitute was tested as effect of change in the level of pH and conductivity of aquafaba. The properties of aquafaba and egg white were analyzed by protein composition, dry matter content and protein concentration. Moreover, the zeta potential of aquafaba was analyzed. Foaming properties were studied by a hand shaken foam test. Emulsions were prepared by mixing either egg white or aquafaba with sunflower oil. Foam produced by either aquafaba or egg white showed distinct properties in foam capacity, foam volume and the liquid ratio in foam as function of time. However, the test of liquid drainage as function of time showed no difference between the two protein sources. Test of emulsifying properties showed more stable emulsions produced by centrifugated aquafaba compared to egg-white based emulsions. The measurements of emulsion stability were based on UV absorbance, emulsion particle size as well as rheological analyses. Aquafaba properties were not affected by increased level of NaCl in the foam and emulsifying tests conducted, however, changes in the level of pH affected all tests with exception of the foam capacity. The stability of emulsions based on aquafaba increased with increasing pH level evaluated by UV-absorbance and emulsion particle size opposite to the yield stress (Pa), which in general decreased with increasing pH level."}{"Oil-in-water Pickering emulsions via microfluidization with cellulose nanocrystals: 1. Formation and stability ": "Oil-in-water Pickering emulsions were successfully prepared via high-energy microfluidization using cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) as interfacial stabilizers. The influence of microfluidization pressure, CNC concentration, and oil type on droplet size and emulsion stability was determined. Under optimized homogenization conditions, CNC formed and stabilized emulsions based on corn, fish, sunflower, flax, orange, and MCT oils. The droplet size decreased with increasing microfluidization pressure from 9 to 17 kpsi, but then increased slightly at 19 kpsi. The creaming stability of the emulsions increased with CNC concentration, which was mainly attributed to the decrease in droplet size (mean particle diameter\u202f<\u202f1\u202f\u03bcm\u202fat CNC-to-oil ratios greater than 1:10) and slightly increased viscosity. The Pickering emulsions were stable to droplet coalescence, presumably due to strong electrostatic and steric repulsions between the lipid droplets carrying adsorbed nanoparticles. The Pickering emulsions had good stability over a range of environmental stresses: pH 3 to 10; NaCl \n                        \n                           \u2264\n                        \n                      100\u202fmM; temperature from 30 to 90\u202f\u00b0C. Droplet flocculation was, however, observed under more acidic conditions (pH 2) and at high ionic strength (200\u2013500\u202fmM NaCl), owing to electrostatic screening. Our results indicate that microfluidization is an effective method for forming CNC-stabilized Pickering emulsions suitable for utilization in the food industry."}{"Mixing animal and plant proteins: Is this a way to improve protein techno-functionalities? ": "In recent years, several research groups have focused on studying the partial replacement of animal proteins with plant proteins in food application, as an alternative to reduce animal protein consumption. This approach has proven to be useful in tracking synergistic techno-functional behaviors of these mixed protein systems with innovative potential. Certain mixed protein systems have been shown to be very efficient in modulating the texture of protein gels, ability to form low-cost edible films and to produce stable emulsions and foams. Thus, this review compiles the described mechanisms behind the behavior of animal and plant proteins in mixed systems, featuring the main strategies applied to enhance their techno-functional synergism and highlighting future challenges for this scientific field."}{"Comparative studies on the stabilization of pea protein dispersions by using various polysaccharides ": "The utilization of pea protein as an alternative to animal proteins for the production protein fortified foods and beverage products has recently gained tremendous interest due to the quality and health benefits associated with pea proteins. However, its use in food systems is often limited by technical issues such as the stability of pea protein dispersions (PPD). The objective of this study was to improve the physical stability of PPD by using corn fiber gum (CFG), high-methoxy pectin (HMP), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and konjac glucomannan (KGM). The stabilization mechanism of PPD by these four different polysaccharides was investigated at native pH (roughly 5.5\u20137.5) and acidified pH (ca. 3.5) using particle size, zeta potential, rheological and physical stability evaluations. All four polysaccharides effectively improved the stability of PPD at various levels, but the physical stability of PPD was highly dependent on the type and concentration of the polysaccharides as well as the pH. Electrostatic repulsion, steric hindrance and the high viscosity of continuous phase were the main contributions to the improvement in PPD stability. Overall, these results have significant implications for the development of protein-based beverages with improved physical stability. The findings derived from this research can provide valuable information that may increase the utilization of pea protein in the food industry."}{"Oil-in-water Pickering emulsions via microfluidization with cellulose nanocrystals: 2. In vitro lipid digestion ": "Bio-based engineered nanomaterials are being explored for their utilization within foods to improve quality and enhance functionality. In this study, we investigated the impact of a naturally-derived particle stabilizer, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), on the gastrointestinal fate and digestion of corn oil-in-water Pickering emulsions. A static 3-stage gastrointestinal tract (GIT) model was used to simulate the mouth, stomach and small intestine. The digestion of the CNC-coated lipid droplets was monitored by measuring the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the small intestine stage over time. The final extent of FFAs released was reduced by \n                        \n                           \u223c\n                        \n                     40% by using emulsions containing 10\u202fwt% of the dispersed phase, corn oil, stabilized with CNC (0.75\u202fwt% of the aqueous phase). Three main mechanisms are proposed for this effect: (1) the irreversible adsorption of CNC to the lipid droplet surfaces inhibited bile salt and lipase adsorption; (2) coalescence and flocculation of the lipid droplets reduced the surface area available for the bile salts and lipase to bind; and (3) accumulation of FFAs at the surfaces of the lipid droplets inhibited lipolysis. Our findings suggest that CNC can be used as a food-grade particle stabilizer to modulate the digestion of Pickering emulsified lipids, which is useful for the development of given functional foods."}{"Adsorption kinetics and foaming properties of soluble microalgae fractions at the air/water interface ": "Microalgae as a novel food ingredient are of increasing interest as they can be grown on non-arable land and fixate CO2 when grown photoautotrophically. Here, we employ proteins extracted from Arthrospira platensis biomass to be used for the stabilization of fluid interfaces, which is one of the most important techno-functional applications of proteins. Model foams were prepared from crude A. platensis powder and A. platensis isolate and whey protein isolate as a reference. The derived A. platensis isolate exceeded the overrun and the foam stability of whey protein isolate. The comparable low surface activity of crude A. platensis powder emphasizes the need for the extraction process. The neutral color of the A. platensis isolate indicates that the valuable natural pigments present in A. platensis were retained while achieving relevant techno-functional properties with the residual biomass. Physical treatment with nanosecond pulsed electric fields further increased the biomass yield without impeding the techno-functional properties of the derived isolates. Thus, protein extraction from microalgae biomass is an interesting approach to obtain techno-functional proteins and increase microalgae production efficiency."}{"Development of gluten free breads from Colocasia esculenta flour blended with hydrocolloids and enzymes ": "Colocasia esculenta, belonging to the Araceae family, represents an attractive alternative as gluten-free (GF) main ingredient owing its healthy pattern. The aim was to explore the GF breadmaking potential of Colocasia spp. cormels flour, thermally treated or blended with hydrocolloids (HPMC, xanthan gum, guar gum), enzymes (glucose oxidase or proteases) or potato starch. A total of eight formulations were used to obtain GF bread-like products. Resulting breads were characterized based on their technological quality, but also on their functional quality by in vitro starch digestion. Colocasia spp. cormels flour-based breads displayed similar quality parameters observed in previous reported GF formulations. The addition of an endoprotease allowed developing breads with higher specific volume, but the alcalase type protease increased crumb softness. In general, resulting GF breads contained higher SDS and RS fraction than RDS fractions. A better starch digestibility pattern than those previously reported in GF breads was also observed, which confirm the potential of Colocasia spp. cormels flour as novel nutritive source of GF flours."}{"Investigation of the structural and physical properties, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of pectin-konjac glucomannan composite edible films incorporated with tea polyphenol ": "Composite edible films of pectin (PEC) and konjac glucomannan (KGM) were incorporated with tea polyphenol (TP) to develop active food packaging. The effects of 1%\u20135% TP (w/w, on a dry basis of the weight of PEC and KGM) on the structural and physical properties, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the resultant PEC/KGM films were systematically evaluated. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) suggested the good compatibility of the components and the well-dispersion of TP in the matrix, due to the occurrence of hydrogen-bonding among them. The incorporation of TP significantly improved the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the films, while induced decreases in the transmittance, moisture content and elongation at break. In particular, addition of TP at appropriate levels remarkably increased the mechanical and water-resistant properties of the films. For example, the tensile strength and contact angle value of the films with 2% TP increased by 5.28\u202fMPa and 18.93\u00b0, respectively. However, overloading of TP in the composite films might produce some aggregations and thus have negative effects on their performance. In sum, the developed PEC/KGM/TP films possessed the potential to be applied as bioactive materials in food packaging sectors."}{"Effect of rice protein on the water mobility, water migration and microstructure of rice starch during retrogradation ": "The effects of rice protein on the water mobility, water migration and microstructure of rice starch during retrogradation were investigated by low field-nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The addition of rice protein limited the migration of water in rice starch gels and delayed the decrease of the spin-spin relaxation time during storage. The nuclear magnetic imaging showed that the gel without rice protein shrank when it was stored for 7 days, while the gel with rice protein did not change significantly. The SEM indicated that the gel with rice protein had a tighter and more uniform structure than the gel without rice protein. Microstructure analysis proved that adding rice protein could inhibit starch recrystallization, and the inhibitory effect was dependent on the concentration of rice protein. The inhibitory effect of rice protein on the retrogradation of rice starch was hypothesized to be mainly due to the addition of rice protein imported the space restriction, which reduced the cross-linking of starch molecules to form an ordered structure, inhibited the moisture migration in the gel, and enhanced the water-holding capacity of starch gels."}{"Transparent and antimicrobial cellulose film from ginger nanofiber ": "As demand on the safety and quality of the product in food packaging is increased, nanocellulose based transparent paper with resistance against microbial activity becomes more important. In this study, transparent cellulose film was prepared from ginger nanofiber with chemicals and ultrasonication. After purification using acid hydrolysis, ginger fiber had high cellulose content (88%). Ultrasonication of the suspension of the chemically treated fibers for 1\u202fh decreased their diameter to 54.3\u202fnm. Drying of the nano-sized fiber suspension resulted in a transparent film with 5\u202f\u03bcm thickness. This film transmitted 83.3% of the light at 650\u202fnm and showed antimicrobial activity. It had high thermal stability with the maximum decomposition temperature peak at 353\u202f\u00b0C. This was 17% higher than that of raw ginger fiber (302\u202f\u00b0C). The transparent film had a crystallinity index of 48%, and lower moisture resistance than film from chemically treated cellulose fiber. This study promoted transparent nanocellulose film with good antimicrobial properties from abundant and available ginger fibers."}{"Comprehensive characterization of active chitosan-gelatin blend films enriched with different essential oils ": "Natural extracts and plant essential oils (EOs) have long been recognized as valid alternatives to synthetic food additives owing to their proved wide-spectrum antimicrobial capacity. The main aim of this study was to characterize the physical, mechanical, water barrier, microstructural and antimicrobial properties of chitosan-gelatin blend films enriched with cinnamon, citronella, pink clove, nutmeg and thyme EOs. The film microstructure determined by scanning electron microscopy, showed that all active films had heterogeneous surface: in particular, films including cinnamon, nutmeg and thyme EOs showed remarkable pores on the surface. The possible interaction of chitosan-gelatin blend film with incorporated EOs was investigated using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Presence of new bands and changes in the FT-IR spectra confirmed intermolecular interactions between the chitosan-gelatin matrix and the EOs. The antimicrobial activity of films was determined using the disk diffusion assay. Active films inhibited the growth of four major food bacterial pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium and, among the tested EOs, thyme was the most effective (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The active films can be considered as effective barriers against UV light. The incorporation of EOs to the chitosan-gelatin film increased thickness, moisture content, water vapor permeability, b* and \u0394E* values (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) while it decreased L* value, light transparency and opacity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Overall, the characterization of functional properties revealed that chitosan-gelatin films incorporated with EOs could be used as environmentally friendly active food packaging with antimicrobial properties and potential to extend the shelf-life of food products."}{"Encapsulation of curcumin in zein/ caseinate/sodium alginate nanoparticles with improved physicochemical and controlled release properties ": "Curcumin-loaded zein nanoparticles that have a stabilized dual coating shell structure in combination with sodium caseinate (SC) and sodium alginate (SA) were fabricated and characterized. The mass ratio of each component, including the zein final concentration, the mass ratio of zein to SC, and the mass ratio of SC to SA influence the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles. The fluorescence spectrum confirmed that curcumin was encapsulated in the composite nanoparticles with an increase in the mass ratio of curcumin to zein, and the encapsulation efficiency of curcumin decreased. When coated with SA, there was a significantly improved encapsulation efficiency. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface hydrophobicity measurements indicated that hydrophilic SC and SA adsorbed on the surface of curcumin-loaded zein nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions to improve their water solubility. Encapsulation of curcumin in the composite nanoparticles not only significantly improved the photochemical stability and made it more effective in scavenging the 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH\u25cf) compared with vitamin C but also provided controlled release under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Therefore, SC-SA-stabilized zein nanoparticles are effective for improving the water solubility, photochemical stability and antioxidant activity of curcumin, and the prepared composite nanoparticles are expected to be used as a delivery carrier for chemically unstable hydrophobic active compounds in food and pharmaceutical industries."}{"0D/2D NiS2/V-MXene composite for electrocatalytic H2 evolution ": "As a member of the family of so-called MXenes, two-dimensional vanadium carbide (V2CT\n                        x\n                     , denoted as V-MXene) used in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still in the stage of theoretical study without significant experimental exploration. Here, we present the theoretical and experimental studies on the intrinsic structural and electrochemical properties of V-MXene-based hybrid (NiS2/V-MXene) to verify the possibility of using it as a potential electrocatalyst for HER. For the purpose of comparison, the most popular titanium carbide (Ti3C2T\n                        x\n                     , denoted as Ti-MXene) is studied too. As a proof of concept, NiS2/V-MXene and NiS2/Ti-MXene, are designed, prepared and experimentally explored. As expected, NiS2/V-MXene is proved to be a better electrocatalyst for HER than NiS2/Ti-MXene due to its faster electronic transfer and favorable interactions. The tight cover of NiS2 nanoparticles not only prevents V-MXene from restacking but also favors the exposure of extra active sites to accelerate the electrolysis process. Such a unique sandwich-like architecture is highly preferable to provide larger contact interface and more pathways for electron migration and mass diffusion during the electrolysis. Meanwhile, the predicted electron transfer from V-MXene to NiS2 is confirmed experimentally using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This research may provide a guide for the design and development of V-MXene-based electrocatalysts for HER, and expand their potential applications."}{"Metal-organic framework encapsulated single-atom Pt catalysts for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution ": "Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have emerged as a new research frontier in the catalytic community due to the utmost atom efficiency and tunable functionality in a wide variety of catalytic reactions. In the present work, a general operable synthetic platform for stable and well-defined positioned single-atom metal catalysts encapsulated in metal-organic framework (MOF) architecture was developed. Using the MOF-808 based single ion trap method, single metal ions were effectively captured by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) ligands, which were exchanged with the original formate ligands anchored at the Zr6 cluster metal nodes. Upon activated in hydrogen atmosphere at 200\u202f\u00b0C, the stable MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom metal catalysts with well-defined atomic positions were synthesized. The synthesized single-atom metal catalysts were confirmed using various experimental characterization techniques including high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy analysis, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform, as well as theoretical density functional theory calculations. As a demonstration case, it has been found that the as-synthesized MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst shows the excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (68.33\u202fmmol\u202fg\u22121\u202fh\u22121) and high stability. The apparent quantum efficiency reaches up to 67.6% at 420\u202fnm. This work not only provides a general and effective synthesis approach for preparing stable, uniformly distributed, MOF encapsulated single-atom metal catalysts such as Pd, Rh, Ru, Cu, Co, and Ni, but also sheds new insights into single-atom metal catalysts for photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production."}{"Formation of PdO on Au\u2013Pd bimetallic catalysts and the effect on benzyl alcohol oxidation ": "A series of catalysts consisting of gold\u2013palladium bimetallic nanoparticles (Au\u2013Pd NPs in the range of 1\u20136\u202fnm) anchored on foamlike mesoporous silica were used for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. A remarkable synergistic effect was observed on these Au\u2013Pd NP catalysts prepared by a one-pot method. Both experimental and theoretical study revealed a close relationship between the surface PdO species on the catalysts and their catalytic performance; that is, higher surface PdO content leads to lower catalytic activity. The surface content of PdO species on the catalysts could be tuned by controlling the Au/Pd ratios, because the formation of Au\u2013Pd alloy NPs and electron transfer between surface Au and Pd atoms prevented the oxidation of surface Pd and retarded the formation of PdO species. An optimal Au/Pd ratio of 1/4.5 on the foamlike mesoporous silica support was obtained, with nearly no surface PdO species formed, and resulted in the highest benzyl alcohol conversion of 96%. The bimetallic Au\u2013Pd catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activity for benzyl alcohol oxidation (TOF\u202f=\u202f50,000\u201360,000\u202fh\u22121) than the monometallic Pd catalyst (TOF\u202f=\u202f12,500\u202fh\u22121), on which surface Pd is easily oxidized to PdO. These results provide direct evidence for the synergistic effect of Au\u2013Pd bimetallic catalysts in benzyl alcohol oxidation."}{"Unveiling coke formation mechanism in MFI zeolites during methanol-to-hydrocarbons conversion ": "Coke formation over MFI zeolites of different crystallite sizes was rigorously investigated in methanol-to-hydrocarbon conversion (MTH). The key experimental idea was based on the fact that soft coke in the zeolite micropores (internal coke) could be selectively removed by thermal treatment under H2, while heavy coke at the zeolite external surface (external coke) remained intact. This enabled us to analyze the amount, composition, chemical nature, and deactivating effects of internal and external cokes, separately. As the mass transfer of hydrocarbons was retarded with increasing zeolite crystallite size, an aromatic-based catalytic cycle became dominant in MTH compared to an olefin-based cycle. Consequently, methylated benzene intermediates were accumulated within the zeolite micropores. These methylated benzenes could also act as coke precursors and polymerize to form internal coke within the micropores. Aromatic products that diffused out of zeolite micropores could also be condensed at the external surface of the zeolite crystallites. Once the carbon deposits were formed at the external zeolite surface, the external coke continued to grow even non-catalytically by the thermal reaction with the methylated benzenes. Different zeolite catalysts and reaction times affected only the relative amounts of internal and external cokes, but not their respective chemical natures. The internal coke appeared to have the H/C ratio of 1.26 and a density of 1.0\u202fg\u202fcm\u22123, while the external coke had much lower H/C ratio (0.28) and higher density (1.5\u202fg\u202fcm\u22123). We propose that internal coke is likely to have the polymeric structures of the methylated acenes (i.e., linearly fused aromatic rings such as benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene) connected via methylene bridges. On the other hand, the external coke is highly polyaromatic with many fused rings. In terms of catalyst deactivation, the internal coke proved to be much more detrimental than the external coke."}{"Catalytic consequences of ultrafine Pt clusters supported on SrTiO3 for photocatalytic overall water splitting ": "The metal cluster size in supported metal catalysts impacts the oxidation state of the metal atoms, coordination capability, and finally the catalytic activity\u2014especially when the number of atoms becomes countable. The correlation between metal oxidation state and its catalytic consequences for ultrafine Pt was studied for photocatalytic overall water splitting using a Pt/SrTiO3 (photo)catalyst. A distinctive change in catalytic behavior and oxidation state was observed below 100\u202fPt-atom clusters at \u223c2\u202fnm. Combining density functional theory (DFT) and experimental characterizations including X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), the smaller Pt clusters obtained by the surface organometallic route (under 100\u202fPt atoms) were predominantly oxidized and selectively performed photocatalytic water splitting selectively without activation of the water-forming back-reaction from H2 and O2. When the Pt clusters obtained by classical impregnation were larger than 2\u202fnm, they remained metallic (Pt0) and were active for both water splitting and the competing thermal water formation back reaction. In addition, Pt0 clusters are poisoned in the presence of CO, whereas highly dispersed ultra-fine oxidized Pt clusters are insensitive to CO. This paper presents evidence of ultrafine PtO\n                        x\n                      (below approximately 2\u202fnm clusters) that are insensitive to coordination of various gas identities (H2, O2, CO), resulting in efficient and selective photocatalytic overall water splitting."}{"Impregnation of semiconductor CdS NPs in MOFs cavities via double solvent method for effective photocatalytic CO2 conversion ": "Construction of MOF-based photocatalysts is promising work due to their considerable active sites and flexible structures. Herein, we present a facile double solvent and in-situ-growth strategy to integrate CdS NPs with MIL-101(Cr) to engineer CdS/MIL-101(Cr) composite photocatalyst. As-prepared CdS/MIL-101(Cr) samples were characterized by TEM, SEM, BET, EPR, XPS, TPC and ESI. CdS/MIL-101(Cr) exhibited remarkable enhanced activity for conversion CO2 to CO under visible light irradiation, and the 36% CdS/MIL-101(Cr) showed the optimal performance in the all samples. The superior activity was attributed to following factors. The strong interaction between CdS and MIL-101(Cr) promoted the separation and transferring of the photogenerated charge carriers. A higher utilization efficiency of photoelectrons could be achieved with the MIL-101(Cr) possessing multiple absorptions and active sites for the photoreduction of CO2. Also, CdS/MIL-101(Cr) provided a special transferring path for photoelectrons, from CdS to MIL-101(Cr), then to photoreduction of CO2, which could be certified by the calculation of energy-level and the survey of \n                        \n                     O2\n                     \u2013 of CdS and MIL-101(Cr)."}{"Se-modified polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets with improved photocatalytic activities ": "The carbon nitride (CN) with selenide (Se) modification and porous thin nanosheet structure (m-CNNSs) has been successfully presented via an effective two-step continuous thermal treatment method. The as-prepared m-CNNSs show a photocatalytic H2 generation and CO2 reduction performance under visible light, the apparent quantum yield of H2 generation (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f420\u202fnm) reached 8.1%. This improved photocatalytic performance originates from the large surface areas and porous nanostructure that accelerated separation of photoexcited charge carriers and promoted mass-transfer process. Particularly, the formation of the Se modified in the thin CN sheets further endow it with reduced band gap, more exposed active edges, and extended visible light absorption range. This work not only presents a simple strategy to enhance the photocatalytic performance for CN, but also opens ups a new pathway for the rational preparation of effective polymeric photocatalysts by harnessing the synergistic effects to simultaneously optimize the electronic and frame structure of polymeric photocatalysts."}{"A combo Zr-HY and Al-HY zeolite catalysts for the one-pot cascade transformation of biomass-derived furfural to \u03b3-valerolactone ": "A highly efficient catalyst system was developed for the one-pot transformation of furfural to \u03b3-valerolactone (GVL) in an open system. The cascade of two Meerwein Ponndorf Verley (MPV) reductions, ring-opening and esterification reactions was catalyzed by a physical mixture of Zr- and Al-HY zeolites where the proportion and strength of Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acid sites could be independently optimized. The excellent activity of Zr-HY zeolites for the MPV reduction of furfural and levulinate ester with 2-pentanol as hydrogen donor was attributed to the larger pore size of HY-zeolites and stronger Lewis acidic sites compared to Zr-Beta. Al-HY zeolites were more effective as Br\u00f8nsted acid than Al-Beta because they converted furfuryl ether to levulinate ester rather than to \u03b2-angelica lactone. The dual catalytic system comprising Zr-HY (Si/Zr 20) and Al-HY (Si/Al 6) exhibited remarkably high catalytic activity with GVL yields of 85% after only 5\u202fh at 120\u202f\u00b0C."}{"Origin and prevention of broad particle size distributions in carbon-supported palladium catalysts prepared by liquid-phase reduction ": "Carbon-supported palladium (Pd/C) catalysts often display broad or multimodal Pd particle size distributions detrimental for their performance. Therefore, the formation of large particles during preparation should be better understood and avoided. We prepared catalysts with up to 10\u202fwt% Pd supported on oxygen-functionalized carbon nanotubes and activated carbon via liquid-phase reduction. It was inferred that small Pd particles (\u223c1\u202fnm) were formed from Pd ions adsorbed on the carbon. At higher loadings, up to 65% of the Pd ended up in larger particles (>10\u202fnm) probably formed from Pd ions in solution, lowering the Pd-normalized activity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde 4-fold compared to samples with small particles only. Three key factors were identified for preparing Pd/C catalysts with exclusively \u223c1\u202fnm Pd particles: a support with a high density of acid sites and high specific surface area, and a metal loading at molar ratio Pd/acid sites <0.5."}{"Tuning CO2 hydrogenation selectivity via metal-oxide interfacial sites ": "CO2 hydrogenation over ZrO2-supported NiFe catalysts is investigated to illustrate the role of Fe in controlling the activity and selectivity, and to reveal the structure-function relationship between metal-oxide interfaces and catalytic selectivities. The Ni-ZrO2 interfaces and Ni-FeO\n                        x\n                      interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for the methanation reaction and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, respectively, using combined in-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques. The reaction mechanisms of CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 on the Ni-ZrO2 interfacial sites and to CO on the Ni-FeO\n                        x\n                      interfacial sites are further revealed by combined in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the binding energy of absorbed CO (*CO) is a key descriptor to predict CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: weak interaction (e.g., Ni-FeO\n                        x\n                      interfaces) promotes *CO desorption to increase CO selectivity, while moderate interaction (e.g., Ni-ZrO2 interfaces) facilitates further hydrogenation of *CO to produce CH4."}{"Size, nanostructure, and composition dependence of bimetallic Au\u2013Pd supported on ceria\u2013zirconia mixed oxide catalysts for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol ": "A bimetallic Au\u2013Pd catalyst supported on ceria\u2013zirconia with Au:Pd molar ratio 0.8 has been synthesized using a simultaneous deposition\u2013precipitation method and oxidized at 250, 450, and 700\u202f\u00b0C in order to modify its particle size, nanostructure, and composition. Combined X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis clearly evidence that the bimetallic Au\u2013Pd catalyst oxidized at 250\u202f\u00b0C is made up of a mixture of monometallic Au and Pd and bimetallic Au\u2013Pd nanoparticles with Au:Pd ratios varying over a wide range. Increasing oxidation temperature leads to a stronger interaction between Au and Pd. Meanwhile, a slight increase of particle size and a narrowing of the Au:Pd ratio in the bimetallic nanoparticles take place. Compared with titania and activated carbon supports, the resistance against sintering at high temperatures of Au\u2013Pd metal particles supported on ceria\u2013zirconia is proven to be higher. A synergistic effect has been observed for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol on these catalysts. The catalytic activity decreases only slightly after oxidation at 450\u202f\u00b0C. However, oxidation at 700\u202f\u00b0C results in much lower catalytic activity. Migration of Pd onto Au particles during oxidation of benzyl alcohol enhances the catalytic activity of a physical mixture of monometallic Au and Pd supported on ceria\u2013zirconia catalysts. This fact, jointly with an analysis of the intrinsic activity, reveals the influence of the actual nature of Au\u2013Pd interactions in the bimetallic particles, which points to higher activity of Au@Pd or AuPd@Pd nanostructures on ceria\u2013zirconia supports."}{"Selective conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to diketone derivatives over Beta zeolite-supported Pd catalysts in water ": "Conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in water to the linear diketone derivatives 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione (HHD) and 2,5-hexanedione (HXD) was investigated over a series of Beta zeolite-supported transition metal catalysts (Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Pd). Their catalytic performance was tested in a batch stirred reactor (T\u202f=\u202f110\u202f\u00b0C, PH2\u202f=\u202f20\u202fbar) with Pd showing the highest activity and selectivity to HHD and HXD. The effects of Pd particle size, zeolite Si/Al ratio and reaction conditions (T\u202f=\u202f80\u2013155\u202f\u00b0C, PH2\u202f=\u202f5\u201360\u202fbar) were also investigated. The incorporation of Pd into Beta zeolite by the deposition-coprecipitation method produced the most efficient catalyst, affording complete HMF conversion (T\u202f=\u202f110\u202f\u00b0C, PH2\u202f=\u202f60\u202fbar) predominantly to HHD (68% selectivity) and HXD (8% selectivity). The combination of a bifunctional acid/redox solid catalyst and water enhances the hydrolytic ring-opening and subsequent hydrogenation of the furan ring. Catalytic activity can be partially restored by a simple regeneration treatment. This work establishes a catalytic route to produce valuable diketone derivatives from renewable furanic platform sources in water."}{"Decoupling structure-sensitive deactivation mechanisms of Ir/IrOx electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction ": "Deterioration of intrinsic activity of Ir-based electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has received much less attention compared to the metal dissolution. Combining chronoamperometry with operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, we show that the deactivation via active site phase transformation from hydrous Ir oxide/hydroxide into anhydrous Ir oxide, is concomitant with the dissolution-induced loss of electrochemical surface area. The relative contributions from these deactivation paths were found to be structure sensitive. Systematic evaluation of different Ir-based catalysts at identical electro-oxidative conditions showed that hydrous IrOx with structural short-range order exhibited an initial minor degradation of intrinsic activity but the most significant dissolution after the extended stability test. In contrast, newly-reported Ir superstructures with higher crystallinity and larger proportion of low-index crystal terminations exhibited enhanced resistance to dissolution but a major degradation of intrinsic activity, as the performance-relevant hydrous oxide/hydroxide species developed only on the surface of metallic Ir. The Ir/IrOx catalyst regeneration was demonstrated."}
