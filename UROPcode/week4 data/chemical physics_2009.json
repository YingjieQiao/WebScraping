{"Direct in situ measurements of Li transport in Li-ion battery negative electrodes ": "We describe the first direct in situ measurements of Li transport in an operating cell. Motion of the lithiation front in the graphite electrode suggests that transport could be controlled by liquid-phase diffusion. The electrochemical (current\u2013voltage) data are successfully modeled with a diffusion equation that contains no material or microstructural information. The model is only qualitatively successful in predicting observed Li transport rate data, suggesting that microstructural information is required and that the actual process is more complex than simply diffusion. The technique can provide data for studying Li plating and Li dendrite growth, both of which can cause battery degradation."}{"Chemical engineering in an unsustainable world: Obligations and opportunities ": "Human society faces a set of unprecedented challenges emanating from the unsustainable nature of the current societal model. The creation of a new sustainable societal construct is required, essentially adopting a needs based approach over one based on ever increasing consumption. Failure to achieve this will result in the widespread destruction of our increasingly stressed environment followed quickly by inevitable collapse of society as we know it, both socially and economically.\n                  Technology alone is insufficient to meet the challenges at hand; ecological, social and economic considerations must be incorporated through a multi-faceted and multi-disciplinary approach. Because chemical engineers possess a core set of threshold concepts which are central to a sustainable society, and because engineers will ultimately help design any new society, they bear a moral and ethical responsibility to play an active and indeed central role in its development. A new engineering paradigm is required therefore, whereby sustainability becomes the context of engineering practice. To achieve this, a sustainability informed ethos must prevail throughout engineering curricula. Both professional institutions and educators bear responsibility in ensuring this happens without delay. Some key threshold concepts are presented here to demonstrate how this can be advanced through the chemical engineering curriculum."}{"Effect of temperature and nitrogen concentration on the growth and lipid content of Nannochloropsis oculata and Chlorella vulgaris for biodiesel production ": "A possible source of biological material for the production of biodiesel is represented by microalgae, in particular by their lipid content. The aim of the present work was to study of the effects of temperature and nitrogen concentration on the lipid content of Nannochloropsis oculata and Chlorella vulgaris in view of their possible utilization as novel raw materials for biodiesel production. In addition, various lipid extraction methods were investigated. The extracted lipids were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed by gravimetric and gas chromatographic methods, respectively, in order to check their suitability according to the European standards for biodiesel. The lipid content of microalgae was strongly influenced by the variation of tested parameters; indeed, an increase in temperature from 20 to 25\u00b0C practically doubled the lipid content of N. oculata (from 7.90 to 14.92%), while an increase from 25 to 30\u00b0C brought about a decrease of the lipid content of C. vulgaris from 14.71 to 5.90%. On the other hand, a 75% decrease of the nitrogen concentration in the medium, with respect to the optimal values for growth, increased the lipid fractions of N. oculata from 7.90 to 15.31% and of C. vulgaris from 5.90 to 16.41%, respectively."}{"Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF) for biological assessment of rivers and lakes in Flanders (Belgium) ": "The European Water Framework Directive requires that member states assess all their surface waters based on a number of biological elements, including macroinvertebrates. Since 1989, the Flemish Environment Agency has been using the Belgian Biotic Index for assessing river water quality based on macroinvertebrates. Throughout the years, the Belgian Biotic Index has proven to be a reliable and robust method providing a good indication of general degradation of river water and habitat quality. Since the Belgian Biotic Index does not meet all the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, a new index, the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF) for evaluating rivers and lakes was developed and tested. This index was developed in order to provide a general assessment of ecological deterioration caused by any kind of stressor, such as water pollution and habitat quality degradation. The MMIF is based on macroinvertebrate samples that are taken using the same sampling and identification procedure as the Belgian Biotic Index. The index calculation is a type-specific multimetric system based on five equally weighted metrics, which are taxa richness, number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, number of other sensitive taxa, the Shannon\u2013Wiener diversity index and the mean tolerance score. The final index value is expressed as an Ecological Quality Ratio ranging from zero for very bad ecological quality to one for very good ecological quality. The MMIF correlates positively with dissolved oxygen and negatively with Kjeldahl nitrogen, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrite, total phosphorous, orthophosphate and biochemical and chemical oxygen demand. This new index is now being used by the Flemish Environment Agency as a standard method to report about the status of macroinvertebrates in rivers and lakes in Flanders within the context of the European Water Framework Directive."}{"Pit lakes of the Central German lignite mining district: Creation, morphometry and water quality aspects ": "About 140 pit lakes exist in Central Germany. These have resulted from lignite mining and are important parts of the post-mining landscape in the Central German lignite mining district. Their water quality is mainly influenced by the consequences of pyrite oxidation, i.e., acidification or results of natural or artificial neutralization. The major way of filling as well as a cheap and successful measure against acidification was the diversion of river water into the lakes or their filling with neutral water from mines still operating. Eutrophication, contamination by industrial pollutants and infection with pathogens imported with river water were found to be unimportant threats for the pit lakes in the Central German lignite mining district. Intrusion of naturally saline groundwater from deeper underground resulted in some cases in elevated concentrations of sodium chloride and in meromixis. The diverse uses of the lakes (e.g. recreation, nature conservation, water management) indicate that the pit lakes fulfil widely the typical functions of lakes in a landscape. The creation, the current state of water quality and lessons learned in water quality management are reported upon for the pit lakes of the Central German lignite mining district."}{"Microwave heating processes involving carbon materials ": "Carbon materials are, in general, very good absorbents of microwaves, i.e., they are easily heated by microwave radiation. This characteristic allows them to be transformed by microwave heating, giving rise to new carbons with tailored properties, to be used as microwave receptors, in order to heat other materials indirectly, or to act as a catalyst and microwave receptor in different heterogeneous reactions. In recent years, the number of processes that combine the use of carbons and microwave heating instead of other methods based on conventional heating has increased. In this paper some of the microwave-assisted processes in which carbon materials are produced, transformed or used in thermal treatments (generally, as microwave absorbers and catalysts) are reviewed and the main achievements of this technique are compared with those obtained by means of conventional (non microwave-assisted) methods in similar conditions."}{"North Atlantic climate variability: The role of the North Atlantic Oscillation ": "Marine ecosystems are undergoing rapid change at local and global scales. To understand these changes, including the relative roles of natural variability and anthropogenic effects, and to predict the future state of marine ecosystems requires quantitative understanding of the physics, biogeochemistry and ecology of oceanic systems at mechanistic levels. Central to this understanding is the role played by dominant patterns or \u201cmodes\u201d of atmospheric and oceanic variability, which orchestrate coherent variations in climate over large regions with profound impacts on ecosystems. We review the spatial structure of extratropical climate variability over the Northern Hemisphere and, specifically, focus on modes of climate variability over the extratropical North Atlantic.\n                  A leading pattern of weather and climate variability over the Northern Hemisphere is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO refers to a redistribution of atmospheric mass between the Arctic and the subtropical Atlantic, and swings from one phase to another producing large changes in surface air temperature, winds, storminess and precipitation over the Atlantic as well as the adjacent continents. The NAO also affects the ocean through changes in heat content, gyre circulations, mixed layer depth, salinity, high latitude deep water formation and sea ice cover. Thus, indices of the NAO have become widely used to document and understand how this mode of variability alters the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems.\n                  There is no unique way, however, to define the NAO. Several approaches are discussed including both linear (e.g., principal component analysis) and nonlinear (e.g., cluster analysis) techniques. The former, which have been most widely used, assume preferred atmospheric circulation states come in pairs, in which anomalies of opposite polarity have the same spatial structure. In contrast, nonlinear techniques search for recurrent patterns of a specific amplitude and sign. They reveal, for instance, spatial asymmetries between different phases of the NAO that are likely important for ecological studies.\n                  It also follows that there is no universally accepted index to describe the temporal evolution of the NAO. Several of the most common measures are presented and compared. All reveal that there is no preferred time scale of variability for the NAO: large changes occur from one winter to the next and from one decade to the next. There is also a large amount of within-season variability in the patterns of atmospheric circulation of the North Atlantic, so that most winters cannot be characterized solely by a canonical NAO structure. A better understanding of how the NAO responds to external forcing, including sea surface temperature changes in the tropics, stratospheric influences, and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, is crucial to the current debate on climate variability and change."}{"Pulse proteins: Processing, characterization, functional properties and applications in food and feed ": "Pulses (pea, chickpea, lentil, bean) are an important source of food proteins. They contain high amounts of lysine, leucine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and arginine and provide well balanced essential amino acid profiles when consumed with cereals and other foods rich in sulphur-containing amino acids and tryptophan. The protein content of most pulse legumes fall within the range of 17\u201330% (d.w.b.). Apart from their nutritional properties, pulse proteins also possess functional properties that play an important role in food formulation and processing. Examples of such functional properties include solubility, water and fat binding capacity and foaming. Various research studies indicate that some functional properties of pulse proteins may be comparable to those of other frequently used proteins such as soy and whey. The functional properties of pulse proteins have been exploited in the preparation and development of products such as bakery products, soups, extruded products and ready to eat snacks. The growing body of research on the health benefits associated with the consumption of pulses has increased interest in developing innovative technologies to expand the use of pulses in food products. At the same time, there are growing global food security challenges and protein malnutrition continues to be a problem in many countries around the world. Pulses, especially when blended with cereal proteins, may offer a promising alternative source for nutritional and functional proteins. This review provides an overview of the characteristics of pulse proteins, current and emerging techniques for their fractionation, their major functional properties and opportunities for their use in various applications."}{"Clays and oxide minerals as catalysts and nanocatalysts in Fenton-like reactions \u2014 A review ": "Advanced oxidation processes (AOP), involving the generation of highly oxidizing radical species, have attracted much attention because of their potential in eliminating recalcitrant organic pollutants from different environmental matrices. Among the most investigated AOP is the Fenton reaction in which hydroxyl radicals (HO) are generated through the catalytic reaction of Fe(II)/Fe(III) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The use of clays and iron-oxide minerals as catalysts of Fenton-like reactions is a promising alternative for the decontamination of soils, groundwaters, sediments, and industrial effluents. The low cost, abundance, and environmentally friendly nature of clay minerals and iron oxides are an added advantage. Additionally, the introduction of nanoparticles in heterogeneous catalytic processes has led to appreciable improvements in catalytic efficiency. Here we review the application of clays and iron-oxide minerals as supports or active catalysts in Fenton-like reactions, and summarize the latest advances in nanocatalyst development. We also evaluate the potential use of allophane nanoparticles, coated with iron oxides, as catalysts of Fenton-like reactions."}
