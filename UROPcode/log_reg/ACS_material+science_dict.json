{"Reversible 2D Phase Transition Driven By an Electric Field: Visualization and Control on the Atomic Scale_2015": "We report on a reversible structural phase transition of a two-dimensional system that can be locally induced by an external electric field. Two different structural configurations may coexist within a CO monolayer on Cu(111). The balance between the two phases can be shifted by an external electric field, causing the domain boundaries to move, increasing the area of the favored phase controllable both in location and size. If the field is further enhanced new domains nucleate. The arrangement of the CO molecules on the Cu surface is observed in real time and real space with atomic resolution while the electric field driving the phase transition is easily varied over a broad range. Together with the well-known molecular manipulation of CO adlayers, our findings open exciting prospects for combining spontaneous long-range order with man-made CO structures such as \u201cmolecule cascades\u201d or \u201cmolecular graphene\u201d. Our new manipulation mode permits us to bridge the gap between fundamental concepts and the fabrication of arbitrary atomic patterns in large scale, by providing unprecedented insight into the physics of structural phase transitions on the atomic scale.", "Sustainable Polymers in the Organic Chemistry Laboratory: Synthesis and Characterization of a Renewable Polymer from \u03b4-Decalactone and l-Lactide_2013": "The importance of green syntheses and sustainable polymers is highlighted in a new experiment developed for incorporation into the introductory organic chemistry laboratory curriculum. \u03b4-Decalactone, a naturally occurring cyclic ester used by the food and flavor industry for its coconut fragrance and taste, is polymerized under acidic conditions with a diol initiator. The solvent-free, room-temperature reaction conditions result in a viscous homopolymer from which the catalyst is easily removed. Subsequent chain extension of this homopolymer with the renewable monomer l-lactide, followed by purification, isolation, and annealing in an aluminum pan, affords a block copolymer product as a transparent, flexible film. Well-resolved resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum of the individual polymer repeat units facilitate quantitative analysis of polymer composition and molecular weight determination. This experiment introduces students to structures and fundamental concepts of polymer chemistry and exemplifies modern advances in sustainable materials.", "Topography-Correlated Confocal Raman Microscopy with Cylindrical Vector Beams for Probing Nanoscale Structural Order_2014": "Cylindrical vector beams, such as radially or azimuthally polarized doughnut beams, are combined with topography studies of pentacene thin films, allowing us to correlate Raman spectroscopy with intermolecular interactions depending on the particular pentacene polymorph. Polarization-dependent Raman spectra of the C\u2013H bending vibrations are resolved layer by layer within a thin film of \u223c20 nm thickness. The variation of the Raman peak positions indicates changes in the molecular orientation and in the local environment at different heights of the pentacene film. With the assistance of a theoretical model based on harmonic oscillator and perturbation theory, our method reveals the local structural order and the polymorph at different locations within the same pentacene thin film, depending mainly on its thickness. In good agreement with the crystallographic structures reported in the literature, our observations demonstrate that the first few monolayers grown in a structure are closer to the thin-film phase, but for larger film thicknesses, the morphology evolves toward the crystal-bulk phase with a larger tilting angle of the pentacene molecules against the substrate normal.", "Nitrogen-Coordinated Boroxines Enable the Fabrication of Mechanically Robust Supramolecular Thermosets Capable of Healing and Recycling under Mild Conditions_2019": "The fabrication of mechanically robust polymeric materials capable of self-healing and recycling remains challenging because the mobility of polymer chains in such polymers is very limited. In this work, mechanically robust supramolecular thermosets capable of healing physical damages and recycling under mild conditions are fabricated by trimerization of bi-(ortho-aminomethyl-phenylboronic acid)- and tri-(ortho-aminomethyl-phenylboronic acid)-terminated poly(propylene glycol) oligomers (denoted as Bi-PBA-PPG and Tri-PBA-PPG, respectively). The resultant supramolecular thermosets are cross-linked by dynamic covalent bonds of nitrogen-coordinated boroxines. The mechanical properties of the supramolecular thermosets can be systematically tailored by varying the ratios between Tri-PBA-PPG and Bi-PBA-PPG, which changes the cross-linking density of nitrogen-coordinated boroxines and the topology of the supramolecular thermosets. The mechanically strongest supramolecular thermosets with a molar ratio of Tri-PBA-PPG to Bi-PBA-PPG being 1:2 have a glass transition temperature of \u223c36 \u00b0C, a tensile strength of \u223c31.96 MPa, and a Young\u2019s modulus of \u223c298.5 MPa. The high reversibility of nitrogen-coordinated boroxines and the flexibility of poly(propylene glycol) chains enable the supramolecular thermosets with the strongest mechanical strength to be highly efficiently healed at 55 \u00b0C and recycled under a pressure of 4 MPa at 60 \u00b0C to regain their original mechanical strength and integrity.", "A Simple Photocell To Demonstrate Solar Energy Using Benign Household Ingredients_2013": "A laboratory exercise for the construction of a dye-sensitized solar cell using everyday household and benign products has been developed.

Nevertheless, this method was usually limited to small substrates, since PLD deposition on large substrate areas results in severe lateral inhomogeneity. A few technical solutions for this problem have been suggested, including the use of different designs of masks, which were meant to prevent inhomogeneity in the thickness, density, and oxidation state of a layer, while only the composition is allowed to be changed. In this study, a possible way to take advantage of the large scale deposition inhomogeneity is demonstrated, choosing an iron oxide PLD-deposited library with continuous compositional spread (CCS) as a model system. An Fe2O3\u2013Nb2O5 library was fabricated using PLD, without any mask between the targets and the substrate. The library was measured using high-throughput scanners for electrical, structural, and optical properties. A decrease in electrical resistivity that is several orders of magnitude lower than pure \u03b1-Fe2O3 was achieved at \u223c20% Nb\u2013O (measured at 47 and 267 \u00b0C) but only at points that are distanced from the center of the PLD plasma plume. Using hierarchical clustering analysis, we show that the PLD inhomogeneity can be used as an additional degree of freedom, helping, in this case, to achieve iron oxide with much lower resistivity.", "Hybrid Light\u2013Matter States in a Molecular and Material Science Perspective_2016": "Conspectus\nThe notion that light and matter states can be hybridized the way s and p orbitals are mixed is a concept that is not familiar to most chemists and material scientists. Yet it has much potential for molecular and material sciences that is just beginning to be explored. For instance, it has already been demonstrated that the rate and yield of chemical reactions can be modified and that the conductivity of organic semiconductors and nonradiative energy transfer can be enhanced through the hybridization of electronic transitions. The hybridization is not limited to electronic transitions; it can be applied for instance to vibrational transitions to selectively perturb a given bond, opening new possibilities to change the chemical reactivity landscape and to use it as a tool in (bio)molecular science and spectroscopy. Such results are not only the consequence of the new eigenstates and energies generated by the hybridization. The hybrid light\u2013matter states also have unusual properties: they can be delocalized over a very large number of molecules (up to ca. 105), and they become dispersive or momentum-sensitive. Importantly, the hybridization occurs even in the absence of light because it is the zero-point energies of the molecular and optical transitions that generate the new light\u2013matter states. The present work is not a review but rather an Account from the author\u2019s point of view that first introduces the reader to the underlying concepts and details of the features of hybrid light\u2013matter states. It is shown that light\u2013matter hybridization is quite easy to achieve: all that is needed is to place molecules or a material in a resonant optical cavity (e.g., between two parallel mirrors) under the right conditions. For vibrational strong coupling, microfluidic IR cells can be used to study the consequences for chemistry in the liquid phase. Examples of modified properties are given to demonstrate the full potential for the molecular and material sciences. Finally an outlook of future directions for this emerging subject is given.", "Molecules, Materials, Medicines (M3): Linking Molecules to Medicines through Pharmaceutical Material Science_2015": 0, "Co3O4 Based All-Oxide PV: A Numerical Simulation Analyzed Combinatorial Material Science Study_2016": "Here we investigate the impact of four different metal back contacts on the photovoltaic (PV) performance of Co3O4 thin film all-oxide photovoltaic cells. A combinatorial TiO2|Co3O4 heterojunction thin film device library was made with thickness gradients for both metal oxide layers. Grids of four different metal back contacts were then deposited on top of these layers. A significant effect of the metal back contacts on the final photoconversion performance has been observed by combinatorial PV measurements. We analyze these results via advanced numerical simulations and different scenarios in order to explain the recombination mechanisms at the different back contacts. We conclude that the nature of the back contact material controls the density of surface states and, therefore, the undesirable surface recombination at the absorber\u2013back contact interface.", "Material Science by Design.

The Art of Shaping Liquids into Spheres_2014": "Employing avant-garde cuisine techniques, in particular sodium alginates, liquid food can be shaped into spheres, thereby conferring to the former original and sometimes unexpected forms and textures. To achieve this result, rational understanding of the science that underlies food physical chemistry is of paramount importance. In this contribution, the process of spherification is dissected for the first time at the atomic level by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that a thin membrane consisting of intertwined alginate chains forms in an aqueous solution containing calcium ions, thereby encapsulating in a sphere the aliment in its liquid state. They also show why the polysaccharide chains will not cohere into such a membrane in a solution of sodium ions. Analysis of the trajectories reveals the emergence of so-called egg-box spatial arrangements, which connect the alginate chains by means of repeated chelation of one calcium ion by two carboxylate groups. Free-energy calculations delineating the formation of these egg-box structures further illuminate the remarkable stability of such tridimensional organizations, which ensures at room temperature the spontaneous growth of the polysaccharide membrane. Spherification has been also examined for liquid aliments of different nature, modeled by charged, hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. The membrane-encapsulated food is shaped into robust and durable spheres, irrespective of the liquid core material. By reconciling the views of spherification at small and large scales, the present study lays the groundwork for the rational design of innovative cooking techniques relevant to avant-garde cuisine.", "Combinatorial Material Science and Strain Engineering Enabled by Pulsed Laser Deposition Using Radially Segmented Targets_2018": "Vertical composition gradients of ternary alloy thin films find applications in numerous device structures.

In this study, we propose an approach based on a single elliptically segmented PLD target suited for the epitaxial growth of vertically graded layers. The composition of the thin films can be varied by a simple adjustment of the position of the PLD laser spot on the target surface. We demonstrate this principle for the MgxZn1\u2013xO alloy system. Such vertically composition-graded MgxZn1\u2013xO thin films exhibit high optical quality and a well-defined Mg-content for each layer. No signs of interdiffusion of Mg-atoms between the layers have been found.

After this first burst of research activity, challenging the boundaries of CuAAC in terms of attainable polymer constructs, ongoing method development, and implementation, in response to the need for metal-free alternatives, resulted in a valuable toolbox of \u201cclick\u201d-inspired conjugation methods.

While some embrittlement mechanisms have been proposed (especially for Fe), the behavior of dissolved hydrogen and impact on material properties is not fully understood in many systems relevant to hydrogen technologies. Here, hydrogen binding in pure Pd and alloys of Pd with Ag and Au was examined at a fundamental level from first principles in an attempt to elucidate how hydrogen-induced failure can be reduced in Pd alloys relevant to hydrogen production technologies. We show that PdAg and PdAu alloys (where the alloying metal is under 25%) likely suppress hydrogen-induced mechanical failure due to their reduced hydrogen solubility relative to pure Pd. This conclusion is based on our findings that alloying leads to higher vacancy stabilization and lower elastic constants upon hydrogen dissolution than for pure Pd but to unfavorable hydrogen dissolution beyond 25 at. %. The lowering of hydrogen solubility is strongly related to the combination of a lowering of the overall metal d-band center through alloy incorporation as well as changes to the metal Pauli repulsion factor, which is herein related to the metal matrix coupling element. Additionally, hydrogen loading and unloading were sequentially interrogated to mimic stress in storage materials. We find that permanent plastic deformation to the system is pronounced for alloyed systems, which in some cases made subsequent loading more favorable.", "Palladium Catalyzed C\u2013I and Vicinal C\u2013H Dual Activation of Diaryliodonium Salts for Diarylations: Synthesis of Triphenylenes_2017": "Using the synthetic strategy of palladium-catalyzed dual activation of both C\u2013I and vicinal C\u2013H bonds of diaryliodonium salts, we report an approach for direct diarylations of 2-bromobiphenyls or bromobenzenes.

The primary amine is a key functional group and one of the most important nucleophiles and bases used in all of synthetic chemistry. Therefore, tremendous interest in the synthesis of molecules containing primary amines and strategies to devise chemical reactions to react with primary amines has been at the core of chemical research. In particular, primary amines are a ubiquitous functional group found in biological systems as free amino acids, as key side chain lysines in proteins, and in signaling molecules and metabolites and are also present in many natural product classes. Due to its abundance, the primary amine is the most convenient functional group handle in molecules for ligation to other molecules for a broad range of applications that impact all scientific fields. Because of the primary amine\u2019s central importance in synthetic chemistry, acid\u2013base chemistry, redox chemistry, and biology, many methods have been developed to efficiently react with primary amines, including activated carboxylic acids, isothiocyanates, Michael addition type systems, and reaction with ketones or aldehydes followed by in situ reductive amination. Herein, we introduce a new traceless, high-yield, fast click-chemistry method based on the rapid and efficient trapping of amine groups via a functionalized dialdehyde group. The click reaction occurs in mild conditions in organic solvents or aqueous media and proceeds in high yield, and the starting dialdehyde reagent and resulting dialdehyde click conjugates are stable. Moreover, no catalyst or dialdehyde-activating group is required, and the only byproduct is water. The initial dialdehyde and the resulting conjugate are both straightforward to characterize, and the reaction proceeds with high atom economy. To demonstrate the broad scope of this new click-conjugation strategy, we designed a straightforward scheme to synthesize a suite of dialdehyde reagents. The dialdehyde molecules were used for applications in cell-surface engineering and for tailoring surfaces for material science applications.

Because of the unique partial wetting and nonwetting characteristics of PFPEs, we were able to go beyond the usual molding and imprint lithography approaches and have created a technique called PRINT (Particle [or Pattern] Replication In Nonwetting Templates).\nPRINT is a distinctive \u201ctop-down\u201d fabrication technique capable of generating isolated particles, arrays of particles, and arrays of patterned features for a plethora of applications in both nanomedicine and materials science. A particular strength of the PRINT technology is the high-resolution molding of well-defined particles with precise control over size, shape, deformability, and surface chemistry. The level of replication obtained showcases some of the unique characteristics of PFPE molding materials. In particular, these materials arise from very low surface energy precursors with positive spreading coefficients, can be photocured at ambient temperature, and are minimally adhesive, nonswelling, and conformable. These distinctive features enable the molding of materials with unique attributes and nanometer resolution that have unprecedented scientific and technological value. For example, in nanomedicine, the use of PFPE materials with the PRINT technique allows us to design particles in which we can tailor key therapeutic parameters such as bioavailability, biodistribution, target-specific cell penetration, and controlled cargo release.

The intrinsic biorecognition potential of nucleic acids combined with advanced properties of the locked nucleic acids (LNAs) provide opportunities to develop new nanomaterials and devices like sensors, aptamers, and machines. In this Account, we describe recent research on preparation and investigation of the properties of LNA/DNA hybrids containing functionalized 2\u2032-amino-LNA nucleotides.\nBy application of different chemical reactions, modification of 2\u2032-amino-LNA scaffolds can be efficiently performed in high yields and with various tags, postsynthetically or during the automated oligonucleotide synthesis. The choice of a synthetic method for scaffolding along 2\u2032-amino-LNA mainly depends on the chemical nature of the modification, its price, its availability, and applications of the product. One of the most useful applications of the product LNA/DNA scaffolds containing 2\u2032-amino-LNA is to detect complementary DNA and RNA targets. Examples of these applications include sensing of clinically important single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imaging of nucleic acids in vitro, in cell culture, and in vivo. According to our studies, 2\u2032-amino-LNA scaffolds are efficient within diagnostic probes for DNA and RNA targets and as therapeutics, whereas both 2\u2032-amino- and isomeric 2\u2032-\u03b1-l-amino-LNA scaffolds have promising properties for stabilization and detection of DNA nanostructures. Attachment of fluorescent groups to the 2\u2032-amino group results in very high fluorescent quantum yields of the duplexes and remarkable sensitivity of the fluorescence signal to target binding. Notably, fluorescent LNA/DNA probes bind nucleic acid targets with advantages of high affinity and specificity. Thus, molecular motion of nanodevices and programmable self-assembly of chemically modified LNA/DNA nanomaterials can be followed by bright fluorescence signaling from the functionalized LNA units. Another appealing aspect of the amino-LNA scaffolds is specific targeting of nucleic acids and proteins for therapeutic applications. 2\u2032-Amino-LNA/DNA conjugates containing peptide and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) groups are promising in this context as well as for advanced imaging and diagnostic purposes in vivo. For imaging applications, photostability of fluorescence dyes is of crucial importance. Chemically stable and photostable fluorescent PAH molecules attached to 2\u2032-amino functionality of the 2\u2032-amino-LNA are potent for in vitro and in vivo imaging of DNA and RNA targets.\nWe believe that rational evolution of the biopolymers of Nature may solve the major challenges of the future material science and biomedicine.

The design of new (Z)-/(E)- isomers and study of their properties, behaviors, and interactions are crucially important in molecular engineering. However, difficulties with their separation and structure confirmation limit their structural diversity and functionality in scope. In the work described herein, we successfully synthesized pure isomers of ureidopyrimidinone-functionalized tetraphenylethenes ((Z)-TPE-UPy and (E)-TPE-UPy), featuring both the aggregation-induced emission characteristic of tetraphenylethene and the supramolecular polymerizability of ureidopyrimidinone. Their structures were confirmed by 2D COSY and NOESY NMR spectroscopies. The two isomers show distinct fluorescence in the aggregate state: (Z)-TPE-UPy exhibits green emission, while its (E)-counterpart is blue-emitting. The cavity formed by the two ureidopyrimidinone groups of (Z)-TPE-UPy makes it suitable for Hg2+ detection, and the high-molecular-weight polymers prepared from (E)-TPE-UPy can be used to fabricate highly fluorescent fibers and 2D/3D photopatterns from their chloroform solutions.", "Biodegradable Polymeric Materials in Degradable Electronic Devices_2018": "Biodegradable electronics have great potential to reduce the environmental footprint of devices and enable advanced health monitoring and therapeutic technologies.

Polymers that can disintegrate without full chemical breakdown (type I), as well as those that can be recycled into monomeric and oligomeric building blocks (type II), will be discussed. Type I degradation is typically achieved with engineering and material science based strategies, whereas type II degradation often requires deliberate synthetic approaches. Notably, unconventional degradable linkages capable of maintaining long-range conjugation have been relatively unexplored, yet may enable fully biodegradable conductors and semiconductors with uncompromised electrical properties. While substantial progress has been made in developing degradable device components, the electrical and mechanical properties of these materials must be improved before fully degradable complex electronics can be realized.", "Investigation of the Iron\u2013Sulfide Phase Transformation in Nanoscale_2014": "Iron sulfides, polymorphous substances, play a key role in geology, marine systems, material science, and the life sciences. The crystal structures and phase transitions of iron\u2013sulfur compounds are complex and elusive. In this study, we fabricated most known iron sulfides, mackinawite was the first reaction product, which declined gradually until it disappeared; the following Cubic FeS and troilite presented a characteristic of layer growth. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we directly observed for the first time the transition of cubic FeS into greigite and that of mackinawite into greigite. Greigite, which is extremely unstable in an oxygen-free H2S environment, was found to play an intermediate role in the transition into a more stable phase.", "PITCHER PLANT INSPIRES SUPER SLIPPERY SURFACE_2011": "WHEN INSECTS land on the walls of Nepenthes pitcher plants, they soon meet their doom, thanks to a surface that causes them to slip into the digestive juices at the plant bloom\u2019s bottom. By mimicking the pitcher plant\u2019s slick means of gathering a meal, Joanna Aizenberg and colleagues at Harvard University have created an omniphobic material that repels simple liquids such as water and hydrocarbons, complex fluids such as crude oil and blood, and even solids.

Regrettably, supramolecular chemistry and material science benefited far less from these recent developments. Here we expand the scope of SRM to photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) imaging of synthetic nanostructures that are highly dynamic in organic solvents. Furthermore, we characterize the photophysical properties of commonly used photoactivatable dyes in a wide range of solvents, which is made possible by the addition of a tiny amount of an alcohol. As proof-of-principle, we use PALM to image silica beads with radii close to Abbe\u2019s diffraction limit.

Both firms agree that AkzoNobel should move ahead with plans to spin off its specialty chemical business. Elliott is AkzoNobel\u2019s largest shareholder. Starting in April, the fund pressed AkzoNobel to agree to a takeover by the paint company PPG Industries. When AkzoNobel refused, Elliott sued for the right to dismiss the firm\u2019s chair, Antony Burgmans. The three-month truce will head off further litigation. It includes the nomination of three new board members supported by both companies, one of whom is Patrick Thomas, CEO of Covestro, the former material science business of Bayer.

Toward an Interplay between Magnetism, Conductivity, and Nonlinear Optics_2001": "This review is devoted to hybrid materials made of organic quadratic nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores embodied in various inorganic environments. In the first section are reported systems in which the inorganic moiety is a transparent mineral network (e.g., silica, zirconium phosphate, etc.) exhibiting good transparency, crystal stability, and mechanical hardness, but none of the electronic properties usually associated with material science. The second section focuses on NLO chromophores inserted into inorganic magnetic phases (more precisely, Mn2P2S6 and [MnIICrIII(ox)3]- layered structures). The issue related to possible synergies between optical and magnetic behavior (Faraday effect) is adressed.

Multilayered structures, being planar or concentric, are now emerging as major players at the forefront of research. Raman spectroscopy is a well-established characterization technique for carbon nanomaterials and is being developed for layered materials.

These magnetic materials efficiently adsorb contaminants from water and can be easily removed from the medium by a simple magnetic separation process. The magnetic composites can be prepared by a simple procedure based on the precipitation of magnetic iron oxides from Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts and NaOH on activated carbon or clay (two excellent adsorbents). The prepared materials can be used in various experiments such as: Harvesting the Magnetic Composite, Oil Spill Remediation, Adsorption of Metal Ions Contaminants onto Clay Composites, and Adsorption of Organic Contaminants onto Activated Carbon Composites.

Using near ambient pressure core level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we directly detected a low surface coverage of adsorbed HCl at 253 K in both molecular and dissociated states. Depth profiles derived from XPS data indicate the results as physisorbed molecular HCl at the outermost ice surface and dissociation occurring upon solvation deeper in the interfacial region. Complementary X-ray absorption measurements confirm that the presence of Cl\u2013 ions induces significant changes to the hydrogen bonding network in the interfacial region.

Despite the intensive studies in the infrared range, high-spatial-resolution and high-sensitivity imaging for compositional identification in the visible range is rarely exploited. In this work, we present a gap-plasmon-enhanced imaging approach based on photothermal-induced resonance (PTIR) for nanoscale chemical identification. With this approach, we experimentally obtained a high spatial resolution of \u223c5 nm for rhodamine nanohill characterization and achieved monolayer sensitivity for mapping the single-layer chlorophyll-a islands with the thickness of only 1.9 nm. We also successfully characterized amyloid fibrils stained with methylene blue dye, indicating that this methodology can be also utilized for identification of the radiation-insensitive macromolecules.

The ability to program synthetic materials to intrinsically respond to environmental changes in a similar manner has the potential to revolutionize material science. By designing polymeric devices capable of responsively changing shape or behavior based on information encoded into their structure, we can create functional physical behavior, including a shape-memory and an actuation capability. Here we highlight the stimuli-responsiveness and shape-changing ability of biological materials and biopolymer-based materials, plus their potential biomedical application, providing a bioperspective on shape-memory materials. We address strategies to incorporate a shape-memory (actuation) function in polymeric materials, conceptualized in terms of its relationship with inputs (environmental stimuli) and outputs (shape change). Challenges and opportunities associated with the integration of several functions in a single material body to achieve multifunctionality are discussed.

Rheological approaches to shelf-life and freshness may range from a simple squeezing technique to advanced oscillatory methodologies probing material microstructure. As rheology relates to consumer perceptions of quality and freshness, a more common sensory term, texture, is employed. Changes in texture and stability during storage have been recognized as important factors influencing consumer acceptability of many food products. Texture is a complex attribute of food quality and can only be measured directly by sensory evaluation. However, many instrumental methods are used to measure mechanical properties of foods that are, up to a certain extent, related to sensory characteristics. Large strain methods such as puncture, penetration, bending, tension, shear, compression, and texture profile analysis are commonly used to evaluate freshness and textural changes of foods with respect to storage conditions. For fluid foods, various rheological techniques evaluate yield stress and shear viscosity, providing information about pourability, thickness, and dispersion or emulsion stability over time. Small strain methods, specifically dynamic oscillatory shear and mechanical analyses, are useful in probing microstructure, viscoelastic properties, and phase transitions in food materials. This chapter reviews rheological methods applicable to assessment of freshness and textural stability of foods.", "Synthesis of Oligo(ethylenediamino)-\u03b2-Cyclodextrin Modified Gold Nanoparticle as a DNA Concentrator_2007": "A novel oligo(ethylenediamino)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin-modified gold nanoparticle (OEA-CD-NP) was synthesized as a vector for DNA binding and comprehensively investigated by means of absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopies as well as transmission electron microscopy, and its plasmid transfection efficiency as a carrier into cultivated cells in vitro was also evaluated. Possessing many hydrophobic cavities at the outer space, OEA-CD-NP may have a capability of carrying biological and/or medicinal substrates into cells, which will make it potentially applicable in many fields of material science and biological technology. In contrast with OEA-CD-NP, the oligo(ethylenediamino)-lipoic amido-modified gold nanoparticle (OEA-L-NP) without CD was synthesized to investigate the interaction with DNA.

Because of their specific photophysical and photochemical properties, they find versatile applications from material science to medicine. However, a deep mechanistic understanding is needed to be able to predict the properties of such azoswitches. In particular, the effect of different substituents on the azo chromophore is of great interest as they are often crucial for embedding the molecular switch into a system of interest. Herein, we provide a detailed spectroscopic and computational study on the influence of substituents on 3-phenylazoindoles chosen as models.

However, it is difficult to selectively synthesize these compounds due to the multiple reactive sites in aryl fragments. In this work, we prepared the first fully fluorinated porous aromatic framework (PAF). Its \u2212C\u2013F bond and hierarchical porosity have great benefits for PAF functionalization. After being decorated with different cyclodextrins (CDs), CD-PAF materials can incorporate diverse aryl compounds to protect their ortho sites from being attacked to produce para-substituted molecules. This selectivity obviously increased with a decrease in the substrate size (from 0.97 to 0.41 nm). In addition, the CD-PAFs can undergo long-term use in both chlorination and bromination.", "POLYMERS GE Plastics adjusts partnerships prior to sale to SABIC_2007": "GE Plastics is buying out partners in two joint ventures in advance of its sale to Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC), which is expected to be completed later this quarter.\nGE is purchasing Bayer Material-Science's 50% stake in Exatec, a joint venture formed in 1998 to promote the use of polycarbonate in automotive windows.\nExatec developed a plasma-enhanced vapor-deposition process intended to coat polycarbonate windows and give it abrasion resistance comparable to glass.

This work demonstrates that 13C solid-state NMR (SSNMR) of paramagnetic systems under very fast magic angle spinning (VFMAS) (spinning speed of 20 kHz or higher) provides exceptionally sensitive means to probe small structural difference among polymorphs of paramagnetic complexes in noncrystalline solids, including drugs and materials containing paramagnetic metal ions. 13C VFMAS SSNMR experiments and corresponding ab initio shift calculations for Cu(II)(8-quilinolinol)2, anticancer agents, show that \u03b1- and \u03b2-forms of this compound can be easily distinguished by notable difference in paramagnetic relaxation times and hyperfine shifts.

These organelles have been explored meticulously using genetic, structural, and biochemical tools; however, their application in material science has not been explored much. In this study, we have used the external shell surface of MCP as a scaffold for the fabrication of gold nanoparticles displayed in 3D. This resulted in the formation of a protein scaffolded gold nanoparticle shell enclosing an active enzyme cluster. The surface scaffolded gold nanoparticles demonstrated standard catalysis, while the internal enzyme cluster of the MCPs demonstrated no loss in activity due to this fabrication. Under ambient conditions for in vitro inorganic reaction, the shell proteins sturdily maintain the barrier between the luminal enzyme and the surface inorganic catalysts and preserve the functionality of the core enzyme cluster. The MCP-AuNPs hybrid catalysts inspire a pristine class of resources that can be used in a chemical reaction condition without perturbing core biological environment for enzymatic activity.

Both fluorescence and ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) absorption of the polymer dots showed a sensitive and reversible response to pH. The mechanism of pH-dependent optical properties was investigated. The existence of two proton-responsive functional groups (phenolic hydroxyl groups and amine groups) on the polymer dot surface is crucial. The pH-dependent fluorescence is ascribed to electron transfer, which is controlled by the protonation degree of amine groups, while the pH-dependent UV\u2013vis absorption is induced by ionization of phenolic hydroxyl groups. Based on the pH-mediated optical properties, a colorimetric and fluorescent dual-signal pH sensor and multiple logic gates were developed.

There are only a few procedures and techniques to control precipitation (Liesegang) patterns in gel media (e.g., using an electric field, varying the initial concentration of the electrolytes). However, those methods provide just a limited degree of freedom. Here, we provide a robust and transparent way to control and engineer Liesegang patterns by varying gel concentration and inducing impurity by addition of gelatin to agarose gel.

Fe(CO){CO(CH2)n\u22121CH3}(Cp)(PPh3) molecules (FpCn) with a Fp head and alkyl tail are water-insoluble. FpC1 aggregates in water precipitated in hours, whereas the hydrophobic interaction (HI) of long alkyl groups drove FpCn (n = 6\u201318) molecules assemble into colloids in water. The alkyl tails interacted and stretched as indicated by IR analysis, while the separation of Fp head groups at the surface of colloids was indicated by the redox behavior of Fe elements. The molecules therefore arranged into a proposed \u201cY\u201d shape with hydration cavities. The IR and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses indicated that the longer the alkyl tail, the larger the hydration cavity and the stronger the HI.

By assigning the three color channels of the imaging detector (red, green, and blue) to the plasmon resonance wavelengths of the nanostructure, the quantitative display of orientation improved by 200%. The reduced symmetry of a gold nanorod Dolmen structure further improved the sensitivity of colorimetric orientation by a factor of 2 due to the comparative intensities of the resonances.

This platform, combining soft lithography with generic amyloid monomer inks (consisting of genetically engineered biofilm proteins dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol), along with methanol-assisted curing, enables the spatially controlled deposition and in situ reassembly of amyloid monomers. The resulting patterned structures exhibit spectacular chemical and thermal stability and mechanical robustness under harsh conditions. The PAMs can be programmed for a vast array of multilevel functionalities, including anchoring nanoparticles, enabling diverse fluorescent protein arrays, and serving as self-supporting porous sheets for cellular growth. This PAM platform will not only drive innovation in biomanufacturing but also broaden the applications of patterned soft architectures in optics, electronics, biocatalysis, analytical regents, cell engineering, medicine, and other areas.", "Fractionation of Soda Pulp Lignin in Aqueous Solvent through Membrane-Assisted Ultrafiltration_2018": "An industrial wheat straw lignin was fractionated by a multistep process involving microfiltration followed by two membrane-assisted ultrafiltration steps starting from an aqueous solvent solution. The parent lignin and the different fractions were fully characterized in terms of chemical composition and physicochemical properties by gel permeation chromatography, gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results show that the proposed process allows us to selectively control the molar mass distribution of the fractions and the related dependent properties. This strategy offers a better understanding of the structural complexity of soda pulp raw lignin and emerges as an essential tool for lignin valorization in the context of material science and preparative organic chemistry.", "Principles and Applications of Halogen Bonding in Medicinal Chemistry and Chemical Biology_2012": "Halogen bonding has been known in material science for decades, but until recently, halogen bonds in protein\u2013ligand interactions were largely the result of serendipitous discovery rather than rational design. In this Perspective, we provide insights into the phenomenon of halogen bonding, with special focus on its role in drug discovery. We summarize the theoretical background defining its strength and directionality, provide a systematic analysis of its occurrence and interaction geometries in protein\u2013ligand complexes, and give recent examples where halogen bonding has been successfully harnessed for lead identification and optimization. In light of these data, we discuss the potential and limitations of exploiting halogen bonds for molecular recognition and rational drug design.", "A Fluorogenic Probe for the Copper(I)-Catalyzed Azide\u2212Alkyne Ligation Reaction:\u2009 Modulation of the Fluorescence Emission via 3(n,\u03c0*)\u2212(\u03c0,\u03c0*) Inversion_2004": "Chemoselective ligation reactions represent a powerful approach for labeling of proteins or small molecules in a biological environment. We report here a fluorogenic probe that is activated by click chemistry, a highly versatile bio-orthogonal and chemoselective ligation reaction which is based on the azide moiety as the functional group. The electron-donating properties of the triazole ring that is formed in the course of the coupling reaction was effectively utilized to modulate the fluorescence output of an electronically coupled coumarin fluorophore. Under physiological conditions the probe is essentially nonfluorescent and undergoes a bright emission enhancement upon ligation with an azide. Time-resolved emission spectroscopy and semiempirical quantum-mechanical calculations suggest that the fluorescence switching is due to an inversion of the energy ordering of the emissive 1(\u03c0,\u03c0*) and nonemissive 3(n,\u03c0*) excited states. The rapid kinetics of the ligation reaction render the probe attractive for a wide range of applications in biology, analytical chemistry, or material science.", "Fluorous Solid-Phase Extraction Technique Based on Nanographite Fluoride_2017": "Fluorous solid-phase extraction (FSPE) has been employed to isolate target compounds from complex chemical or biological samples in many research areas. However, the lack of efficient and economical available perfluorinated materials impeded its development. In this study, we present a novel nanographite fluoride-based fluorous solid-phase extraction (GF-FSPE) as a replacement of commercially available cartridge-based FSPE, which showed remarkable selectivity, low LOD, high post enrichment recovery, and large enrichment capacity. To demonstrate the potency of GF-FSPE, it was designed and successfully applied to isolate cysteine-containing peptide subsets from complex protein samples to improve the proteome coverage. Additionally, since graphite fluoride was inexpensive and highly commercialized, this study was expected to promote the popularization of FSPE in both chemical and biological separations as well as encourage the synthesis and broaden the application of highly fluorinated carbon fluoride in material science.", "Real-Space Investigation of Energy Transfer through Electron Tomography_2017": "We herein report the first real-space investigation of F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in two different types of quantum dot (QD) supramolecular assemblies by observing their three-dimensional (3D) configurations through high-resolution electron tomography. Owing to its critical role in photosynthesis, artificial light-harvesting antennas, and investigation of protein\u2013protein interactions, the mechanism of FRET has been intensively studied by monitoring its excited-state dynamics via various spectroscopic techniques. The utilized electron tomography technique allowed the direct localization of 3D coordinates of individual QDs in self-assembled nanostructures and theoretical estimation of the FRET efficiency of a single fluorophore, domain, or supramolecular assembly. Moreover, the experimental value of the FRET efficiency determined by fluorescence spectroscopy was in good agreement with the magnitude obtained via electron tomography. We believe that the described strategy can be used in single-molecule FRET studies and will help to create a new bridge between material science and molecular/supramolecular photochemistry.", "The Synergy between Metal Facet and Oxide Support Facet for Enhanced Catalytic Performance: The Case of Pd\u2013TiO2_2016": "The demand for catalyst with higher activity and higher selectivity is still a central issue in current material science community. On the basis of first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the catalytic performance of the Pd\u2013TiO2 hybrid nanostructures can be selectively promoted or depressed by choosing the suitable shaped Pd and TiO2 nanocrystals. To be more specific, the catalytic activities of Pd nanoparticles enclosed by (100) or (111) facets can be promoted more significantly when dosed on the TiO2(001) than on TiO2(101) under irradiation. Such theoretical prediction has then been further verified by the experimental observations in which the Pd(100)\u2013TiO2(001) composites exhibit the highest catalytic performance toward the activation of oxygen among all the other shaped hybrid nanostructures. As a result, the selection of facets of support materials can provide an extra tuning parameter to control the catalytic activities of metal nanoparticles. This research opened up a new direction for designing and preparing catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance.", "concentrates_1998": "The author describes a course which is structured with a view toward fulfilling the following three objectives which he feels are both realistic and extremely important for the students of today: teaching the fundamentals in a non- mathematical manner; the role existing theories play in the creation of new theories; and the consequences of the use and abuse of science.", "Cu-Catalyzed Click Reaction in Carbohydrate Chemistry_2016": "Cu(I)-catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC), popularly known as the \u201cclick reaction\u201d, serves as the most potent and highly dependable tool for facile construction of simple to complex architectures at the molecular level. Click-knitted threads of two exclusively different molecular entities have created some really interesting structures for more than 15 years with a broad spectrum of applicability, including in the fascinating fields of synthetic chemistry, medicinal science, biochemistry, pharmacology, material science, and catalysis. The unique properties of the carbohydrate moiety and the advantages of highly chemo- and regioselective click chemistry, such as mild reaction conditions, efficient performance with a wide range of solvents, and compatibility with different functionalities, together produce miraculous neoglycoconjugates and neoglycopolymers with various synthetic, biological, and pharmaceutical applications. In this review we highlight the successful advancement of Cu(I)-catalyzed click chemistry in glycoscience and its applications as well as future scope in different streams of applied sciences.", "Optimization of Modal and Material Dispersions in High-Bandwidth Graded-Index Polymer Optical Fibers_1997": "The optimum refractive-index distribution of the high bandwidth graded-index polymer optical fiber (GI POF) was clarified by consideration of both modal and material dispersions. The ultimate bandwidth achieved by the POF is investigated by a quantitative estimation of the material dispersion as well as the modal dispersion. The results indicated that even if the refractive-index distribution is tightly controlled, the bandwidth of the poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-base GI POF was dominated by the material dispersion when the required bit rate becomes larger than 4 Gb/s for 100-m transmission. It was also confirmed that the material dispersion strongly depends on the matrix polymer and that the fluorinated polymer whose material dispersion (-0.078 ns/nm \u00b7 km) is lower than that of poly methyl methacrylate (-0.305 ns/nm \u00b7 km) allows for a 10 Gb/s transmission rate in 100 m link.", "Quantum Mechanical Design and Structures of Hexanuclear Sandwich Complex and Its Multidecker Sandwich Clusters (Li6)n([18]Annulene)n+1 (n = 1\u20133)_2012": "By means of density functional theory, a hexanuclear sandwich complex [18]annulene-Li6-[18]annulene which consists of a central Li6 hexagon ring and large face-capping ligands, [18]annulene, is designed and investigated. The large interaction energy and HOMO\u2013LUMO gap suggest that this novel charge-separated complex is highly stable and may be experimentally synthesized. In addition, the stability found in the [18]annulene-Li6-[18]annulene complex extends to multidecker sandwich clusters (Li6)n([18]annulene)n+1 (n = 2\u20133). The energy gain upon addition of a [18]annulene-Li6 unit to (Li6)n\u22121([18]annulene)n is pretty large (96.97\u201398.22 kcal/mol), indicating that even larger multideckers will also be very stable. Similar to ferrocene, such a hexanuclear sandwich complex could be considered as a versatile building block to find potential applications in different areas of chemistry, such as nanoscience and material science.", "Controlled Construction of Nanostructured Organic\u2013Inorganic Hybrid Material Induced by Nanocellulose_2017": "Sticky rice lime mortar (SRLM) is a widely used lime-based gelled material in ancient China. Sticky rice plays an important role in the formation of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material. Inspired by this, a nanostructured organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material (NOHM) was constructed based on the regulation of nanocellulose (NCC) on the crystallization of calcium carbonate. The used NCC was prepared by a green way via simultaneous ball milling and phosphotungstic acid catalyzed hydrolysis. The characteristics of the prepared NOHM were explored to gain insight into the interaction of NCC and mineral during the mineralization of calcium carbonate. The results indicate that nanocellulose plays a crucial role in the formation of nanostructured organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material, which not only induces and regulates the mineralization process of calcium carbonate crystals but also affects the morphology and size of the formed calcium carbonate crystals. The mechanical strength and durability of NOHM were significantly improved with the regulation of NCC. The results not only suggest new hypotheses about the role of polysaccharide in the mineralization process but also serve to shed light on the formation process of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material regulated by polysaccharide.", "Real-Time Monitoring of Hierarchical Self-Assembly and Induction of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Achiral Luminogens_2019": "Constructing artificial helical structures through hierarchical self-assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are important, and they help gain insight from the structures, processes, and functions from the biological helices and facilitate the development of material science and nanotechnology. Herein, the two enantiomers of chiral Au(I) complexes (S)-1 and (R)-1 were synthesized, and they exhibited impressive spontaneous hierarchical self-assembly transitions from vesicles to helical fibers. An impressive chirality inversion and amplification was accompanied by the assembly transition, as elucidated by the results of in situ and time-dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope imaging. The two enantiomers could serve as ideal chiral templates to co-assemble with other achiral luminogens to efficiently induce the resulting co-assembly systems to show circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Our work has provided a simple but efficient way to explore the sophisticated self-assembly process and presented a facile and effective strategy to fabricate architectures with CPL properties.", "Dual Colorimetric and Fluorescent Authentication Based on Semiconducting Polymer Dots for Anticounterfeiting Applications_2017": "Semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) have recently emerged as a novel type of ultrabright fluorescent probes that can be widely used in analytical sensing and material science. Here, we developed a dual visual reagent based on Pdots for anticounterfeiting applications. We first designed and synthesized two types of photoswitchable Pdots by incorporating photochromic dyes with multicolor semiconducting polymers to modulate their emission intensities and wavelengths. The resulting full-color Pdot assays showed that the colorimetric and fluorescent dual-readout abilities enabled the Pdots to serve as an anticounterfeiting reagent with low background interference. We also doped these Pdots into flexible substrates and prepared these Pdots as inks for pen handwriting as well as inkjet printing. We further applied this reagent in printing paper and checks for high-security anticounterfeiting purposes. We believe that this dual-readout method based on Pdots will create a new avenue for developing new generations of anticounterfeiting technologies.", "Synthesis, Characterization, and Reactivity of a Hexane-Soluble Silver Salt_2007": "Metal phosphonates are an important class of compounds with applications in chemistry and material science. Despite an intense amount of research over the last few decades, the solution characterization of these species remains limited owing to poor solubility in common organic solvents. This article describes the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of a rare class of organosoluble metal phosphonate complexes. The synthesis of Ag[P(O)(OC8H17)2] is straightforward and can be accomplished in a single three-hour laboratory period with minimal preparation. To the best of our knowledge, Ag[P(O)(OC8H17)2] exhibits the largest 1JAgP coupling constants (107Ag, 109Ag) ever reported, which clearly establishes that the bonding mode of the phosphonate fragment is through phosphorus and not through oxygen.", "\u201cNaked\u201d Iron-5,10,15-triphenylcorrole on Cu(111): Observation of Chirality on a Surface and Manipulation of Multiple Conformational States by STM_2008": "A new member of the metalloporphyrinoid class, the one-carbon short corrole, has been developed in the past decade to a very accessible and easily tunable compound with many potential applications in material science and catalysis. Other than for the structurally related iron porphyrins, all attempts to prepare and study the \u201cnaked\u201d iron triphenylcorrole molecule (FeTPC) in bulk have failed. Here, we demonstrate stabilization of FeTPC as adsorbates on a surface. Local investigations by means of scanning tunneling microscopy reveal that along with the adsorption of FeTPC in a saddle conformation, surface induced chirality is the result. Using scanning tunneling microscopy as a local manipulation tool, individual molecules can be controllably switched between different orientations and conformations. Even conformations which are unfavorable during the adsorption process are feasible. The presented experiments demonstrate that metalated corroles are a highly interesting class of metalloporphyrinoids for local investigations but, in comparison with the well established class of porphyrins, add an additional degree of experimental freedom via chirality.", "Perdeuterated 2,2\u2032-Bipyridine-6,6\u2032-dicarboxylate: An Extremely Efficient Sensitizer for Thulium Luminescence in Solution_2013": "Lanthanoid luminescence has become an important pillar for many modern photonics applications such as bioanalytical research or functional material science. So far, however, thulium despite having one of the most interesting photophysics among the lanthanoids has suffered from extremely low luminescence efficiencies in molecular complexes with organic sensitizer ligands. This has greatly hampered the investigation and application of thulium emission in solution. Here, the discovery of a powerful sensitizer for thulium photoluminescence is reported. The corresponding thulium complex exhibits emission efficiencies (quantum yield \u03a6 > 0.12%; lifetime \u03c4obs = 4.6 \u03bcs; brightness \u03b5\u03a6 > 30 M\u20131 cm\u20131) and can even be detected at low micromolar concentrations in high-phonon solvents like water without the need for laser excitation.", "Geometric Shape Regulation and Noncovalent Synthesis of One-Dimensional Organic Luminescent Nano-/Micro-Materials_2017": "Noncovalent synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) organic nano-/micro-materials with controllable geometric shapes or morphologies and special luminescent and electronic properties is one of the greatest challenges in modern chemistry and material science. Control of noncovalent interactions is fundamental for realizing desired 1D structures and crucial for understanding the functions of these interactions. Here, a series of thiophene-fused phenazines composed of a halogen-substituted \u03c0-conjugated plate and a pair of flexible side chains is presented, which displays halogen-dependent 1D self-assemblies. Luminescent 1D twisted wires, straight rods, and zigzag wires, respectively, can be generated in sequence when the halogen atoms are varied from the lightest F to the heaviest I. It was demonstrated that halogen-dependent anisotropic noncovalent interactions and mirror-symmetrical crystallization dominated the 1D-assembly behaviors of this class of molecules. The methodology developed in this study provides a potential strategy for constructing 1D organic materials with unique optoelectronic functions.", "Hybrid Organic Semiconductors Including Chalcogen Atoms in \u03c0-Conjugated Skeletons. Tuning of Optical, Redox, and Vibrational Properties by Heavy Atom Conjugation_2006": "In this work, the interactions between heteroatoms (S, Se, and Te) and conjugated skeletons are analyzed. The study is carried out by using electronic absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, electrochemistry, vibrational Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations in the framework of DFT and TD\u2212DFT theories. Optical spectra are described in terms of one-electron promotions between orbitals around the energy gap. Electrochemistry, in the framework of the Koopman's approach, is also interpreted. The vibrational Raman spectra are assigned to molecular modes and the evolution changing the heteroatom is addressed and an effective tuning of these properties is found. Part of this modulation is associated with local electronic interactions depending on the relative S, Se, and Te electronegativities. Unconventional long-range heteroatom\u2212heteroatom interactions have been proposed which arise from the existence of effective \u03c0-conjugated channels. The molecular level understanding of structure\u2212property relationships in these organic/inorganic semiconductors are of great interest in the interdisciplinary area of material science.", "A Dibenzofuran-Based Host Material for Blue Electrophosphorescence_2006": "Dibenzofuran (DBF) is converted to a vacuum-sublimable, electron-transporting host material via 2,8-substitution with diphenylphosphine oxide moieties. Close \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking and the inductive influence of PO moieties impart favorable electron-transport properties without lowering the triplet energy. A maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.1% and luminance power efficiency of 25.9 lm/W are realized using this material as the host for the blue-green electrophosphorescent molecule, iridium(III) bis(4,6-(di-fluorophenyl)pyridinato-N,C2\u2018)picolinate (FIrpic).", "Functional Biocompatible Matrices from Mussel Byssus Waste_2017": "The mussel byssus is a biorenewable, protein-based material produced by marine mussels, which has attracted the interest of material scientists because of its remarkable mechanical and self-healing properties. Large quantities of byssus waste material from mussel mariculture are produced every year, which have great potential as a raw starting material for producing sustainable advanced materials. In this work, we developed a facile and scalable method to synthesize whole byssus-based porous matrices that retain part of the hierarchical organization of the pristine material at the nanoscale. The resulting material is biocompatible and maintains important native byssus features: metal ion chelation (\u226512 mg/g), collagen domains, and hierarchical organization, with tunable properties controlled via metal ion content. Furthermore, these biocompatible matrices showed a dye absorbing efficiency (up to 64 mg/g for anionic dyes) that was similar to or higher than that of the pristine byssus, a proof of preservation of structural motifs. These findings indicate that biorenewable matrices originating from byssus waste could have potential use in biomedical engineering and applied material science.", "Strong Metal-Support Interaction in Pt/TiO2 Induced by Mild HCHO and NaBH4 Solution Reduction and Its Effect on Catalytic Toluene Combustion_2014": "Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) in titania supported noble metals has been a subject of many studies due to its importance to many fields of science, in particular to material science and catalysis system. H2 reduction at a high temperature has been commonly considered as the inducement to SMSI in TiO2 supported noble metals. This work, however, demonstrates that SMSI in Pt/TiO2 can occur through mild NaBH4 and HCHO solution reduction processes based on CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations. Moreover, the effect of TiO2 crystalline forms on the degree of SMSI in NaBH4 reduced Pt/TiO2 and the performance of the as-reduced catalysts for trace toluene combustion reaction were studied. It was found that the degree of SMSI in Pt/TiO2 drew a significant effect on the catalytic performance.

The cyclobutane ring in CBDA-2 shows desired stabilities during thermal, sunlight, and chemical tests. The single crystal structure of CBDA-2 revealed the geometry of this molecule and orientation of the two dicarboxylic acid groups displaying its potential to serve as a unique, semirigid diacid building block in material science. A preliminary study showed that condensation of this diacid with glycerol yielded a green polymer with good stability. The diacid could also be used as a cross-linker for a biobased epoxy to yield an exceptionally hard and solvent-resistant thermoset.", "DNA Origami: Scaffolds for Creating Higher Order Structures_2017": "DNA has become one of the most extensively used molecular building blocks for engineering self-assembling materials. DNA origami is a technique that uses hundreds of short DNA oligonucleotides, called staple strands, to fold a long single-stranded DNA, which is called a scaffold strand, into various designer nanoscale architectures. DNA origami has dramatically improved the complexity and scalability of DNA nanostructures. Due to its high degree of customization and spatial addressability, DNA origami provides a versatile platform with which to engineer nanoscale structures and devices that can sense, compute, and actuate. These capabilities open up opportunities for a broad range of applications in chemistry, biology, physics, material science, and computer science that have often required programmed spatial control of molecules and atoms in three-dimensional (3D) space.

The widely studied carbon material now shares that distinction with boron nitride, according to researchers in Germany ( Nano Lett., DOI: 10.1021/nl9011497).\nScientists had long predicted that single-atom-thick sheets of materials like graphene would spontaneously roll up into tubes or other curved structures if, indeed, the superthin films could be formed at all.\nJust a few years ago, however, researchers showed that not only is it possible to separate atom-thick sheets of graphene from graphite, but it\u2019s also easy to do.

The development of robust, multidimensional, high-throughput, and large-scale characterization techniques of defects is thus crucial for the establishment of integrated nanophotonic technologies and material growth optimization. Here, we demonstrate the potential of wide-field spectral single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) for the determination of ensemble spectral properties as well as the characterization of spatial, spectral, and temporal dynamics of single defects in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown and irradiated exfoliated hexagonal boron-nitride materials. We characterize the heterogeneous spectral response of our samples and identify at least two types of defects in CVD-grown materials, while irradiated exfoliated flakes show predominantly only one type of defects. We analyze the blinking kinetics and spectral emission for each type of defects and discuss their implications with respect to the observed spectral heterogeneity of our samples. Our study shows the potential of wide-field spectral SMLM techniques in material science and paves the way toward the quantitative multidimensional mapping of defect properties.", "Recent Advances in Ultrathin Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials_2017": "Since the discovery of mechanically exfoliated graphene in 2004, research on ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials has grown exponentially in the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, and nanotechnology. Highlighting their compelling physical, chemical, electronic, and optical properties, as well as their various potential applications, in this Review, we summarize the state-of-art progress on the ultrathin 2D nanomaterials with a particular emphasis on their recent advances. First, we introduce the unique advances on ultrathin 2D nanomaterials, followed by the description of their composition and crystal structures. The assortments of their synthetic methods are then summarized, including insights on their advantages and limitations, alongside some recommendations on suitable characterization techniques. We also discuss in detail the utilization of these ultrathin 2D nanomaterials for wide ranges of potential applications among the electronics/optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, photocatalysis, and sensing platforms. Finally, the challenges and outlooks in this promising field are featured on the basis of its current development.", "Millimeter-Scale Growth of Single-Oriented Graphene on a Palladium Silicide Amorphous Film_2018": "It is widely accepted in condensed matter physics and material science communities that a single-oriented overlayer cannot be grown on an amorphous substrate because the disordered substrate randomizes the orientation of the seeds, leading to polycrystalline grains. In the case of two-dimensional materials such as graphene, the large-scale growth of single-oriented materials on an amorphous substrate has remained unsolved. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that the presence of uniformly oriented graphene seeds facilitates the growth of millimeter-scale single-oriented graphene with 3 \u00d7 4 mm2 on palladium silicide, which is an amorphous thin film, where the uniformly oriented graphene seeds were epitaxially grown. The amorphous palladium silicide film promotes the growth of the single-oriented growth of graphene by causing carbon atoms to be diffusive and mobile within and on the substrate. In contrast to these results, without the uniformly oriented seeds, the amorphous substrate leads to the growth of polycrystalline graphene grains. This millimeter-scale single-oriented growth from uniformly oriented seeds can be applied to other amorphous substrates.", "Regiospecific Synthesis of Au-Nanorod/SWCNT/Au-Nanorod Heterojunctions_2010": "The synthesis of precisely defined nanoscale hybrid materials remains a challenge at the frontier of chemistry and material science. In particular, the assembly of diverse high-aspect ratio one-dimensional materials such as gold nanorods and carbon nanotubes into functional systems is of ever increasing interest due to their electronic and sensing applications. To meet these challenges, methods for interfacing gold nanorods with carbon materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in a regio-controlled manner are needed. Herein, we report a method for the regiospecific synthesis of terminally linked gold nanorod-SWCNTs based on a nanotube surface protection strategy. The key to our approach is a SWCNT surface protection procedure allowing for selective functionalization of the SWCNT termini.", "Background Suppression in Near-Field Optical Imaging_2009": "In several recent studies, antenna-based optical microscopy has demonstrated its potential to resolve features as small as 10 nm. Most studies are concerned with well-separated features on flat surfaces, and there are only few studies that deal with samples of high feature density or even three-dimesional objects. The reason is that the external laser irradiation of the optical antenna (e.g., tip or particle) also directly irradiates the sample and therefore gives rise to a background. Here we introduce an efficient background suppression scheme that makes use of feedback modulation. The method is widely applicable and not restricted to cantilever-based scanning schemes. We apply this technique to both dense samples of dye molecules and ion channel proteins in plasma membranes and demonstrate effective background suppression and strongly improved sensitivity. The feedback modulation scheme is expected to find application for biological studies in liquid environments and for investigations of subsurface features in material science.", "Bioinspired Engineering of Sacrificial Metal\u2013Ligand Bonds into Elastomers with Supramechanical Performance and Adaptive Recovery_2016": "Reinforcing rubbers and expanding their application galleries are two important issues in material science and engineering. In this work, we demonstrate a bioinspired design of high-performance and macroscopically responsive diene-rubber by engineering sacrificial metal\u2013ligand motifs into a chemically cross-linked architecture network. The metal\u2013ligand bonds are formed through the coordination reaction between the pyridine groups in butadiene\u2013styrene\u2013vinylpyridine rubber (VPR) and metal ions. Under external load, the metal\u2013ligand bonds serve as sacrificial bonds that preferentially rupture prior to the covalent network, which dissipates energy and facilitates rubber chain orientation. Based on the function mechanisms, the modulus, tensile strength, and toughness of the samples are simultaneously improved without sacrificing the extensibility, and these properties can be conveniently tuned by varying the structure parameters of the covalently cross-linked network and metal\u2013ligand bonds. Moreover, the dissociation/re-formation of metal\u2013ligand bonds upon heating/cooling can endow VPR with thermally triggered adaptive recovery for shape memory application.", "A Material Matter_2013": "In January, Teijin announced that it had developed a carbon-nanotube fiber in collaboration with researchers at Rice University. The Japanese manufacturer of plastics, chemicals, and textiles is now showing samples of the fiber to potential customers. Despite the material\u2019s high price, Teijin is confident it will find demand. Teijin\u2019s confidence about the nanotube fiber stands in contrast with Bayer Material\u00adScience\u2019s decision last month to abandon its carbon-nanotube business. Nanotubes have potential, but the market is too fragmented and it will take too long to develop, the German firm said when announcing its exit.

Quantum chemical analysis on several therapeutically important guanylhydrazones indicated that all of them prefer the azine tautomeric state (by about 3\u201312 kcal/mol). A set of simple and conjugated azines were designed using quantum chemical methods, whose tautomeric preference toward the azine tautomer is in the range of 3\u20138 kcal/mol. Twenty new azines were synthesized and isolated in their neutral state. Variable temperature NMR study suggests existence of the azine tautomer even at higher temperatures with no traces of the hydrazone tautomer. The crystal structures of two representative compounds confirmed that the title compounds prefer to exist in their azine tautomeric form.", "The literature of forensic science_1985": "Summary of reference material applicable to forensic science.

Conjugation of synthetic polymers to proteins has the potential to improve the physical properties of the protein as well as provide functionality not typically found in native proteins, such as stimuli-responsive behavior and the programmable ability to self-assemble. This viewpoint discusses the design of protein\u2013polymer conjugates, an important class of block copolymers. Use of these hybrid molecules in biological and catalytic applications is highlighted, and the ability of the polymer to direct the solution and solid-state self-assembly of the hybrid block copolymers is reviewed. Future challenges in polymer and material science that will enable these hybrid molecules to reach their potential as protein-based materials are outlined.", "Biological Engineered Living Materials: Growing Functional Materials with Genetically Programmable Properties_2018": "Natural biological materials exhibit remarkable properties: self-assembly from simple raw materials, precise control of morphology, diverse physical and chemical properties, self-repair, and the ability to sense-and-respond to environmental stimuli. Despite having found numerous uses in human industry and society, the utility of natural biological materials is limited. But, could it be possible to genetically program microbes to create entirely new and useful biological materials? At the intersection between microbiology, material science, and synthetic biology, the emerging field of biological engineered living materials (ELMs) aims to answer this question. Here we review recent efforts to program cells to produce living materials with novel functional properties, focusing on microbial systems that can be engineered to grow materials and on new genetic circuits for pattern formation that could be used to produce the more complex systems of the future.", "Teaching To Avoid the \"CSI Effect\". Keeping the Science in Forensic Science_2006": "Because of the popularity of shows such as CSI and Cold Case there has been a documented increase in student interest in the sciences. This has been a boon to all of the sciences and brought new life into many programs. Along with the positive effects, however, there have also been some serious negative effects. One of these negatives, called the \"CSI effect\" by many, is that potential jurors have increased\u2014and sometimes wholly unrealistic\u2014expectations of science presented in the courtroom. Unfortunately, the way that forensic science is sometimes presented in the classroom can exacerbate the \"CSI effect\". In some cases, forensic science gets reduced to the equivalent of a standard laboratory exercise: follow these steps to perform this test, compare the results, match one of your results to \"the culprit\". The result is that students may also be getting an unrealistic set of expectations about how real forensic science is performed and a very skewed understanding of scientific methodology. Rather than simply catering to a current trend, this re-awakening of interest in science should be seen as an opportunity to advance understanding of the basic principles of science and critical thinking.", "FluidFM: Combining Atomic Force Microscopy and Nanofluidics in a Universal Liquid Delivery System for Single Cell Applications and Beyond_2009": "We describe the fluidFM, an atomic force microscope (AFM) based on hollow cantilevers for local liquid dispensing and stimulation of single living cells under physiological conditions. A nanofluidic channel in the cantilever allows soluble molecules to be dispensed through a submicrometer aperture in the AFM tip. The sensitive AFM force feedback allows controlled approach of the tip to a sample for extremely local modification of surfaces in liquid environments. It also allows reliable discrimination between gentle contact with a cell membrane or its perforation. Using these two procedures, dyes have been introduced into individual living cells and even selected subcellular structures of these cells. The universality and versatility of the fluidFM will stimulate original experiments at the submicrometer scale not only in biology but also in physics, chemistry, and material science.", "Smatterings of Science_1956": "The editors of Scientific American have collaborated with, their scientist authors to edit and arrange original magazine articles of the past seven years under five broad subjects.

The single-crystalline nature and ultrathin thickness of these 2D nanosheets make them ideal templates for the epitaxial deposition of nanostructures, which offer many possibilities to engineer microsized 2D p\u2013n hetero-junctions at atomic/nanometer scale. This Perspective aims to provide information on the epitaxial growth of hetero-nanostructures based on ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Various methods for the epitaxial growth of nanostructures based on ultrathin 2D nanosheets or in situ growth of lateral or vertical epitaxial 2D semiconductor hetero-nanostructures are introduced.

It makes more sense to use material that is in good condition. The first-time viewer will see your picture as a whole--imperfections and all--and will not mentally delete the imperfections, as you do.

A family of poly(isosorbide fatty alkylates) with different molecular architectures and physical aspects (viscous, sticky, rubbery, solid) is reported. We demonstrate that the adhesiveness of these materials can be mainly understood in terms of bulk viscoelasic factors, in contrast to alternative ideas reported in the literature. These results shed some light on the intimate structure of bioelastomers, and notably on the decisive role of a well-adjusted macroscopic cluster of percolated polyester chains for tailoring key biomaterial functions such as elasticity, stickiness, fibrillation, and biodegradation. By establishing a bridge between polyester biomaterials and the material science of sticky things, this Article provides robust design principles for diverse functional biomaterials with tailored dissipative characters such as adhesives with tunable stickiness and degradation profiles, or scaffolds mimicking the nonlinear elasticity of supersoft biological tissues.", "Nanofibrous Kevlar Aerogel Films and Their Phase-Change Composites for Highly Efficient Infrared Stealth_2019": "Infrared (IR) stealth is essential not only in high technology and modern military but also in fundamental material science. However, effectively hiding targets and rendering them invisible to thermal infrared detectors have been great challenges in past decades. Herein, flexible, foldable, and robust Kevlar nanofiber aerogel (KNA) films with high porosity and specific surface area were fabricated first. The KNA films display excellent thermal insulation performance and can be employed to incorporate with phase-change materials (PCMs), such as polyethylene glycol, to fabricate KNA/PCM composite films. The KNA/PCM films with high thermal management capability and infrared emissivity comparable to that of various backgrounds demonstrate high performance in IR stealth in outdoor environments with solar illumination variations. To further realize hiding hot targets from IR detection, combined structures constituted of thermal insulation layers (KNA films) and ultralow IR transmittance layers (KNA/PCM) are proposed. A hot target covered with this combined structure becomes completely invisible in infrared images. Such KNA/PCM films and KNA\u2013KNA/PCM combined structures hold great promise for broad applications in infrared thermal stealth.", "NEW MATERIAL FOR DATA STORAGE_2008": "A FAMILY OF COMPOUNDS endowed with a property that enables them to be switched between two magnetic states may form the basis of future high-density data-storage technologies, according to researchers in Italy and Germany.

This chemoselective redox-responsive ligation (CRRL) and release strategy is based on a redox switchable oxime linkage that is controlled by mild chemical or electrochemical redox signals and can be performed at physiological conditions without the use of a catalyst. Both conjugation and release reactions are kinetically well behaved and quantitative. The CRRL strategy is synthetically modular and easily monitored and characterized by routine analytical techniques. We demonstrate how the CRRL strategy can be used for the dynamic generation of cyclic peptides and the ligation of two different peptides that are stable but can be selectively cleaved upon changes in the redox environment. We also demonstrate a new redox based delivery of cargoes to live cells strategy via the CRRL methodology by synthesizing a FRET redox-responsive probe that is selectively activated within a cellular environment. We believe the ease of the CRRL strategy should find wide use in a range of applications in biology, tissue engineering, nanoscience, synthetic chemistry, and material science and will expand the suite of current conjugation and release strategies.", "Facile Synthesis of TMS-Protected Trifluoromethylated Alcohols Using Trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane (TMSCF3) and Various Nucleophilic Catalysts in DMF_2006": "Organofluorine compounds are becoming increasingly important in different fields, such as material science, agro chemistry, and the pharmaceutical industry. Nucleophilic trifluoromethylation is one of the widely used methods to incorporate a trifluoromethyl moiety into organic molecules. We have carried out extensive studies to develop varieties of easily accessible nucleophilic catalysts to promote such reactions. TMS-protected trifluoromethylated alcohols were prepared from both aldehydes and ketones in excellent yields using catalytic amount of amine N-oxide. Carbonate and phosphate salts also showed efficient catalytic activity toward this reaction. These reactions were highly solvent dependent, and DMF was found to be the most suitable one among the various solvents studied. All these reactions proceeded under very mild conditions, giving clean products and avoiding the use of any fluoride initiators or expensive catalysts, and extremely water-free conditions. The mechanism for the reaction is discussed in detail.

One challenge has been how to get those images to move. Now, researchers have created a material that can display different two-dimensional holographic images as the material is stretched (Nano Lett. 2017, DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00807). The technology takes a step toward animated holography, the researchers say. Typical holograms are made from materials such as photopolymers that form cross-links when exposed to light. Once the cross-links are made in the materials, the resulting hologram image is fixed, says Ritesh Agarwal, a materials scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Agarwal and his colleagues created their stretchy hologram out of a so-called metasurface: a thin film that contains nanostructures designed to shape and reflect light. Their metasurface consisted of a square of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) embedded with precisely placed gold nanorods.

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a vibrational spectroscopy technique that can attain single-molecule sensitivity and has been shown to complement mass spectrometry, but lacks widespread application without a robust method that utilizes the effect. We demonstrate a new, highly sensitive, and widely applicable approach to SERS analysis based on laser ablation in the presence of a tailored plasmonic substrate. We analyze several challenging compounds, including non-water-soluble pigments and dyed leather from an ancient Egyptian chariot, achieving sensitivity as high as 120 amol for a 1:1 signal-to-noise ratio and 5 \u03bcm spatial resolution.

Photoluminescence of Te bulk solid crystal was observed at 3.75 \u03bcm in the midwavelength infrared (MWIR) region, matching the theoretically predicted value well. With increasing the photoexcitation intensity or decreasing temperature, we successfully observed MWIR random lasing of the bulk Te crystals at 3.62 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the rod-shaped Te microcrystals efficiently exhibit second harmonic and third harmonic lasing at MWIR and short-wavelength infrared regions, respectively. Nonlinear coherent MWIR lasing from the Te microcrystals will serve as an excellent mid-IR light source, opening up new applications in infrared photonics, extremely long-depth penetration bioimaging, and optoelectronics.", "SCIENCE INSIGHTS_1995": "Why is chemistry the forgotten science?\nDespite the fact that chemistry is the central science, the science that has had more of an impact on humanity than all other sciences combined, it has never produced a chronicler of the likes of Lewis Thomas, or Stephen Jay Gould, or Carl Sagan, or Stephen Hawking.

This method has been successfully applied in many different fields, ranging from chemistry to biophysics and ligand docking and from material science to crystal structure prediction. We present an important development that speeds up metadynamics calculations by orders of magnitude and renders the algorithm much more robust. We use multiple interacting simulations, walkers, for exploring and reconstructing the same free energy surface. Each walker contributes to the history-dependent potential that, in metadynamics, is an estimate of the free energy. We show that the error on the reconstructed free energy does not depend on the number of walkers, leading to a fully linear scaling algorithm even on inexpensive loosely coupled clusters of PCs. In addition, we show that the accuracy and stability of the method are much improved by combining it with a weighted histogram analysis. We check the validity of our new method on a realistic application.", "SCIENCE_1952": "An important challenge of modern material science is the depth-sensitive and nondestructive analysis of the chemical binding state of complex structures consisting of multiple thin layers. In general, the correlation of the material functionality and underlying chemical and physical properties is the key question in view of directed device development, performance, and quality control. It has been shown that the combined method grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence analysis (GIXRF) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) can significantly contribute to the nondestructive chemical analysis of buried thin films and interface structures regarding chemical speciation. Recently, we have enhanced the method to allow for a depth-resolved analysis of multilayered nanoscaled thin film structures. By means of appropriate model systems, the methodology has been developed and successfully validated.

This method combines vapor phase and solution based multilayers assembly techniques in a unified concept. The MLE approach was proved fruitful by applying Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) techniques. The resulting MLE-derived low-dimensional multilayered structures exhibited high structural regularity and thermal stability. The above vapor phase assembly technique led to the formation of organic multiple quantum wells (OMQW) structures, where the solid-state electronic properties are governed by finite size effects. The various emitting species in the solid state were studied by modeling intermolecular interactions in solution. The strong tendency for \u03c0-aggregation in model compounds is evident in their crystal structure as well. This driving force for in-plane stacking also enhances the mobilities of electrons with-in this layer leading to unique electroluminescent properties.

Mater. 2018, DOI: 10.1038/s41563-018-0168-4). The findings could help explain why the material breaks down over time. Compared with lithium-cobalt materials used as cathodes in batteries for electric vehicles and portable electronics, lithium iron phosphate is cheaper and safer and lasts twice as long, for around 1,000 charge cycles. This lifetime could be even longer, potentially tens of thousands of charging cycles, says William Chueh, a materials scientist and engineer at Stanford University. But during battery discharge, when lithium ions move from the electrolyte into a lithium iron phosphate cathode, the ions tend to collect in hot spots in the material, creating lithium-rich and lithium-poor regions. This causes the material to break apart over time. Chueh and colleagues, including chemical engineer Martin Z.

In this contribution, we report a conceptually simple and versatile strategy for the formation of reconfigurable nanoparticle arrangements. The key role in our approach is played by star block copolymers from controlled radical RAFT polymerization, which fulfill the dual task of guiding the particle arrangement and also of equipping the nanomaterials with stimulus-responsiveness. By virtue of their block structure, the star polymers provide at the same time colloidal stability and responsive properties. Structural switching in response to the applied stimulus was investigated by means of small-angle X-ray scattering and dynamic light scattering. The developed approach is general, easy to implement, and may provide new prospects for the development of colloidal actuators, nanoscale materials with switchable properties, and nanoscale machines.", "Science's Demons_1996": "The scientific enterprise faces two major difficulties. One is the relatively new problem that everything important may have already been discovered.

Through the use of dedicated nanofluidic devices and by taking advantage of an original physical effect called capillary focusing, we could circumvent some of these limitations. The nanofluidic (i.e., submicrometric) devices introduced herein are made of soft materials, and their fabrication relies upon rapid technologies. The objects that we have generated are simple droplets, multiple droplets, particles, and Janus particles whose sizes lie between 900 nm and 3 \u03bcm (i.e., within the colloidal range).

In this review, we seek to describe the chemical forms and functionalities of the main types of conductive polymers, as well as their synthesis methods. We also present an in-depth analysis of composite conductive polymers that contain various nanomaterials such as graphene, fullerene, carbon nanotubes, and paramagnetic metal ions. Natural polymers such as collagen, chitosan, fibroin, and hydrogel that are structurally modified for them to be conductive are also briefly touched upon. Finally, we expound on the plethora of biomedical applications that harbor the potential to be revolutionized by conductive polymers, with a particular focus on tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biosensors.", "Sticky gecko-inspired material conducts electricity                      _2016": "A new take on adhesives inspired by sticky gecko feet has led to stretchy silicone patches that conduct electricity and cling fast to skin, even underwater (ACS Nano 2016, DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.6b01355).

This proliferation of interest is a reflection of the growing awareness that by achieving predictable and reproducible release rates of bioactive agents, particularly pharmaceuticals, to the target environment for a desired duration, optimum biological responses, prolonged efficacy, decreased toxicity as well as reduction of required dose level as compared to the conventional mode of delivery can be effectively achieved.\nSo far, the controlled-release pharmaceutical area has gained the most significant growth as a result of intense interdisciplinary efforts involving contributions from chemistry, material science, engineering, pharmacology and other related biological sciences.

From 1934 a newly formed organization within the Hays Office, the Production Code Administration, oversaw enforcement of the Hays Code. In this chapter I explore how these censorship organizations applied their interpretation of the Hays Code to issues involving movie science in the early years of its administration in the 1930s and early-1940s. I examine the censorship files of three science-heavy movies from these years, Warner Brothers\u2019 Dr. Ehrlich\u2019s Magic Bullet, Paramount Studios\u2019 Island of Lost Souls and Universal Pictures\u2019 Captive Wild Woman. These films serve as case studies showing how film censors\u2019 concerns about scientific research often dovetailed with their primary concerns over sex and violence in movies.

Employers are increasingly recognizing international experience as added value in job candidates, and many now believe that studying abroad is essential to the education experience. Recognizing the impact a this experience can have on a student\u2019s life, the American Chemical Society has developed relevant programs and activities that promote international experience and global mobility. Two programs are highlighted in this work: International Research Experience for Undergraduates programs (IREU) and ACS International Center\u2122. The ACS International Center (www.acs.org/ic) features listings on more than 350 scientific collaboration and research opportunities from over 100 different funding organizations in 15 different regions worldwide, surpassing any other such database of opportunities in chemistry. Anyone interested can easily search for these opportunities on the International Center website. The ACS IREU program provides talented chemistry and material science students with a cross-cultural experience at the best research laboratories abroad. Reciprocally, it gives international students the opportunity to study at domestic REU sites at U.S. universities. Both programs facilitate global networking and catalyzes international collaborations.", "Effect of Ag+ on the Excited-State Properties of a Gas-Phase (Cytosine)2Ag+ Complex: Electronic Transition and Estimated Lifetime_2014": "Recently, DNA molecules have received great attention because of their potential applications in material science. One interesting example is the production of highly fluorescent and tunable DNA\u2013Agn clusters with cytosine (C)-rich DNA strands. Here, we report the UV photofragmentation spectra of gas-phase cytosine\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ag+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7cytosine (C2Ag+) and cytosine\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7cytosine (C2H+) complexes together with theoretical calculations. In both cases, the excitation energy does not differ significantly from that of isolated cytosine or protonated cytosine, indicating that the excitation takes place on the DNA base. However, the excited-state lifetime of the C2H+ (\u03c4 = 85 fs), estimated from the bandwidth of the spectrum, is at least 2 orders of magnitude shorter than that of the C2Ag+ (\u03c4 > 5000 fs). The increased excited-state lifetime upon silver complexation is quite unexpected, and it clearly opens the question about what factors are controlling the nonradiative decay in pyrimidine DNA bases. This is an important result for the expanding field of metal-mediated base pairing and may also be important to the photophysical properties of DNA-templated fluorescent silver clusters.", "Micro/Nanoscale Patterning of Nanostructured Metal Substrates for Plasmonic Applications_2009": "The ability to precisely control the pattern of different metals at the micro- and nanoscale, along with their topology, has been demonstrated to be essential for many applications, ranging from material science to biomedical devices, electronics, and photonics. In this work, we show a novel approach, based on a combination of lithographic techniques and galvanic displacement reactions, to fabricate micro- and nanoscale patterns of different metals, with highly controlled surface roughness, onto a number of suitable substrates. We demonstrate the possibility to exploit such metal films to achieve significant fluorescence enhancement of nearby fluorophores, while maintaining accurate spatial control of the process, from submicron resolution to centimeter-sized features. These patterns may be also exploited for a wide range of applications, including SERS, solar cells, DNA microarray technology, hydrophobic/hydrophilic substrates, and magnetic devices.", "Precise Self-Assembly and Controlled Catalysis of Thermoresponsive Core\u2013Satellite Multicomponent Hybrid Nanoparticles_2018": "The construction of multicomponent hybrid nanomaterials with well-controlled architecture, especially bearing an ordered homogeneity and distribution of the subunits with tunable functions, is a key challenge in chemistry and material science. Herein, we reported a versatile and novel strategy to fabricate core\u2013satellite multicomponent nanostructures with tunable interparticle distances and catalysis properties by the combination of surface-initiated reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer (SI-RAFT) polymerization and self-assembly. The arrangement and interparticle distance of gold satellites could be precisely tuned by the SI-RAFT polymerization process and the feeding ratio of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and the core nanoparticle. It is worth to note that multilayered core\u2013satellite nanostructures have been fabricated by a high-feeding ratio of AuNPs and magnetite NP (MNP)@SiO2\u2013PNIPAm. Notably, the core\u2013satellite MNP@SiO2\u2013PNIPAm\u2013Au nanoparticles exhibited excellent thermoresponsive behaviors with the change of temperature. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of MNP@SiO2\u2013PNIPAm\u2013Au nanoparticles via the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol can be well modulated by the nanoparticle size, temperature, and polymer feed ratio. This strategy for precise construction of core\u2013satellite nanostructures would open a new pathway to construct multicomponent functional nanostructures.", "Creating Machine Learning-Driven Material Recipes Based on Crystal Structure_2019": "Determining the manner in which crystal structures are formed is considered a great mystery within materials science. Potential solutions have the possibility to be uncovered by revealing hidden patterns within the material data. Data science is therefore implemented in order to link the material data to the crystal structure. In particular, unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques are used where the Gaussian mixture model is employed in order to understand the data structure of the materials database while random forest classification is used to predict the crystal structure. As a result, the unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques reveal descriptors for determining the crystal structure via the materials database. In addition, predicting atomic combinations from the crystal structure is also achieved using a trained machine where the first-principles calculations confirm the stability of predicted materials. Thus, one can consider that the estimation of the crystal structure can be achieved in principle via the combination of material data and machine learning, thereby leading to the advancement of crystal structure prediction.", "Directed Synthesis of Stable Large Polyoxomolybdate Spheres_2008": "Polyoxometalates or POMs, a class of inorganic transition metal-oxide based clusters, have gained significant interest owing to their catalytic, magnetic, and material science applications. All such applications require high surface area POM based materials. However, chemically synthesized POMs are still at most in the range of a few nanometers, with their size and morphology being difficult to control. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop design principles that allow easy control of POM morphology and size on mesoscopic (50\u2212500 nm) length scales. Here, we report a design strategy to meet this need. Our method reported here avoids a complex chemical labyrinth by using a prefabricated cationic 1,2-dioleol-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) vesicle as a scaffold/structure directing agent and gluing simple anionic heptamolybdates by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds to form large POM spheres. By this method, complexity in the resulting structure can be deliberately induced either via the scaffold or via the oxometalate. The high degree of control in the matter of the size and morphology of the resulting POM superstructures renders this method attractive from a synthetic standpoint.", "An Ultimate Stereocontrol in Asymmetric Synthesis of Optically Pure Fully Aromatic Helicenes_2015": "The role of the helicity of small molecules in enantioselective catalysis, molecular recognition, self-assembly, material science, biology, and nanoscience is much less understood than that of point-, axial-, or planar-chiral molecules. To uncover the envisaged potential of helically chiral polyaromatics represented by iconic helicenes, their availability in an optically pure form through asymmetric synthesis is urgently needed. We provide a solution to this problem present since the birth of helicene chemistry in 1956 by developing a general synthetic methodology for the preparation of uniformly enantiopure fully aromatic [5]-, [6]-, and [7]helicenes and their functionalized derivatives. [2 + 2 + 2] Cycloisomerization of chiral triynes combined with asymmetric transformation of the first kind (ultimately controlled by the 1,3-allylic-type strain) is central to this endeavor.

The real spread and success of this expectation will be strictly linked to different factors, among which a fundamental one will be the capacity of simulations of (supra)molecular systems to include environment effects. It is in fact well-known that molecular responses and processes are strongly affected or, in some cases, completely determined by the surrounding environment (either a solvent, a protein, a membrane, a polymer, or a composite matrix).

They borrow in the sense that the laws that serve as the basis of chemistry, physics, and engineering are equally applicable to macromolecules. They contribute in a similar manner, that is, basic principles formulated within the framework of polymer science and technology are applicable to chemistry and other disciplines. Thus, the technological principles applicable to the processing of metals are applicable to the processing of polymers and vice versa.\nBriefly, polymer science is the science that deals with large molecules wherein the chemical bonds are largely covalent. Polymer technology is the practical application of polymer science. The word \"polymer\" is derived from the Greek \"poly\" (many) and \"meros\" (parts).

The model is used to calculate average sizes of homopolymers and copolymers in solution when the segments either have or do not have orientational biases. We also employ it to treat molecules that have many local intrachain attractions and calculate their average sizes as functions of the interaction strength. In spite of these capabilities, the random-climb model is rarely, if ever, presented in the polymer educational literature. This article attempts to remedy that situation by drawing attention to the model's inherent advantages and serving as an introduction to polymer physical properties for students studying chemistry, chemical engineering, material science and related fields.", "Fast Photochromism Involving Thermally-Activated Valence Isomerization of Phenoxyl-Imidazolyl Radical Complex Derivatives_2016": "Open-shell biradicals have received considerable attention in material science because of their high two-photon absorption cross sections and broad and high absorptive features over the visible region. However, the instability of the biradical caused by the open-shell nature was one of the drawbacks; therefore, novel radical compounds which can suppress unwanted reactions by tuning the open-shell features are desired to expand the versatility of the radical compounds. Here, we report a novel radical-dissociation-type photochromic compound whose photochromic reaction involves a valence isomerization from the open-shell biradical to closed-shell quinoidal forms by using a phenoxyl-imidazolyl radical complex framework. The valence isomerization from the biradical to quinoid forms effectively tunes the open-shell feature in time and drastically changes the spectral features, which were revealed by time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This novel fast photochromic property not only is important for fundamental spin chemistry but also expands the versatility of the radical compounds for novel advanced photofunctional materials.", "A GUIDE TO DIGITAL LITERATURE_2002": "SOMETIMES, IN THE MIDST OF radical change, it pays to pause and take stock of the current situation.

The same series of functionalized AuNRs were studied in the isotropic concentrated dispersions by high-resolution NMR diffusometry. The dependence of translational and rotational diffusivity upon molecular weight and polymer end group were measured as a function of temperature in the region of the brush phase transition. The effective hydrodynamic radius of AuNR composites proved to be the most sensitive quantity to the temperature-induced phase transition of brushes, allowing the evaluation of the brush thickness in the swollen and collapsed states.", "An Efficient Linear-Scaling Electrostatic Coupling for Treating Periodic Boundary Conditions in QM/MM Simulations_2006": "A new linear-scaling method based on a multigrid approach to treat long-range electrostatic interactions in hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations is described. The scheme has been implemented in the context of a QM calculation based on density functional theory (DFT). The method is tested on an analytical model to validate the new algorithm. Two realistic problems in \u03b1-quartz crystals and a zwitterionic dipeptide (GLY-ALA) in water have been chosen as further tests. Results from QM/MM calculations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) show that the use of PBC is essential when studying highly ordered crystal structures, unless a carefully designed MM crystal is used for the calculation. With a general shaped MM subsystem, the absence of PBC leads to an incorrect description of Kohn\u2212Sham band gaps and charge density. The present method allows periodic boundary conditions to be used in molecular simulations of biological and material science systems.", "Columnar Liquid Crystals Self-Assembled by Minimalistic Peptides for Chiral Sensing and Synthesis of Ordered Mesoporous Silica_2018": "We report the spontaneous formation of lyotropic liquid crystals from the self-assembly of a series of minimalistic peptides. The highly charged peptides could self-assemble into rigid helical nanofilaments in water and spontaneously order into hexagonal liquid-crystalline phases with interfilament separations of \u2264240 \u00c5. The formation of liquid crystals from the self-assembly of such simple peptides is dictated not only by the concentration and pH but also by the amino acid sequence of the peptides. Peptides containing the rigid Phe-Phe (FF) segment showed much higher propensities to form a liquid-crystalline phase with long-range order. Moreover, because of the intrinsic chirality of the peptides, the self-assembled birefringent liquid crystals could serve as sensing elements for the visual discrimination of chiral species and as templates for the biomimetic synthesis of mesoporous silica with ordered cavities.

Here, a rapid in situ control of pinning and actuation of organic droplets is demonstrated on dodecylbenzenesulfonate-doped polypyrrole (PPy(DBS)) surfaces in an aqueous environment via an electrochemical redox process. A dramatic change of the pinning results from the transport of DBS\u2013 molecules between the PPy(DBS) surface and the aqueous environment, as well as from a simultaneous alternation of the surface oleophobicity to organic liquids during the redox process. This in situ control of the droplet pinning enables a stop-and-go droplet actuation, applicable to both polar and apolar organic droplets, at low voltages (\u223c0.9 V) with an extremely low roll-off angle (\u223c0.4\u00b0).", "Chemistry, The Central Science?

Nguyen joined the inaugural cohort of the University of Western Ontario\u2019s integrated science program, one of a handful at universities in Canada and the UK that are treating the sciences as a whole rather than a bunch of siloed parts. \u201cThe integrated science program attracted me because I was able to be exposed to all the sciences and basically choose the ones I liked the most,\u201d says Nguyen, who eventually picked chemistry and will graduate next spring.

The synthesis was carried out at high pressure\u2013high temperature (HPHT) and subsequently quenched to ambient condition. The formation and reproducibility have been confirmed in the pressure range of 4.7 to 9.2 GPa. Employing contribution of different probes viz.X-ray diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and ab initio electronic structure calculation, the structure of MnC was found to be ZnS type i.e. a cubic lattice with a = 4.4294(2) \u00c5. The bulk modulus has been determined to be 170(5) GPa from in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HPXRD). Hardness of ZnS type MnC is estimated from an empirical relation to be about 40 GPa, making it a potential superhard material.", "Preparation of Magnetic Hybrid Copolymer\u2013Cobalt Hierarchical Hollow Spheres by Localized Ostwald Ripening_2007": "We report a one-step solvothermal method to prepare magnetic hybrid copolymer\u2013Co hierarchical hollow spheres by localized Ostwald ripening. The initial stage is the aggregation of primary inorganic nanoparticles whose surfaces are partially adsorbed by copolymer PEG\u2013PPG\u2013PEG to form solid spheres followed by hollowing of the core and the progressive matter redistribution from the interior to the exterior. Meanwhile, amorphous inorganic particles grow to cubic crystallites. Finally, a hollow spherical architecture with an extensively roughened surface is obtained by this self-transformation. The effect of NaOH concentration (served as a catalyst and reagent) on the sphere morphology is also checked by time-dependent experiments. When decreasing the mass of NaOH from 7.5 to 2.5 mmol, a morphology transformation from porous hollow spheres to double-wall spheres and then to single-wall spheres with platelet-like building units aligned disorderly on the outer surfaces is observed, and this morphology transformation is related to Ostwald ripening. Our results suggest that these nanoparticle-based hollow hierarchical spheres collected by the self-transformation of precursor objects could be of potential applicability in the fields of material science and biomedical technology.", "Long-Range Surface Plasmons on Ultrathin Membranes_2007": "A waveguide structure supporting long-range surface plasmon waves in any gaseous or liquid environment is described. The waveguide comprises a large area dielectric membrane of nanometric thickness upon which thin metal stripes and features are deposited. This structure allows the environment to surround the stripe thus ensuring that an essentially symmetric dielectric background is always present, as required to support the wave. The membrane perturbs the wave in a manner that significantly increases its surface sensitivity. The high surface sensitivity in concert with the ability to create long optical interaction length plasmonic structures leads to high sensitivity (bio)chemical sensors. Theoretical results describing the operation of the structure are given along with experimental results demonstrating the propagation of long-range surface plasmons in air and in liquid. The structure opens up a wealth of opportunities for research and application across many fields, including plasmonics, photonics, material science, surfaces, and solid\u2212liquid interfaces.", "Chemical phenomena in elementary school science_1966": "Describes how the Science Curriculum Improvement Study is approaching the incorporation of chemical phenomena into an elementary school science program.", "DNA\u2212Cyclodextrin Composite Material for Environmental Applications_2008": "Recently, we prepared water-insoluble and nuclease-resistant DNA films by UV irradiation. The DNA films accumulated the harmful DNA-intercalating compounds, such as ethidium bromide and acridine orange. Additionally, the water-insoluble DNA films bound endocrine disruptors that had planar structures, such as dioxin derivatives, polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) derivatives, and benzo[a]pyrene. However, other harmful endocrine disruptors that lack a planar structure, such as bisphenol A and diethylstilbestrol, did not bind the water-insoluble DNA films. Therefore, we prepared the DNA\u2212cyclodextrin composite material by mixing the DNA and the cyclodextrin-immobilized poly(allylamine) (PCD). As a result, these composite materials had properties of both the double-stranded DNA, such as intercalation, and the cyclodextrin, such as encapsulation of an organic molecule into the intramolecular cavity. Therefore, these materials could accumulate not only the harmful compounds with planar structures but also the nonplanar molecules, such as bisphenol A, diethylstilbestrol, and nonylphenol. These DNA\u2212PCD composite materials may have the potential to be novel environmental materials that absorb harmful compounds.", "The Next Frontier: Quantitative Biochemistry in Living Cells_2017": "Researchers striving to convert biology into an exact science foremost rely on structural biology and biochemical reconstitution approaches to obtain quantitative data. However, cell biological research is moving at an ever-accelerating speed into areas where these approaches lose much of their edge. Intrinsically unstructured proteins and biochemical interaction networks composed of interchangeable, multivalent, and unspecific interactions pose unique challenges to quantitative biology, as do processes that occur in discrete cellular microenvironments. Here we argue that a conceptual change in our way of conducting biochemical experiments is required to take on these new challenges. We propose that reconstitution of cellular processes in vitro should be much more focused on mimicking the cellular environment in vivo, an approach that requires detailed knowledge of the material properties of cellular compartments, essentially requiring a material science of the cell. In a similar vein, we suggest that quantitative biochemical experiments in vitro should be accompanied by corresponding experiments in vivo, as many newly relevant cellular processes are highly context-dependent. In essence, this constitutes a call for chemical biologists to convert their discipline from a proof-of-principle science to an area that could rightfully be called quantitative biochemistry in living cells.

Here, we present a catalytic selective oxidative coupling of secondary N-alkylaniline to afford azoxyarene with tungsten catalyst under mild conditions. In addition, azoxy can be viewed as a bioisostere of alkene and amide. Several \u201cazoxyarene analogues\u201d of the corresponding bioactive alkenes and amides showed comparable promising anticancer activities.", "A Thermodynamically Stable Nanophase Material_2006": "Nanoparticles are metastable relative to the equivalent bulk material due to the positive excess interfacial free energy (IFE). Previous studies have shown that, with increasing surface interaction strength, the IFE diminishes but remains positive. We describe an experimental multicomponent system in which a nanoscale ZnS material is thermodynamically favored and can be formed at the expense of bulk ZnS. In 17 M sodium hydroxide solution, at 230 \u00b0C, both 3 nm ZnS nanoparticles and bulk ZnS are transformed into sheetlike nanocrystals with a ZnS polytype structure. Our results are theoretically compatible with the concept of a negative IFE, although not with the assumption of constant interface composition. We clarify the meaning of an effective negative IFE and present the necessary conditions for strong chemical surface interactions to stabilize nanoscale inorganic materials relative to bulk matter.

On the basis of this physical phenomenon we propose a new microscopy technique that enables the prediction of spatial features of chirality of nanoscale samples by exploiting the photoinduced optical force exerted on an achiral tip in the vicinity of the test specimen. The tip\u2013sample interactive system is illuminated by structured light to probe both the transverse and longitudinal (with respect to the beam propagation direction) components of the sample\u2019s magnetoelectric polarizability as the manifestation of its sense of handedness, i.e., chirality. We specifically prove that although circularly polarized waves are adequate to detect the transverse polarizability components of the sample, they are unable to probe the longitudinal component. To overcome this inadequacy and probe the longitudinal chirality, we propose a judiciously engineered combination of radially and azimuthally polarized beams as optical vortices possessing pure longitudinal electric and magnetic field components along their vortex axis, respectively. The proposed technique may benefit branches of science such as stereochemistry, biomedicine, physical and material science, and pharmaceutics.", "Deconstructing Science To Find Its Values_1999": "\"Mystery of Mysteries: Is Evolution a Social Construction?\" by Michael Ruse, Harvard University Press, 1999, 296 pages, $27.50 (ISBN 0-674-46706-X)\nThe title of Michael Ruse's book\u2014\"Mystery of Mysteries: Is Evolution a Social Construction?\"\u2014suggests a rather ambitious undertaking, and on that score readers are certainly not disappointed.

The requirement of ultraviolet light for azobenzene isomerization is not ideal for biological systems due to poor tissue penetration and potentially damaging effects. While modified azobenzene cores with a red-shifted cis-to-trans isomerization have been previously described, they have not yet been incorporated into a powerful method to control protein function: the photoswitchable tethered ligand (PTL) approach. We report the synthesis and characterization of a red-shifted PTL, L-MAG0460, for the light-gated ionotropic glutamate receptor LiGluR. In cultured mammalian cells, the LiGluR+L-MAG0460 system is activated rapidly by illumination with 400\u2013520 nm light to generate a large ionic current. The current rapidly turns off in the dark as the PTL relaxes thermally back to the trans configuration.

In the present work, three different strategies have been exploited for the successful fabrication of hybrid dots-on-wire metallic nanostructures through combining an in-situ method with an ex-situ method. Basically, plasma etching was applied to generate a metallic wire-like nanostructure, and preformed nanoparticles could be placed through multiple means before or after the formation of the wire-like nanostructure. Various monometallic and bimetallic nanostructures have been obtained by utilizing only one functional domain of block copolymer templates. In these cases, full utilization of the functional domain or introduction of the molecular linker is critical to engineering hybrid metallic nanostructures. Other complex and multifunctional hybrid nanostructures can be developed via these strategies similarly, and these nanostructures are promising for useful applications such as optics and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).", "SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY CONCENTRATES_1996": "\u25aa Nanocomposites may make digital X-ray imaging a reality\nTwo DuPont chemists have described what they believe is a totally new approach for making X-ray-sensitive photoconductors [ Science , 273 , 632 (1996)].

Interdisciplinary areas of chemistry such as environmental chemistry, polymer science, and material science have become important parts of the undergraduate curriculum. However, introduction of these multidisciplinary areas into classical chemistry curricula often requires acquisition of specialized analytical equipment. At the same time, more traditional characterization techniques such as polarimetry have been replaced by the routine use of FT-IR and GC-MS techniques in undergraduate organic chemistry laboratories. While such classical instruments remain serviceable, they have in many cases fallen into disuse. Here we describe a simple method whereby a polarimeter is converted into a contact angle goniometer.\nContact angle goniometry is an example of a traditional analytical tool that would be an asset to any physical chemistry training and that would still be of relevance to many interdisciplinary areas. Such instrumentation provides a simple and inexpensive way to introduce and measure fundamental properties such as the surface tension of a variety of materials including metals and polymers. Contact angle measurements are indispensable in the study of adhesion, wettability, and liquid thermodynamics (1 - 3). Many experiments using such measurements can be devised for traditional physical chemistry laboratory sequences. The concept of surface energy is important in materials science, chemistry, and physics. Thus it could not only enhance students' learning but also provide them with new perspective on the fascinating field of surface chemistry and physics.", "Investigating the Photochemistry of Spiropyran Metal Complexes with Online LED-NMR_2019": "As one of the best studied photoswitches, spiropyrans (SPs) have attracted significant interest in the scientific community. Among the many stimuli to alter the isomerization into the merocyanine (MC) isomer, such as temperature, pH, solvent polarity, redox potential, or mechanical force, the ability of the MC form to act as a ligand site for metal complexation has recently raised new attention.

However, low processability, few opportunities for polymer functionalization, and explosive monomers hampering academic investigation of these materials have precluded the extension of the unique properties of perfluorocarbons to the cutting edge of material science. Here, we present semifluorinated iodo\u2013ene polymers as a scaffold to overcome fluoropolymer limitations. A sodium dithionate initiated polymerization of perfluorodiiodides and dienes allows for high-molecular-weight polymers (>100 kDa) to be prepared in the presence of oxygen and water with up to 59 wt % fluorine content. These conditions are sufficiently mild to enable the polymerization of functional dienes, leading to biodegradable fluoropolymers. The iodo\u2013ene polymerization results in the addition of polarizable iodine atoms, which improve polymer processability; yet, these atoms can be removed after processing for enhanced stability. Displacement of the iodine atoms with thiols or azides facilitates covalent surface modification and cross-linking. Finally, the low bond dissociation energy of the C\u2013I bond allows allyl group addition as well as photo-cross-linking.

Therefore, strong light\u2013matter interaction is induced by the near-field enhancement effects of LSPRs. Because the resonant wavelength of LSPRs can be easily controlled by the size and shape of the metallic nanoparticles in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range, LSPRs have received considerable attention as optical antennae for light energy conversion systems such as solar cells. LSPRs decay very quickly as a result of light scattering and excitation of electron\u2013hole pairs in the metal itself. However, in addition to the near-field enhancement effect, this light scattering and electron\u2013hole pair excitation, which are known to cause loss of LSPRs, can be utilized as a solar cell enhancement mechanism.

Techniques such as inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis are used to investigate the porous nature of xerogels. Conclusions are drawn on the basis of measurements that reflect the pore diameters. By varying the synthetic processes and comparing their experimental results, students are introduced to the concept of cooperative learning to enhance teamwork in the laboratory.

Such reactions open new opportunities for producing the poorly studied endohedral covalent derivatives of C60, which may be of great interest for fullerene chemistry and material science. In the present work, we have performed accurate theoretical study on the compression of the recently synthesized H2O@C60 endofullerene. Calculations show that inner-cavity chemical reaction C60 + H2O can take place if H2O@C60 is compressed in the direction of two opposite pentagons. In the case of hexagon-to-hexagon compression, there is no chemical reaction, and relaxation of the compressed structure leads to the original H2O@C60.

On the other hand, photochemical reaction to switch a molecule from one isomer to the other with different geometry and property in a high yield will continue to play a vital role in the synthetic chemistry and material science. Because of the important role of efficient photoisomerization, a biomimetic approach for \u201cseeing\u201d and controlling the photoisomerization is developed by using the technology of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) with supramolecular chemistry. It is revealed that a (Z)-isomer of a 2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone-containing tetraphenylethene (TPE-UPy) can be photoisomerized into supramolecular polymer form of its (E)-counterpart in chloroform in a high reaction yield of 68.1%. The yield is further enhanced to 100% in THF as aggregates of supramolecular polymers of (E)-TPE-UPy are formed, which completely inhibits the reverse photoreaction to form (Z)-TPE-UPy. In chloroform with organic acid, a mixture of equal amounts of (E)- and (Z)-isomers was obtained due to the disruption of the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The AIE characteristics of the isomers allow us to directly \u201csee\u201d the \u201cturn-on\u201d photoisomerization process by distinct fluorescence color changes, and the photoisomerization observed here may enable the development of a promising generation of optical power limiting materials.", "Direct Observation of Single Ostwald Ripening Processes by Molecular Dynamics Simulation_2008": "Ostwald ripening is an important growth process in many scientific disciplines ranging from material science, geology, biophysics, and product formulation. Here ripening of argon clusters in a vapor phase is observed directly in constant energy molecular dynamics simulations serving as a model system for large-time scale ripening processes. Starting from an initial metastable equilibrium between the vapor phase and two clusters Ostwald ripening is initiated by the addition of kinetic energy. This mimics local thermal fluctuations in a larger system. It appears that there is not necessarily a close encounter of two clusters before ripening sets in. Also no static density bridge between two ripening clusters is observed. The onset of ripening is rather related to the different evaporation dynamics of clusters of different size. It can start at the moment energy is added or with some delay, depending on the difference in cluster size and dynamics.", "The Pursuit of Science in a Globalized Market: An Approach to Internationally Collaborative Science through Research Abroad Programs_2010": "The past decade has brought about a wave of globalization, which has affected everything from business to education.

Particularly at the graduate level, American students are reluctant to study abroad, which may have a drastic impact on the future of science in America. As a participant in the National Science Foundation\u2019s East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute fellowship program, I was able to experience many of the advantages a science graduate student stands to gain as they take their thesis to another country. Recognizing that a research abroad experience also comes with its risks and difficulties, much of the material presented here aims to facilitate and clarify the process of identifying and completing study abroad programs for science graduate students.

Graphene oxide (GO)-based sensors and catalysts have been considered as a promising candidate in current material science research. However, the sensing and catalytic properties of GO also need to be further improved to satisfy the specific applications, such as gas detection in harsh environments, medical diagnosis based on human breath, blood glucose detection, catalytic activity, and so forth. Therefore, the effect of nitrogen in GO on the performance of glucose and ammonia sensing, and catalytic activity has been investigated. Herein, we propose a practical, high-sensitive sensor and catalyst based on high-quality defect N-enriched GO. One-step, low-cost solvothermal synthesis of N-enriched GO has been exploited for the development of high-performance sensors and excellent catalyst at room temperature. The resultant N-enriched GO (N8GO) has been studied as a promising sensing material for ammonia, glucose, and para-nitrophenol (PNP) reduction. The prevalent outstanding sensing and catalytic performance may be due to the synergistic effect of nitrogen.

Within a two-dimensional framework, we systematically concentrate on the buckled and puckered systems consisting of the VA group elements (denoted as arsenene, antimonene, and bismuthene). Among these studied systems, the buckled antimonene harbors a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 2.15 at room temperature. This is probably the highest value that has ever been reported in pristine 2D materials. By simple biaxial strain engineering, the ZT can even get enhanced to 2.9 under 3% tensile strain. The enhancement mainly results from both tuning the electronic structures and reducing the thermal conductance. This work predicts a new promising candidate in thermoelectric devices, based on the fact that buckled antimonene has been lately fabricated and proved to be stable at ambient conditions.", "Molecular Model for the Self-Assembly of the Cyclic Lipodepsipeptide Pseudodesmin A_2019": "Self-assembly of peptides into supramolecular structures represents an active field of research with potential applications ranging from material science to medicine. Their study typically involves the application of a large toolbox of spectroscopic and imaging techniques. However, quite often, the structural aspects remain underexposed. Besides, molecular modeling of the self-assembly process is usually difficult to handle, since a vast conformational space has to be sampled. Here, we have used an approach that combines short molecular dynamics simulations for peptide dimerization and NMR restraints to build a model of the supramolecular structure from the dimeric units. Experimental NMR data notably provide crucial information about the conformation of the monomeric units, the supramolecular assembly dimensions, and the orientation of the individual peptides within the assembly. This in silico/in vitro mixed approach enables us to define accurate atomistic models of supramolecular structures of the bacterial cyclic lipodepsipeptide pseudodesmin A.", "Tuning Activities of K1.9Na0.1Ta2O6\u00b72H2O Nanocrystals in Photocatalysis by Controlling Exposed Facets_2013": "Morphology-controlled synthesis of tantalates is a major challenge in the field of material science. Herein, an innovative strategy has been developed for controllably synthesizing K1.9Na0.1Ta2O6\u00b72H2O (KNTO) nanocrystals shaped as octahedra and nanosheets without using any capping agents. The obtained nanocrystals show high activity in photocatalytic H2 evolution from CH3OH/H2O solution, and their performance closely depends on the exposed facets, in which the {111}-facet-bounded nanooctahedra exhibit more than 3 times higher activity than the nanosheets dominated with {101} facets. The influence of surface atomic structure and electronic band structure on the photocatalytic properties of the KNTO nanocrystals is systematically studied.

Such a breakthrough is clearly elucidated from the slowing down of highly isotropic molecular motions during plastic-to-rigid transition. The deep understanding of its intrinsic plasticity and superior NLO property allows the construction of a feasible switching mechanism.

X-ray amorphous FeF3 has been shown to be a promising electrode material in Li and Na ion batteries. Providing structural information on this class of compounds is therefore of interest as it can help rationalize the material\u2019s properties and further enabled its optimization. Herein, we used the pair distribution function and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy to provide unique insights into the atomic structure of amorphous FeF3. The results showed that amorphous FeF3 contained two phases built from corner-sharing of FeF6 octahedra. According to X-ray diffraction data, the PDF was successfully modeled based on two structural models related to the distorted ReO3 and the hexagonal-tungsten-bronze networks of FeF3. The lack of long-range order shown by conventional XRD data and PDF analysis was shown to arise mostly from disorder. This study provides detailed atomic structure with corresponding spectroscopic signature of amorphous phases. Quantitative analysis of both techniques indicated similar trends. This showed that our approach can be employed to determine the structure of other complex materials.", "Structural Studies Using Unnatural Oligosaccharides: Toward Sugar Foldamers_2019": "Biopolymers, like DNA and proteins, fold in specific conformations in order to exert complex biological functions. Synthetic modifications are commonly used to alter those conformations and create engineered biomaterials. In stark contrast, the chemical complexity and dynamic nature of polysaccharides have hampered a detailed structural characterization and structure\u2013function correlations are still incomplete. Many synthetic strategies have been developed to access complex unnatural oligosaccharides, capable of mimicking or even improving the properties of the natural counterpart. However, the structural features behind these results are often neglected. This perspective highlights the approaches adopted to develop unnatural glycans, with a particular focus on how the insertion of specific modifications results in more flexible or more constrained structures. Synthetic analogues of natural oligosaccharides could shine light on fundamental structural features. The combination of modern synthetic, computational, and analytical methods will result in novel carbohydrate based foldamers, with defined shape and aggregation behavior.

Yet, there is at present no theoretical framework that permits the identification of flexible structures in the rapidly expanding universe of MOFs. Here, we propose a simple method to predict whether a MOF is flexible, based on treating it as a system of rigid elements, connected by hinges. This proposition is correct in application to MOFs based on rigid carboxylate linkers. We validate the method by correctly classifying known experimental MOFs into rigid and flexible groups. Applied to hypothetical MOFs, the method reveals an abundance of flexibility phenomena, and this seems to be at odds with the proportion of flexible structures among experimentally known MOFs. We speculate that the flexibility of a MOF may constitute an intrinsic impediment on its experimental realization. This highlights the importance of systematic prediction of large amplitude flexibility regimes in MOFs.", "Biogenic Synthesis of Metallic Nanoparticles by Plant Extracts_2013": "In recent years, nanobiotechnology has emerged as an elementary division of modern science and a noval epoch in the fields of material science and is receiving global attention due to its ample applications.

Biological systems such as bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, yeasts, viruses, and plants have been reported to synthesize various metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. Among these, biosynthesis of nanoparticles from plants seems to be a very effective method in developing a rapid, clean, nontoxic, and eco-friendly technology. The use of plant biomass or extracts for the biosynthesis of novel metal nanoparticles (silver, gold, platinum, and palladium) would be more significant if the nanoparticles are synthesized extracellularly and in a controlled manner according to their dispersity of shape and size. Owing to the rich biodiversity of plants, their potential use toward the synthesis of these nobel metal nanoparticles is yet to be explored.

Despite intense research of the thermodynamic self-assembly of ANPs, elucidating their nonequilibrium behaviors under confinement still remains an urgent issue. Here, by performing simulation and theoretical justification, we present for the first time a study of the shear-induced behaviors of Janus spheres (the most elementary ANPs) confined in two-dimensional space. Our results demonstrate that the collective effects of shear and bonding structures can give rise to reshaped cluster configurations, featured by the chiral transition of clusters. Scaling analysis and numerical modeling are performed to quantitatively capture the assembling kinetics of dispersed Janus spheres, thereby suggesting an exotic way to bridge the gap between anisotropic and isotropic particles.

Herein, we report systematic study of peptide sequence\u2212activity relationships for binding to II\u2212VI semiconductors (CdS, CdSe, ZnS, ZnSe) and Au using a yeast surface display system, and we define criteria for tuning peptide affinity and specificity for these material surfaces. First, homohexapeptides of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids were engineered, expressed on yeast surface, and assayed for the ability to bind each material surface in order to define functional groups sufficient for binding. Histidine (H6) was able to mediate binding of yeast to the five materials studied, while tryptophan (W6), cysteine (C6), and methionine (M6) exhibited different levels of binding to single-crystalline ZnS and ZnSe and polycrystalline Au surfaces. The ability of neighboring amino acids to up- and down-modulate histidine binding was then evaluated by use of interdigitated peptides (XHXHXHX). While the 20 amino acids exhibited a unique fingerprint of modulation for each material, some general trends emerged. With neutral defined by alanine, up-modulation occurred with glycine, basic amino acids, and the previously defined binding amino acids histidine, tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine, and down-modulation generally occurred with acidic, polar, and hydrophobic residues. We conclude that certain amino acids directly bind the material surface while neighboring amino acids locally modulate the binding environment for the materials we studied. Therefore, by the specific placement of up- and down-modulating amino acids, material specificity can be controlled. Finally, by employing the compositional and spatial criteria developed herein, it was possible to predictively design peptide sequences with material specificity, including a multimaterial binder, a Au-specific binder, and a ZnS-specific binder, that were verified as such in the context of yeast display.", "Hierarchical Assembly of Nanostructured Organosilicate Networks via Stereocomplexation of Block Copolymers_2007": "The effect of the stereochemistry of polylactide (PLA)-based block copolymers on templated inorganic nanostructures has been investigated from the self-assembly of a stereoisomer pair/organosilicate mixture followed by organosilicate vitrification and copolymer thermolysis. Isomeric PLA homopolymers, block copolymers, and a stereoblock copolymer were prepared by ring-opening polymerization of d-, l-, or rac-lactide using an organocatalytic catalyst. Both differential scanning calorimetry and atomic force microscopy showed the formation of a stereocomplex between enantiomeric stereoisomers, that is, block copolymer/block copolymer and block copolymer/homopolymer mixtures as well as a stereoblock copolymer.

Here, we propose an artificial CC biomineralization system equivalent to the natural one in terms of the primary physicochemical mechanism. Our system is constructed of a polymer gel and a CC solution unsaturated by a dissociated anionic polymer. The gel network consists of proton donor and proton acceptor polymers, which are analogues of polymers in the natural biomineralization system and have affinity for each other through hydrogen bonding interaction. Artificial biomineralization takes place within the polymer gel to produce a monolithic composite of the network and CC, whose powder X-ray diffraction pattern indicates calcite or calcite/vaterite. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy observation of the composite during the mineralization process revealed a two-phase structure (network/CC solid solution phase and CC hypercomplex gel phase). As artificial biomineralization proceeds, the solid phase grows in size at the cost of the gel phase as if the latter is substituted with the former, until the solid phase occupies the whole depth of the composite. These results suggest that the hypercomplex gel is the precursor of the resultant network/CC solid solution, and its discontinuous change is a phase transition to the solid solution. Despite minute differences in higher-order structures between our model system and the natural system, the fundamental structure of CC skeletal tissues in the latter can be interpreted as a network/CC solid solution, whereas that of CC cartilaginous tissues as a CC hypercomplex gel. Then, it can be deduced that, in biomineralization, the CC skeletal tissue is in principle formed via a phase transition of the CC cartilaginous tissue.", "Science of Food and Cooking_2009": "Provides a listing of additional resources available through JCE for exploring food science.", "3D-Printing Crystallographic Unit Cells for Learning Materials Science and Engineering_2015": "Introductory materials science and engineering courses universally include the study of crystal structure and unit cells, which are by their nature highly visual 3D concepts.

Moreover, it was demonstrated that higher mass densities could be used without increasing energy for pumping when using oxidized active material. High mass-loaded flow electrodes (28% carbon content) based on oxidized AC displayed similar viscosities (\u223c21 Pa s) to lower mass-loaded flow electrodes (20% carbon content) based on nonoxidized AC.

Single-crystal structures, absorption spectra, and density functional theory calculations were used to select the plausible addition positions in the radical coupling reaction, which preferentially happens on the carbon atoms with high electron density of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) and positive charge. Temperature-dependent NMR measurements demonstrated unique paramagnetic shifts of the 1H peaks, which were derived from the anisotropic magnetism of the f-electron in the Ce atom of the isomers. It was found that the magnetic anisotropy axes can be easily predicted by theoretical calculations using the Gaussian 09 package. Further analysis revealed that the temperature-dependent trend in the shifts is clearly predictable from the distance and relative position of the proton from the Ce atom. Hence, the Ce-encapsulated metallofullerene Ce@C82 can provide spatial location information about nearby atoms through the temperature-dependent paramagnetic shifts of its NMR signals. It can act as a molecular probe for location sensing by utilizing the anisotropic magnetism of the encapsulated Ce atom. The potentially low toxicity and stability of the endohedral fullerene would make Ce@C82 suitable for applications in biology and material science.", "Science and Global Sustainability as a Course Context for Non-Science Majors_2011": "We have developed a course on Global Sustainability which is offered to non-science majors.

Lack of optical materials compatible with common semiconductor substrates, however, presents a standing hurdle for integrated photonic device development in the mid-infrared domain. Tellurene, atomically thin crystals of elemental tellurium, is an emerging 2-D material amenable to scalable solution-based synthesis. It uniquely combines small and tunable bandgap energies, high carrier mobility, exceptionally large electro-optic activity, and superior chemical stability, making it a promising and versatile material platform for mid-infrared photonics. With these material properties in mind, we propose and design a waveguide-integrated tellurene photodetector and Pockels effect modulator. The photodetector boasts a record room temperature noise equivalent power of 0.03 fW/Hz1/2 at 3 \u03bcm wavelength, while the optimized modulator device claims a half-wave voltage-length product (V\u03c0\u00b7L) of 2.7 V\u00b7cm and a switching energy of 12.0 pJ/bit, both representing substantial improvements to current state-of-the-art devices.", "Coating plus doping improves battery material_2016": "Atomic layer deposition (ALD), a well-studied layer-by-layer method for depositing thin films on solids, is prized for its ability to form ultrathin films that conform perfectly to oddly shaped and tough-to-coat solid surfaces. A study finds that not only does ALD coat materials with a film-forming compound, but also it can penetrate the solid, doping the material. This combination of coating and doping can improve lithium-ion battery materials (Sci. Rep. 2016, DOI: 10.1038/srep25293). LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) has drawn significant attention as a candidate Li-ion battery cathode material because of its low cost, high theoretical charge capacity, and high operating voltage relative to other commonly studied cathode materials, including LiMn2O4, which has been used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicle batteries.

Here we demonstrate that spin-coated polycrystalline organic semiconducting films with a layered molecular packing structure can exhibit a hyperbolic dispersion over a wide spectral range and support the presence of surface excitonic polaritons. This was evidenced from 670 to 920 nm and is related to the negative real part of the dielectric permittivity of the selected quinoidal organic semiconductor. In addition, the accessible high k modes lead to changes in the spontaneous emission decay rate and photoluminescence quantum yield of emitters placed nearby the organic monolithic (composed of only one molecule and not necessitating an alternating multilayer structure) natural hyperbolic material.

The most important quantity to determine is the size of the structures that hinder the Brownian motion of the molecules. We study three qualitatively different models of restricted diffusion, widely applied in biophysics and material science: Diffusion constrained by elastic force (i), walking confined diffusion (ii), and hop diffusion (iii). They cover the diversity of statistical behaviors, from purely Gaussian (i) to sharply non-Gaussian on intermediate time scales (ii) and, additionally, discrete (iii). We test whether one can use the Gaussian approximation of the FCS autocorrelation function to interpret the non-Gaussian data. We show that (i\u2013iii) have approximately the same mean square displacements. Using simulations, we show that the FCS data suspected of restricted diffusion can be reliably interpreted using one archetypal model (i). Even if the underlying mechanism of the restriction is different or unknown, the accuracy of fitting the confinement size is excellent, and diffusion coefficients are also estimated with a good accuracy. This study gives a physical insight into the statistical behavior of different types of restricted diffusion and into the ability of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to distinguish between them.", "Synthesis, Structural, and Transport Properties of Cr-Doped BaTi2As2O_2014": "The interplay between unconventional superconductivity and the ordering of charge/spin density wave is one of the most vital issues in both condensed matter physics and material science.

However, it typically has been limited to a fixed excitation wavelength. We demonstrate excitation-dependent hyperspectral imaging by implementing a wavelength-tunable laser to our TERS setup. Varying the excitation wavelength during the TERS experiments is a key to perform spatially resolved resonant Raman scattering with nanometer resolution, which enables mapping of transition centers and to study, for example, the quantum properties of electrons and phonons. To present the application potential and to verify the setup, we recorded excitation-dependent hyperspectral nanoimages of a densely packed film of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on an Au surface and use the spectral position and intensity of the radial breathing modes for a unique assignment of the CNTs. We succeeded in identifying and imaging at least nine different tube species.

In the present study, single cross-linked gelatin\u2013oxidized tannic acid (SC-GT/OTA) hydrogels were fabricated through covalent cross-linking between gelatin and tannic acid (TA) oxidized by using sodium periodate (NaIO4). Double cross-linked gelatin\u2013OTA\u2013FeCl3\u00b76H2O (DC-GT/OTA/FeIII) hydrogels were also created using metal coordination bonds formed between the catechol groups present in OTA and FeIII in ferric chloride.

Moreover, the maximum values of compressive stress of SC-GT/OTA hydrogels increased significantly by almost seven times the original value as the molar ratio of NaIO4 to TA increased from 3:1 to 5:1. When the molar ratio of NaIO4 to TA was maintained at the constant of 4:1, the storage modulus values of DC-GT/OTA/FeIII hydrogels with the FeIII-to-TA molar ratio of 1.5:1 were three to 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of SC-GT/OTA hydrogels in the whole angular frequency range.

Clinical and laboratory studies show that topological features of the surface profoundly influence cellular responses; for example, titanium surfaces with nano- and microtopographical structures enhance osteoblast attachment and host\u2013implant integration as compared to a smooth surface. To understand how cells and tissues respond to different topographical features, it is of critical importance to directly visualize the cell\u2013material interface at the relevant nanometer length scale. Here, we present a method for in situ examination of the cell-to-material interface at any desired location, based on focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy imaging to resolve the cell membrane-to-material interface with 10 nm resolution. By examining how cell membranes interact with topographical features such as nanoscale protrusions or invaginations, we discovered that the cell membrane readily deforms inward and wraps around protruding structures, but hardly deforms outward to contour invaginating structures. This asymmetric membrane response (inward vs outward deformation) causes the cleft width between the cell membrane and the nanostructure surface to vary by more than an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that surface topology is a crucial consideration for the development of medical implants or biosensors whose performances are strongly influenced by the cell-to-material interface.

The diffusion exhibited a distinct ledge migration by surface diffusion at [001]-ZnO while continuous migration with slight/no ledges by inner diffusion at [100]-ZnO. The process is explained based on thermodynamic evaluation and growth kinetics.

The characterization of these particles can be challenging because conventional electrophoresis theory is usually based on drastic assumptions that are unable to realistically describe the actual situation. In this study, the influence of the nonuniform charged conditions on the surface of a particle at an arbitrary level of surface potential and double layer thickness on its electrophoretic behavior is investigated for the first time in the literature taking account of the effect of double-layer polarization. Several important results are observed. For instance, for the same averaged surface potential, the mobility of a nonuniformly charged particle is generally smaller than that of a uniformly charged particle, and the difference between the two depends upon the thickness of double layer. This implies that using the conventional electrophoresis theory may result in appreciable deviation, which can be on the order of ca. 20%. In addition, the nonuniform surface charge can yield double vortex in the vicinity of a particle by breaking the symmetric of the flow field, which has potential applications in mixing and/or regulating the medium confined in a submicrometer-sized space, where conventional mixing devices are inapplicable.", "Adsorbed Organic Material and Its Control on Wettability_2016": "Laboratory core flood and field scale tests have demonstrated that 5\u201340% more oil can be released from sandstone reservoirs by injecting low salinity water, rather than high salinity fluids, such as seawater or formation water. The effect has been explained by a change in wettability of the minerals that form the pore surfaces, as a result of the decrease in divalent cation concentration. We have previously demonstrated that, even for solvent cleaned core samples, mineral surfaces retain a significant quantity of carbon containing material and this affects wettability and response to changed salinity. Here we quantified the response of sandstone core plug material in its preserved state (i.e., after storage in kerosene) and after the same core plug material was treated with ethanol and ozone to remove adsorbed organic compounds. We used the chemical force microscopy (CFM) mode of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to directly measure the adhesion force for two types of molecules on pore surfaces of individual sand grains that were plucked from an oil reservoir core plug. We functionalized AFM tips with alkane or carboxylate, so they resembled tiny oil droplets and measured adhesion to the sand grain surfaces in artificial seawater (ASW; 35,600 ppm) and in ASW diluted to \u223c1,500 ppm (ASW-low). Both before and after the ethanol/ozone treatment, and for both the alkane and the carboxylate functionalized tips, the adhesion was lower in ASW diluted to \u223c1,500 ppm than in ASW. For both alkane and carboxylate, the difference in adhesion between ASW and ASW-low was higher before the ethanol/ozone treatment. We attribute this change in response to the salinity dependent force caused mainly by the electric double layer (EDL) at the sand grain surfaces. We interpret the higher adhesion difference, before a very thorough ethanol/ozone treatment, to be a result of the loss of the organic material that was originally adsorbed on these surfaces, which adds to the charge density and thereby to the salinity dependent EDL force. Investigating the same area on the same pore surface, before and after removal of the organic material, demonstrates without doubt that it is organic material that causes the low salinity response, not the underlying mineral surface.", "The Kresge-Hooker Science Library_1961": "The history of the Kresge-Hooker Science Library at Wayne State University is briefly reviewed.

To help address these challenges, we developed an integrated outreach program, spanning grades 6\u201312, designed to engage students by bringing students to the University of Oregon to perform hands-on laboratory experiments. Initially developed to supplement science education lost to state-mandated furlough days, the programmatic design can be applied readily in other contexts including afterschool, weekend, or summer programs. The outreach activities and scaffolding rely heavily on near-peer mentoring, which provides a visible pathway for younger students to envision themselves as future scientists while also providing mentoring and leadership opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The use of near-peer mentoring is also critically important for the program\u2019s sustainability because it enables a more efficient allocation of graduate student and faculty time.

Herein, we, for the first time, discovered the photothermal effect of an iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs)-mediated TMB (3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine)-H2O2 colorimetric system, and applied it toward the development of a new NP-mediated photothermal immunoassay platform for visual quantitative biomolecule detection using a thermometer as the signal reader. Using a sandwich-type proof-of-concept immunoassay, we found that the charge transfer complex of the iron oxide NPs-mediated one-electron oxidation product of TMB (oxidized TMB) exhibited not only color changes, but also a strong near-infrared (NIR) laser-driven photothermal effect. Hence, oxidized TMB was explored as a new sensitive photothermal probe to convert the immunoassay signal into heat through the near-infrared laser-driven photothermal effect, enabling simple photothermal immunoassay using a thermometer. Based on the new iron oxide NPs-mediated TMB-H2O2 photothermal immunoassay platform, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a model biomarker can be detected at a concentration as low as 1.0 ng\u00b7mL\u20131 in normal human serum.

Because GO is a promising solution-processable precursor for the bulk production of graphene, interest in this old material has resurged. The reactions to produce GO add oxygenated functional groups to the graphene sheets on their basal plane and edges, and this derivatization breaks the \u03c0-conjugated network, resulting in electrically insulating but highly water-dispersible sheets.\nApart from making graphene, GO itself has many intriguing properties. Like graphene, GO is a two-dimensional (2D) sheet with feature sizes at two abruptly different length scales. The apparent thickness of the functionalized carbon sheet is approximately 1 nm, but the lateral dimensions can range from a few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. Therefore, researchers can think of GO as either a single molecule or a particle, depending on which length scale is of greater interest. At the same time, GO can be viewed as an unconventional soft material, such as a 2D polymer, highly anisotropic colloid, membrane, liquid crystal, or amphiphile.\nIn this Account, we highlight the soft material characteristics of GO. GO consists of nanographitic patches surrounded by largely disordered, oxygenated domains. Such structural characteristics effectively make GO a 2D amphiphile with a hydrophilic periphery and largely hydrophobic center. This insight has led to better understanding of the solution properties of GO for making thin films and new applications of GO as a surfactant. Changes in pH and sheet size can tune the amphiphilicity of GO, leading to intriguing interfacial activities. In addition, new all-carbon composites made of only graphitic nanostructures using GO as a dispersing agent have potential applications in photovoltaics and energy storage. On the other hand, GO can function as a 2D random diblock copolymer, one block graphitic and the other heavily hydroxylated. Therefore, GO can guide material assembly through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the selective etching of the more reactive sp3 blocks produces a porous GO network, which greatly enhances interactions with gas molecules in chemical sensors. With their high aspect ratio, GO colloids can readily align to form liquid crystalline phases at high concentration.\nAs single-atomic, water-dispersible, soft carbon sheets that can be easily converted to a conductive form, this 2D material should continue to inspire many curiosity-driven discoveries and applications at the interfaces of chemistry, materials science, and other disciplines.", "The Latino Science Recruitment Project: A prototype for future science education_1990": "This student-initiated program is designed to address the problem of minority under-representation in the science fields.

Their unique crystal structure and ability to physically see growth make for a unique undergraduate laboratory experience. This experiment uses dendrite growth to explore the physical and chemical driving forces behind dendrite growth through a set of viscous, supersaturated solutions of varying ammonium chloride and gelatin concentrations. The degree of NH4Cl supersaturation determines growth rate, which can be mediated by the gelatin limiting diffusional mass transfer. This exercise was designed for a material science course, though it could easily be adapted to an inorganic or general chemistry course. Through this experiment, students are introduced to optical microscopy for quantitative analysis, a common, inexpensive analytical research tool rarely seen in the undergraduate laboratory. When chemical driving forces are dominant (low gelatin, high salt concentrations), a more ordered dendrite structure forms, with primary branches at 90\u00b0 angles. Conversely, as diffusion becomes more dominant, a more disordered, denser dendrite structure is observed and the growth rate is slower. Students use both qualitative and quantitative observations to make connections between a fundamental laboratory exercise and critical materials processing techniques that rely on physicochemical driving forces.", "Protein Assembly: Versatile Approaches to Construct Highly Ordered Nanostructures_2016": "Nature endows life with a wide variety of sophisticated, synergistic, and highly functional protein assemblies.

Ultimately, we present real solutions to this education dilemma, and provide a number of resources that climate science educators can readily implement.", "ILQINS Hexapeptide, Identified in Lysozyme Left-Handed Helical Ribbons and Nanotubes, Forms Right-Handed Helical Ribbons and Crystals_2014": "Amyloid fibrils are implicated in over 20 neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanisms of fibril structuring and formation are not only of medical and biological importance but are also relevant for material science and nanotechnologies due to the unique structural and physical properties of amyloids. We previously found that hen egg white lysozyme, homologous to the disease-related human lysozyme, can form left-handed giant ribbons, closing into nanotubes. By using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry analysis, we here identify a key component of such structures: the ILQINS hexapeptide. By combining atomic force microscopy and circular dichorism, we find that this fragment, synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis, also forms fibrillar structures in water at pH 2. However, all fibrillar structures formed possess an unexpected right-handed twist, a rare chirality within the corpus of amyloid experimental observations. We confirm by small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations that these fibrils are composed of conventional left-handed \u03b2-sheets, but that packing stresses between adjacent sheets create this twist of unusual handedness. We also show that the right-handed fibrils represent a metastable state toward \u03b2-sheet-based microcrystals formation.", "Trapping in a Material World_2016": "The ability to manipulate small particles of matter using the forces of light, optical trapping, forms the basis of a number of exciting research areas, spanning fundamental physics, applied chemistry and medicine and biology. Historically, a largely unexplored area has been the influence of the material properties of the particle on the optical forces. By taking a holistic approach in which the properties of the particle are considered alongside those of the light field, the force field on a particle can be optimized, allowing significant increases of the optical forces exerted and even the introduction of new forces, torques, and other physical effects. Here we present an introduction to this newly emerging area, with a focus on high refractive index and antireflection coated particles, nanomaterial particles, including metallic nanoparticles, optically anisotropic particles, and metamaterials.

How to synthesize a novel, safe, biodegradable, and biocompatible material to replace synthetic materials is of interest in fields of food, biomedicine, and material science. In this study, we successfully fabricated two series of novel and multifunctional-modified starch nanoparticles (MPN@DBS-NPs and MPN@SNCs) by introducing MPN coatings to debranched starch nanoparticles (DBS-NPs) or starch nanocrystals (SNCs) based on the reaction coordinates of the tannic acid (TA) and iron ions. The resulting MPN@DBS-NP and MPN@SNC, each with a spherical shape, measured approximately 75\u201395 and 110\u2013125 nm in diameter, respectively. Moreover, these nanoparticles provided a negligible release of TA at both a neutral pH (7.4) and an alkaline pH (9.0), as well as a highly efficient release at physiologically relevant acidic pH levels (1.2, 3.0, and 5.0). By utilizing the unique nature of TA, the functionalized surface modification strategy provided the DBS-NP and SNC with excellent antioxidant bioactivity. Notably, significant effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were observed. Cell assays confirmed that MPN@DBS-NP exhibited nontoxicity and high biocompatibility. Together, the cytocompatibility, antioxidant, and antibacterial characteristics of the novel pH-sensitive-modified starch make them promising candidates for food and biomedical applications.", "Science Punditry from NAS_1991": "After reading \"Headline News, Science Views,\" I could in full honesty write this promotional blurb for it: \" 'Headline News . . .

The properties and thus the use of these molecules are determined by coordinating metal ions and ligand substituents.

Now, a major bottleneck in the materials discovery pipeline arises in connecting new results with the previously established literature.

To this end, we apply text mining with named entity recognition (NER) for large-scale information extraction from the published materials science literature.

This work develops a new theoretical method, namely, variable-cell double-ended surface walking (VC-DESW) to locate the transition state (TS) and deduce the pathway in solid phase transition. Inherited from the DESW method ( J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013, 9, 5745) for molecular systems, the VC-DESW method implements an efficient mechanism to couple the lattice and atom degrees of freedom. The method features with fast pseudopathway building and accurate TS location for solid phase transition systems without requiring expensive Hessian computation and iterative pathway optimization. A generalized coordinate, consisting of the lattice vectors and the scaled atomic coordinates, is designed for describing the crystal potential energy surface (PES), which is able to capture the anisotropic behavior in phase transition. By comparing with the existing method for solid phase transition in different systems, we show that the VC-DESW method can be much more efficient for finding the TS in crystal phase transition. With the combination of the recently developed unbiased stochastic surface walking pathway sampling method, the VC-DESW is further utilized to resolve the lowest energy pathway of SiO2 \u03b1-quartz to quartz-II phase transition from many likely reaction pathways.

It requires the assessment of the mass reduction potential of automotive materials, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their production and recycling, and their impact on GHG emissions from vehicle use. The model presented in this paper is based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and completely parameterized, i.e., its computational structure is separated from the required input data, which is not traditionally done in LCAs. The parameterization increases scientific rigor and transparency of the assessment methodology, facilitates sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the results, and also makes it possible to compare different studies and explain their disparities. The state of the art of the modeling methodology is reviewed and advanced. Assessment of the GHG emission impacts of material recycling through consequential system expansion shows that our understanding of this issue is still incomplete.

In the S-approach, possible fluorescence recovery scenarios are primarily simulated and afterward compared with a real measurement while optimizing parameters of a model until a sufficient match is achieved. This makes it possible to reveal multifractional molecular diffusion. Fluorescent latex particles of different size and fluorescein isothiocyanate in an aqueous medium were utilized as test systems. Finally, the S-approach has been used to evaluate diffusion of cytochrome c loaded into multilayers made of hyaluronan and polylysine.

A selection rule among surface chemistries is compatibility between a surface functionalization tool and a target material. For example, alkanethiol deposition on noble metal surfaces, widely known as the formation of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), cannot be performed on oxide material surfaces. One must choose organosilane molecules to functionalize oxide surfaces. Thus, the surface chemistry strictly depends on the properties of the surface. Polydopamine coating is now generally accepted as the first toolbox for functionalization of virtually any material surface. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is a widely used method to modify properties of versatile surfaces, including organic materials, metal oxides, and noble metals, along with polydopamine coating. On flat solid substrates, the two chemistries of polydopamine coating and LbL assembly provide similar levels of surface modifications. However, there are additional distinct features in polydopamine. First, polydopamine coating is effective for two- or three-dimensional porous materials such as metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), synthetic polyolefin membranes, and others because small-sized dopamine (MW = 153.18 u) and its oxidized oligomers are readily attached onto narrow-spaced surfaces without exhibiting steric hindrance. In contrast, polymers used in LbL assembly are slow in diffusion because of steric hindrance due to their high molecular weight. Second, it is applicable to structurally nonflat surfaces showing special wettability such as superhydrophobicity or superoleophobicity. Third, a nonconducting, insulating polydopamine layer can be converted to be a conducting layer by pyrolysis. The product after pyrolysis is a N-doped graphene-like material that is useful for graphene or carbon nanotube-containing composites. Fourth, it is a suitable method for engineering the surface properties of various composite materials. The surface properties of participating components in composite materials can be unified by polydopamine coating with a simple one-step process. Fifth, a polydopamine layer exhibits intrinsic chemical reactivity by the presence of catecholquinone moieties and catechol radical species on surfaces. Nucleophiles such as amine and thiolate spontaneously react with the functionalized layer.\nApplications of polydopamine coating are exponentially growing and include cell culture/patterning, microfluidics, antimicrobial surfaces, tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, photothermal therapy, immobilization of photocatalysts, Li-ion battery membranes, Li\u2013sulfur battery cathode materials, oil/water separation, water detoxification, organocatalysts, membrane separation technologies, carbonization, and others.

A tenet of hydrophobic attraction is the release of an ordered water layer, leading to a dry contact between two hydrophobic surfaces. Although the water-free contact has been inferred from numerous experimental and theoretical studies, this has not been directly measured. Here, we use surface sensitive sum frequency generation spectroscopy to directly probe the contact interface between hydrophobic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and two hydrophobic surfaces (a self-assembled monolayer, OTS, and a polymer coating, PVNODC). We show that the interfacial structures for OTS and PVNODC are identical in dry contact but that they differ dramatically in wet contact. In water, the PVNODC surface partially rearranges at grain boundaries, trapping water at the contact interface leading to a 50% reduction in adhesion energy compared to OTS\u2013PDMS contact. The Young\u2013Dupr\u00e9 equation, used extensively to calculate the thermodynamic work of adhesion, predicts no differences between the adhesion energy for these two hydrophobic surfaces, indicating a failure of this well-known equation when there is a heterogeneous contact.

Its inverse, resource intensity (resource per GDP) has the reverse behavior, with higher values indicating environmentally inefficient economies.

We demonstrate that different types of materials and energy exhibit fundamentally different behaviors, depending on their international income elasticities of consumption. Biomass is completely inelastic, whereas fossil fuels tend to scale proportionally with income. Total materials or energy, as aggregates, have intermediate behavior, depending on the share of fossil fuels and other elastic resources.

Experimental anticrossing measurements using the absorption-dominated extinction signal provide the ultimate evidence for plexciton hybridization in the strong coupling regime. Spatially resolved EELS maps reveal the existence of unexpected nanoscale variations in the deep-subwavelength nature of plexcitons generated by this system.

Nevertheless, there are downsides in using such phenolic compounds for surface modification such as formation of nonuniform coatings, need for multistep modification, and restricted possibilities for postfunctionalization. In this study, inspired by a strong binding ability of natural polyphenols found in plants, we used three different macrocyclic polyphenols, known as resorcin[4]arenes, to modify the surface of different substrates by simple dip-coating into the dilute solution of these compounds. Eight hydroxyl groups on the large rim of these resorcin[4]arenes provide multiple anchoring points to the surface, whereas the lower rim decorated with different appending groups introduces the desired chemical and physical functionalities to the substrate\u2019s surface. Deposition of a uniform and transparent resorcinarene layer on the surface was confirmed by several surface characterization techniques. Incubation of the modified substrates in different environments indicated that the stability of the resorcinarene layer was dependent on the type of substrate and the pH value. The most stable resorcinarene layer was formed on amine-functionalized substrates. The surface was modified with alkenyl functional groups in one step using a resorcinarene compound possessing four alkenyl appending groups on its small rim.

The structural and dynamic properties of water at an interface have been proven to be significantly difference than those of bulk water. However, the exact nature of these interfacial water adlayers at ambient conditions is still under debate. Recent scanning probe microscopy (SPM) experiments, where two-dimensional (2D) materials as ultrathin coatings are utilized to assist the visualization of interfacial water adlayers, have made remarkable progress on interfacial water and started to clarify some of these fundamental scientific questions.\nIn this Account, we review the recently conducted research exploring the properties of confined water between 2D materials and various surfaces under ambient conditions. Initially, we review the earlier studies of water adsorbed on hydrophilic substrates under ambient conditions in the absence of 2D coating materials, which shows the direct microscopic results. Subsequently, we focus on the studies of water adlayer growth at both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates in the presence of 2D coating materials. Ice-like water adlayers confined between hydrophobic graphene and hydrophilic substrates can be directly observed in detail by SPM. It was found that the packing structure of the water adlayer was determined by the hydrophilic substrates, while the orientation of intercalation water domains was directed by the graphene coating. In contrast to hydrophilic substrates, liquid-like nanodroplets confined between hydrophobic graphene and hydrophobic substrates appear close to step edges and atomic-scale surface defects, indicating that atomic-scale surface defects play significant roles in determining the adsorption of water on hydrophobic substrates. In addition, we also review the phenomena of confined water between 2D hydrophilic MoS2 and the hydrophilic substrate.

Wood smoke and mobile source emissions dominated the contribution to the non-volatile fraction of the PM2.5, with about equal contributions for each, but very different diurnal patterns for the two contributions. The diurnal patterns for the attribution were consistent with the emission patterns for these two sources. In addition, the oil refineries contributed about 10% of the primary PM2.5 at Bountiful.

The films were prepared by deposition onto the ATR elements of particles produced by reaction of isoprene with hydroxyl radicals and of \u03b1-pinene with ozone in the Harvard Environmental Chamber (HEC). The infrared spectra showed that the isoprene-derived film had strong hydroxyl absorptions whereas the \u03b1-pinene-derived film had strong carbonyl absorptions. The organic films were exposed to dry and humid flows of ozone, as well as to ultraviolet irradiation, to mimic reactive aging processes that can occur in the troposphere. Both the isoprene- and \u03b1-pinene-derived films were nonreactive with respect to ozone exposure, for both dry and humid conditions, indicating that the secondary organic material consisted mostly of saturated organic species. Both films, however, were susceptible to aging by ultraviolet radiation possibly due to the presence of organic hydroperoxides, and all functional groups other than carbonyls decreased upon irradiation. In regard to hygroscopicity, as a benchmark the ratio xW_CO for oxalic acid of the intensity of the water-bending peak to that of carbonyl absorption (arising from carboxylic acids) was recorded from 20% to 80% relative humidity (RH).

Defects, such as part lattice distortions, local cation disordering and atomic ununiformity, often aggravate the further structural changes upon cycling. In this paper, we found that PEG contributed to form better layered structure, well crystallinity, uniform composition and polyhedral nanoparticles for Li[Li0.15Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 (LNMO). On the basis of the comparative trial, a mechanism of electronegativity difference is proposed to elucidate cation nonuniform distribution. Higher electronegativity of Ni (1.91) than Mn (1.55) show a stronger ability of attraction between Ni and O atoms, and then led to Ni atoms show stronger diffusion driving force toward particle surface to contact the rich O atoms during sintering in air. However, PEG polymer can form a better barrier for more O atoms to attract Ni and Mn atoms on particle surface so that facilitated a uniform distribution. The electrochemical test indicated that the decay of discharge capacity and working voltage was mitigated, which was identified by the result of HRTEM analysis that the initial less defect structure obviously retarded the phase transformation from the layered to spinel after 50 cycles. Therefore, defects are crucial for understanding the voltage fade and capacity decay, and the improvement of performance also demonstrates that designing optimum compositions and ordering atomic arrangements will contribute to stabilize the surface structure and restrain inherent phase transitions.", "Novel Porous Ceramic Material via Burning of Polylactide/Layered Silicate Nanocomposite_2002": "The work presented here is the summary of a 3 year study that aimed to uncover how students\u2019 perception of science changes with the chance to participate in a mini-conference that is incorporated into the biochemistry lecture course.

Chemists have known the basic concept for a long time, but it has recently attracted additional attention, especially in the context of micro- and nanoscience. In this Account, we introduce the fundamentals of bipolar electrochemistry and illustrate its recent applications, with a particular focus on the fields of materials science and dynamic systems.\nJanus particles, named after the Roman god depicted with two faces, are currently in theheart of many original investigations. These objects exhibit different physicochemical properties on two opposite sides. This makes them a unique class of materials, showing interesting features. They have received increasing attention from the materials science community, since they can be used for a large variety of applications, ranging from sensing to photosplitting of water. So far the great majority of methods developed for the generation of Janus particles breaks the symmetry by using interfaces or surfaces. The consequence is often a low time-space yield, which limits their large scale production. In this context, chemists have successfully used bipolar electrodeposition to break the symmetry. This provides a single-step technique for the bulk production of Janus particles with a high control over the deposit structure and morphology, as well as a significantly improved yield. In this context, researchers have used the bipolar electrodeposition of molecular layers, metals, semiconductors, and insulators at one or both reactive poles of bipolar electrodes to generate a wide range of Janus particles with different size, composition and shape.\nIn using bipolar electrochemistry as a driving force for generating motion, its intrinsic asymmetric reactivity is again the crucial aspect, as there is no directed motion without symmetry breaking. Controlling the motion of objects at the micro- and nanoscale is of primary importance for many potential applications, ranging from medical diagnosis to nanosurgery, and has generated huge interest in the scientific community in recent years. Several original approaches to design micro- and nanomotors have been explored, with propulsion strategies based on chemical fuelling or on external fields. The first strategy is using the asymmetric particles generated by bipolar electrodeposition and employing them directly as micromotors. We have demonstrated this by using the catalytic and magnetic properties of Janus objects. The second strategy is utilizing bipolar electrochemistry as a direct trigger of motion of isotropic particles. We developed mechanisms based on a simultaneous dissolution and deposition, or on a localized asymmetric production of bubbles. We then used these for the translation, the rotation and the levitation of conducting objects. These examples give insight into two interesting fields of applications of the concept of bipolar electrochemistry, and open perspectives for future developments in materials science and for generating motion at different scales.", "Development of Certified Reference Material for Quantification of Two Pesticides in Brown Rice_2009": "Enzymatic catalysis on the insoluble substrates commonly suffers from low enzyme stability, catalytic activity, and product recovery.

We demonstrate the remarkable advantages of this new method in cellulosic hydrolysis. The responsive DNA material has a solution to gel transition temperature at 13 \u00b0C. Therefore, the cellulase (CEL) can be on-demand switched between the mobile state, enabling high reactivity, and fixed state, facilitating CEL recovery and reuse. As a result, this system showed good catalytic activity and operational stability even at extremely high cellulose concentrations (100 mg/mL).

Prerecorded CDs and DVDs, where the data is stored as a series of pits physically stamped into a plastic disc, have required new optically-clear grades of the base plastic, technically sophisticated UV acrylic adhesives and lacquers, and a detailed understanding of the surface energy and the optical and electrochemical properties of metals in very thin layers. The different recordable formats have all needed new chemistry for the recording layer: cyanine and phthalocyanine dyes for write-once discs, low-melting alloys with a glassy state for erasable discs, and magnetic materials with closely defined Curie temperatures and hysteresis for MO and minidiscs.

The neural network technique will be enhanced with the use of a simulation computer program for creating the training data set. This simulation approach provides the opportunity of including outliers of various types in a data set for training the neural network because an actual process data set used for training possibly may not have outliers. In this paper, the methods will be compared on their ability to identify outliers and reduce false alarms. These methods were tested on data sets of nuclear material balances with known removals, and the results are tabulated and described.

Aggregate-resistant properties of 3D MXene not only double the surface area without loss of the intrinsic properties of MXene but also render the characteristics such as kinetics-favorable framework, high robustness, and excellent processability in both solution and solid state.

The NTCM was obtained using C60-fullerene modified silica gels as hard templates, which were embedded in a phenolic resin containing a metal catalyst for localized graphitization, followed by bulk carbonization, and template and catalyst removal. TEM, SEM, and BET measurements revealed that NTCM possessed an integrated open hierarchical porous structure, with a trimodal pore distribution. This porous material also possessed a high mesopore volume and narrow mesopore size distribution. During the course of carbonization, the C60 conjugated to aminated silica was partly decomposed, leading to the formation of micropores.

Although researchers have developed many ways of generating single atomic layer carbon sheets, chemical exfoliation of graphite powders to graphene oxide (GO) sheets followed by deoxygenation to form chemically modified graphene (CMG) offers a promising route for bulk scale production. The materials processing, which we broadly define as the physical and chemical means to tailor a material\u2019s chemical and microstructures, enables us to control the properties in bulk CMG materials. For example, by processing CMG sheets in different solvents, we can make thin films, blend CMG sheets with other materials, and modify them by chemical reactions. Materials processing methods also allow us to control the interactions between CMG sheets for the assembly of large scale two- or three-dimensional structures with desirable microstructures.\nThis Account highlights a few problems associated with large scale production and processing of GO and CMG. First, we briefly discuss the potential fire risk of GO and CMG when alkaline salt byproducts are not completely removed. These impurities can catalyze carbon combustion. We introduce an improved purification procedure that effectively removes the byproducts and speeds up the production. Next, we address the challenges of imaging GO and CMG sheets on common substrates such as glass and plastics using standard microscopy methods. We have introduced a new technique fluorescence quenching microscopy (FQM), which allows us to observe graphene-based sheets with both high throughput and high contrast on arbitrary substrates and even in solution. Then we focus on how to prevent aggregation in CMG. Aggregation greatly reduces the material processability and accessible surface area, which degrades the material properties. We introduce two strategies to reduce aggregation by (i) reducing the lateral dimension of the sheets to nanometer range to enhance their colloidal stability and (ii) crumpling the sheets into paper ball-like, fractal-dimensional particles to make them aggregation-resistant in both solvents and solid state, even after mechanical compression.\nSolutions to these material processing challenges can pave the way for further research and development.

Despite the widely observed sluggish Mg2+ diffusion in most oxide lattices, recent first-principles calculations predicted low diffusion barriers in the calcium ferrite (CF)-type post-spinel structures. In the present work, we experimentally examine the prospect of CF-type NaV1.25Ti0.75O4 as a Mg cathode. The Na+ ions, which lie in the ion migration pathway, need to be removed or exchanged with Mg2+ to allow Mg2+ de/intercalation. Partial desodiation was achieved through chemical and electrochemical methods, as proven by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, but deep desodiation was accompanied by partial amorphization of the material. Mg2+ ion exchange at moderate temperature (80 \u00b0C) resulted in the formation of Na0.19Mg0.41V1.25Ti0.75O4; however, phase transformation was observed when higher temperatures were applied to attempt complete ion exchange. Such phenomena point to the instability of the CF lattice when the tunnel is empty or occupied by a small ion (Mg2+). Thus, while the low migration barrier predicted by computation is partly based on the relative metastability of the theoretical CF-MgxV1.25Ti0.75O4 lattice, the difficulty in stabilizing it also renders the material synthetically nonaccessible, hindering this post-spinel\u2019s application as an electrode material.", "The Pulp Mill of the Future\u2014Environmental and Raw Material Considerations_1977": "Bioinspired polymeric materials are attracting increasing attention due to significant advantages over their natural counterparts: the ability to precisely tune their structures over a broad range of chemical and physical properties, increased stability, and improved processability. Polypeptoids, a promising class of bioinspired polymer based on a N-substituted glycine backbone, have a number of unique properties that bridge the material gap between proteins and bulk polymers. Peptoids combine the sequence specificity of biopolymers with the simpler intra/intermolecular interactions and robustness of traditional synthetic polymers. They are highly designable because hundreds of chemically diverse side chains can be introduced from simple building blocks. Peptoid polymers can be prepared by two distinct synthetic techniques offering access to two material subclasses: (1) automated solid-phase synthesis which enables precision sequence control and near absolute monodispersity up to chain lengths of \u223c50 monomers, and (2) a classical polymerization approach which allows access to higher molecular weights and larger-scale yields, but with less control over length and sequence.

However, systematic investigations into the binding energies, site distribution, and their correlation with the molecular-level surface assemblages and structures at interfaces and in nanopores are rarely documented. In this review, we summarize a set of systematic calorimetric studies on surface energetics we performed during the past decade. These studies demonstrate how thermochemistry can reveal crucial energetic insights into a series of molecule\u2013material interactions relevant to a number of applications, including carbon capture and sequestration, energy production, sustainable chemical processing, catalysis, and nanogeoscience. Calorimetric methodologies developed and applied include direct gas adsorption calorimetry, near-room temperature solvent immersion/solution calorimetry, and high temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry. Using these highly unique techniques, we reveal the thermodynamic complexity of carbon dioxide capture on metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) sorbents with built-in and grafted nucleophilic functional groups (\u2212OH and \u2212NH2). These studies suggest that carbon dioxide adsorption on functionalized MOFs is a complex process involving multiple thermodynamic factors, as reflected by changes in surface phase and structure, chemical bonding, and degree of disorder with varying temperature and gas loading. The fundamental insights obtained may help optimize the design, synthesis, and application of MOF-based carbon dioxide sorbents for carbon capture and sequestration. In parallel, we also explore the energetics of interaction and competition between small molecules (water, carbon dioxide, methane, and simple and complex organics) and inorganic materials (calcite, silica, zirconia, zeolites, mesoporous frameworks, alumina, and uranium), at interfaces and in nanopores. Combined with spectroscopic, diffraction, electron microscopic, and computational techniques, the energetics of gas/liquid\u2013solid interactions can be correlated with specific bonds, molecular configurations, and nanostructures. Although the energetics evolves continuously from weak association to strong bonding to classical capping, distinct regions of rapidly changing stepwise energetics often separate the different regimes. These phenomena are closely related to the properties of inorganic material surfaces (hydrophobicity and acidity/basicity), the framework architectures, and the chemical nature of adsorbate molecules. These direct thermodynamic insights reinforce our understanding of complex small molecule\u2013inorganic material interactions important to multiple disciplines of chemical engineering, materials science, nanogeoscience, and environmental technology, including heterogeneous catalysis, molecular separation, material design and synthesis, biomineralization, contaminant and nutrient transport, carbonate formation, and water\u2013organic competitions on material/mineral surfaces.", "Material Degradomics: On the Smell of Old Books_2009": "Diffusion processes superimposed upon deterministic motion play a key role in understanding and controlling the transport of matter, energy, momentum, and even information in physics, chemistry, material science, biology, and communications technology.

Here we present a method capable of simultaneously providing nonparametric estimates for both drift and diffusion profiles from evolving density profiles, requiring only the validity of Langevin/FP dynamics. This algebraic FP manipulation provides a flexible and robust framework for estimating stationary drift and diffusion coefficient profiles, is not based on fluctuation theory or solved diffusion equations, and may facilitate predictions for many experimental systems.

The basis of the synthesis is to let silica monomers polymerize in the presence of an amphiphilic template component. In the first studies, cationic surfactants were used as structure inducer. Later it was shown that pluronic copolymers also could have the role. One advantage with the pluronics copolymers is that they allow for a wider variation in the radius of pores in the resulting silica material. Another advantage lies in the higher stability resulting from the thicker walls between the pores. Mesoporous silica has a very high area to volume ratio, and the ordered structure ensures surface homogeneity. There are a number of applications of this type of material. It can be used as support for catalysts, as templates to produces other mesoporous inorganic materials, or in controlled release applications.\nThe synthesis of mesoporous silica is, from a practical point of view, simple, but there are significant possibilities to vary synthesis conditions with a concomitant effect on the properties of the resulting material. It is clear that the structural properties on the nanometer scale are determined by the self-assembly properties of the amphiphile, and this knowledge has been used to optimize pore geometry and pore size. To have a practical functional material it is desirable to also control the structure on a micrometer scale and larger. In practice, one has largely taken an empirical approach in optimizing reaction conditions, paying less attention to underlying chemical and physicochemical mechanisms that lead from starting conditions to the final product. In this Account, we present our systematic studies of the processes involved not only in the formation of the mesoporous structure as such, but also of the formation of structures on the micrometer scale. The main point is to show how the ongoing silica polymerization triggers a sequence of structural changes through the action of colloidal interactions.\nOur approach is to use a multitude of experimental methods to characterize the time evolution of the same highly reproducible synthesis process. It is the silica polymerization reactions that set the time scale, and the block copolymer self-assembly responds to the progress of the polymerization through a basically hydrophobic interaction between silica and ethylene oxide units. The progression of the silica polymerization leads to an increased hydrophobicity triggering an aggregation process resulting in the formation of silica\u2013copolymer composite particles of increasing size.

When the film is deformed by any local protrusion because of surface instability of the deposited lithium, a local piezoelectric over-potential is generated to suppress lithium deposition on the protrusion. Our optical in situ cell shows that a polarized PVDF film ensures lithium metal depositing to form a flat surface, even when starting from an uneven surface. In contrast, a nonpolarized PVDF film cannot suppress dendrite growth under the same condition, with dendrite penetrating the separator within minutes.

The method is demonstrated for a single cell in a stack and uses the theorem of equipartition of entropy production to maximize energy efficiency. The gas supply and water outlet systems, designed to produce entropy uniformly, have a fractal structure inspired by the human lung. The tree-like gas distributor engraved in the bipolar plates may eliminate the need for porous transport layers. Mathematical solutions are given for the optimal height, macroporosity, and nanoporous column width of the electro-catalytic layer beneath the gas supply system. It is shown that the optimal macroporosity of the catalytic layer is equal to 1/2 for the model chosen and that the optimal height of the catalytic layer depends upon the coefficient for first-order reaction kinetics at the cathode, the diffusion constant for oxygen in the gas phase, and the oxygen concentration of the inlet flow. An upper bound can be used for the column width.

In the decentralized approach, the entities coordinate between tiers of the system using a parametrized flow function and compete within tiers based on reaching a price equilibrium. We numerically demonstrate the increase in the total net profit of the centralized system relative to the decentralized one.

For deterministic procedures that relate nanomorphology to synthetic conditions, it is necessary to express nano- and microstructures numerically. Selecting polyurea aerogels as a model system with demonstrated potential for rich nanomorphology and guided by a statistical design-of-experiments model, we prepared a large array of materials (208) with identical chemical composition but quite different nanostructures. By reflecting on SEM imaging, it was realized that our first preverbal impression about a nanostructure is related to its openness and texture; the former is quantified by porosity (\u03a0), and the latter is oftentimes related to hydrophobicity, which, in turn, is quantified by the contact angle (\u03b8) of water droplets resting on the material. Herewith, the \u03b8-to-\u03a0 ratio is referred to as the K-index, and it was noticed that all polyurea samples of this study could be put in eight K-index groups with separate nanomorphologies ranging from caterpillar-like assemblies of nanoparticles, to thin nanofibers, to cocoon-like structures, to large bald microspheres. A first validation of the K-index as a morphology descriptor was based on compressing samples to different strains: it was observed that as the porosity decreases, the water-contact angle decreases proportionally, and thereby the K-index remains constant. The predictive power of the K-index was demonstrated with 20 polyurea aerogels prepared in 8 binary solvent systems. Subsequently, several material properties were correlated to nanomorphology through the K-index and that, in turn, provided insight about the root cause of the diversity of the nanostructure in polyurea aerogels. Finally, using response surface methodology, K-indexes and other material properties of practical interest were correlated to the monomer, water, and catalyst concentrations as well as the three Hansen solubility parameters of the sol.

Very little is known, for instance, about the evolutionary paths of molecular and nanocluster formation and its relation to laser plume hydrodynamics. This is, to a large extent; due to the complexity of numerous physical processes that coexist in a transient laser-plasma system. Here, we report the formation mechanisms of molecules during complex interactions of a laser-produced plasma plume expanding from a high purity aluminum metal target into ambient air. It is found that the plume hydrodynamics plays a great role in redefining the plasma thermodynamics and molecular formation. Early in the plasma expansion, the generated shock wave at the plume edge acts as a barrier for the combustion process and molecular formation is prevalent after the shock wave collapse. The temporally and spatially resolved contour mapping of atoms and molecules in laser ablation plumes highlight the formation routes and persistence of species in the plasma and their relation to plume hydrodynamics.", "A Semiconductor Bulk Material That Emits Direct White Light_2008": "", "GOP platform affirms importance of science_1996": "All college students in the U.S\u2014from comparative literature majors to computer science majors and everyone in between\u2014should be required to take specially designed introductory courses in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology as part of their undergraduate curriculums.

Steel recycling is expected to promote efficient resource use. However, open-loop recycling of steel could result in quality loss of nickel and molybdenum and/or material loss of chromium. Knowledge about alloying element substance flow is needed to avoid such losses. Material flow analyses (MFAs) indicate the importance of steel recycling to recovery of alloying elements. Flows of nickel, chromium, and molybdenum are interconnected, but MFAs have paid little attention to the interconnected flow of materials/substances in supply chains. This study combined a waste input\u2013output material flow model and physical unit input\u2013output analysis to perform a simultaneous MFA for nickel, chromium, and molybdenum in the Japanese economy in 2000. Results indicated the importance of recovery of these elements in recycling policies for end-of-life (EoL) vehicles and constructions. Improvement in EoL sorting technologies and implementation of designs for recycling/disassembly at the manufacturing phase are needed.

The material showed different electrochemical mechanisms in the first charge and subsequent cycles. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) study showed that the Li+ diffusion coefficients during the first charge were as small as 10\u221219 cm2 s\u22121 because of the high kinetic barriers associated with the concurrent Li+ extraction, oxygen loss, and structural rearrangement.

Bioconjugation of heparin with 6B-PDMAEMA occurred as soon as both aqueous solutions were simply mixed to form particles. The particle size at 25 \u00b0C was less than several hundred nanometers in diameter under a heparin/6B-PDMAEMA mixing weight ratio of over 2.5.

Being of relevance in biology and material science, we further investigate this issue by performing molecular dynamics simulations on a model of diblock flexible\u2013stiff polymer ring hosting a trefoil knot. We show that when both blocks are sufficiently long to accommodate the knot, by raising the temperature T, one may shift the knot position from the flexible part to the stiffer one. Even a very short flexible region has a high probability of lying within the knotted portion at lower temperatures. In addition, we observe that there is a tendency for either extremities of the knot to pin at the interface of the two blocks. This correlation between knot position and bending inhomogeneity supports the view that enzymes, binding the DNA in proximity of single-stranded gaps and nicks, have a better chance to alter the global topology of the chain.

The concept combines the strengths of individual characteristics for low ice adhesion based on elasticity, superhydrophobicity, and slippery liquid infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) for an optimal combination of high water repellency and ice-phobicity. This was achieved by replicating microtextures from a laser-irradiated aluminum substrate to an oil-infused polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer, the result of which is a flexible, superhydrophobic, and lubricated material.

Unfortunately, many of these defects arise only after electrochemical cycling which occurs under harsh conditions, making it difficult to fully comprehend the role they play in degrading material performance. Recently, it has been observed that defects are present even in the pristine material. This study, therefore, focuses on examining the nature of the disorder observed in pristine Li1.2Ni0.175Mn0.525Co0.1O2 (LNMCO) particles. Using atomic-resolution Z-contrast imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements, we show that there is indeed a significant amount of antisite defects present in this material, with transition metals substituting on Li metal sites. Furthermore, we find a strong segregation tendency of these types of defects toward open facets (surfaces perpendicular to the layered arrangement of atoms) rather than closed facets (surfaces parallel to the layered arrangement of atoms). First-principles calculations identify antisite defect pairs of Ni swapping with Li ions as the predominant defect in the material. Furthermore, energetically favorable swapping of Ni on the Mn sites was observed to lead to Mn depletion at open facets. Relatively, low Ni migration barriers also support the notion that Ni is the predominant cause of disorder. These insights suggest that certain facets of the LNMCO particles may be more useful for inhibiting surface reconstruction and improving the stability of these materials through careful consideration of the exposed surface.", "Carbon Nitride Supramolecular Hybrid Material Enabled High-Efficiency Photocatalytic Water Treatments_2016": "Dendritic polyphenylazomethines (DPA) could encapsulate ferroceniums by complexation of the electron-donating skeleton of the DPA imines.

Stepwise shifts in the isosbestic point were consistently observed with the number of imine groups in the first and second layers of the generation-4 dendrimer (DPAG4).

AWH has been recognized as a method for decentralized water production, especially in areas where liquid water is physically scarce, or the infrastructure required to bring water from other locations is unreliable or infeasible. The main methods of AWH are fog harvesting, dewing, and utilizing sorbent materials to collect vapor from the air. In this paper, we first distinguish between the geographic/climatic operating regimes of fog harvesting, dewing, and sorbent-based approaches based on temperature and relative humidity (RH). Because utilizing sorbents has the potential to be more widely applicable to areas which are also facing water scarcity, we focus our discussion on this approach. We discuss sorbent materials which have been developed for AWH and the material properties which affect system-level performance. Much of the recent materials development has focused on a single material metric, equilibrium vapor uptake in the material (kg of water uptake per kg of dry adsorbent), as found from the adsorption isotherm. This equilibrium property alone, however, is not a good indicator of the actual performance of the AWH system. Understanding material properties which affect heat and mass transport are equally important in the development of materials and components for AWH, because resistances associated with heat and mass transport in the bulk material dramatically change the system performance. We focus our discussion on modeling a solar thermal-driven system. Performance of a solar-driven AWH system can be characterized by different metrics, including L of water per m2 device per day or L of water per kg adsorbent per day. The former metric is especially important for systems driven by low-grade heat sources because the low power density of these sources makes this technology land area intensive. In either case, it is important to include rates in the performance metric to capture the effects of heat and mass transport in the system. We discuss our previously developed modeling framework which can predict the performance of a sorbent material packed into a porous matrix. This model connects mass transport across length scales, considering diffusion both inside a single crystal as well as macroscale geometric parameters, such as the thickness of a composite adsorbent layer. For a simple solar thermal-driven adsorption-based AWH system, we show how this model can be used to optimize the system.

The gas diffusion into a bubble near the peripheral edge of the hydrophobic material on the bubble surface balances that out of the bubble from the other part of the uncovered bubble surface. In the present model, gas diffusion in quiescent liquid is assumed and there is no liquid flow. The total changes of energy and entropy are both zero as it is a kind of equilibrium state. The main origin of the dynamic equilibrium state is the gradient of chemical potential of gas near the peripheral edge of the hydrophobic material. It is caused by the permanent attractive potential of a hydrophobic material to gas molecules dissolved in liquid water as there is permanent repulsion of a hydrophobic material against liquid water. Thus, the gas supply will not terminate. It is numerically shown that stable nanobubble could be present when the fraction of surface coverage by hydrophobic material is from about 0.5 to 1. The stable size of a nanobubble changes with the liquid temperature as well as the degree of gas saturation of water. In slightly degassed water, not only a nanobubble but also a microbubble could be stable in mass balance when the fraction of surface coverage for a microbubble is on the order of 10\u20134 or less.

For a given crude oil, the molecular composition of IM determines its emulsion stability and identifies those chemistries that disproportionately contribute to the interfacial layer. Here, we describe a scalable, simple, quick, and efficient procedure to isolate IM from petroleum crude oils and/or other organic matrices. Hydrated silica (\u223c26 monolayers of water on a silica surface) enables separation of interfacially active species through their interaction with the immobilized water. Species with little or no interaction with the hydrated silica (water-laden) surface are eluted with a 1:1 (vol) mixture of heptane/toluene (heptol). The interfacially active species are subsequently isolated through the addition of methanol to the eluting solvent mixture, which partially strips water from the silica surface and releases the interfacially active species. Molecular-level characterization of the two fractions (fraction 1, non-interfacially active; fraction 2, interfacially active) by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) reveals that isolated IM contains a higher abundance of acidic oxygen- and sulfur-containing compounds relative to the parent crude oil. Emulsion stability tests of the isolated fractions demonstrate that fraction 2 (interfacially active) produces a much more stable emulsion than fraction 1 (non-interfacially active).

Finally, we compare the humic material optical properties to those of authentic and laboratory generated organic carbon samples in order to assess the usefulness of these humic standards as proxies for light absorbing aerosol.", "Graphdiyne\u2013ZnO Nanohybrids as an Advanced Photocatalytic Material_2015": "", "NaV1.25Ti0.75O4: A Potential Post-Spinel Cathode Material for Mg Batteries_2017": "Columbia University and Georgia Institute of Technology are planning what could become a million-dollar center to assess the practical benefits of science and technology programs. Its tentative name is the Center for Science, Policy & Outcomes, and it will be located in Washington, D.C.\n\"We are in the earliest stages of planning this effort, and we hope to engage a broad cross-section of the R&D policy community in bringing it to fruition,\" says Michael Crow, professor of science and technology policy and vice provost at Columbia. The lead figure at Georgia Tech in the venture is Barry L. Bozeman, director of its School of Public Policy.\nCrow, who is seeking foundation funding for the venture, has sent a \"Dear Colleague\" letter to several hundred policy professionals around the country seeking ideas as to what the center should stress, and he has a few of his own.\nAs he explains in his letter, the center idea ..."}
