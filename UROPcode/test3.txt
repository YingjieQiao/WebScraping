{"Microplastics in freshwaters and drinking water: Critical review and assessment of data quality ": "Microplastics have recently been detected in drinking water as well as in drinking water sources. This presence has triggered discussions on possible implications for human health. However, there have been questions regarding the quality of these occurrence studies since there are no standard sampling, extraction and identification methods for microplastics. Accordingly, we assessed the quality of fifty studies researching microplastics in drinking water and in its major freshwater sources. This includes an assessment of microplastic occurrence data from river and lake water, groundwater, tap water and bottled drinking water. Studies of occurrence in wastewater were also reviewed. We review and propose best practices to sample, extract and detect microplastics and provide a quantitative quality assessment of studies reporting microplastic concentrations. Further, we summarize the findings related to microplastic concentrations, polymer types and particle shapes. Microplastics are frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water, and number concentrations spanned ten orders of magnitude (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122 to 108 #/m3) across individual samples and water types. However, only four out of 50 studies received positive scores for all proposed quality criteria, implying there is a significant need to improve quality assurance of microplastic sampling and analysis in water samples. The order in globally detected polymers in these studies is PE\u202f\u2248\u202fPP\u202f>\u202fPS\u202f>\u202fPVC\u202f>\u202fPET, which probably reflects the global plastic demand and a higher tendency for PVC and PET to settle as a result of their higher densities. Fragments, fibres, film, foam and pellets were the most frequently reported shapes. We conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water, to better understand potential exposure and to inform human health risk assessments.", "A review on emerging contaminants in wastewaters and the environment: Current knowledge, understudied areas and recommendations for future monitoring ": "This review identifies understudied areas of emerging contaminant (EC) research in wastewaters and the environment, and recommends direction for future monitoring. Non-regulated trace organic ECs including pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and personal care products are focused on due to ongoing policy initiatives and the expectant broadening of environmental legislation. These ECs are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, mainly derived from the discharge of municipal wastewater effluents. Their presence is of concern due to the possible ecological impact (e.g., endocrine disruption) to biota within the environment. To better understand their fate in wastewaters and in the environment, a standardised approach to sampling is needed. This ensures representative data is attained and facilitates a better understanding of spatial and temporal trends of EC occurrence. During wastewater treatment, there is a lack of suspended particulate matter analysis due to further preparation requirements and a lack of good analytical approaches. This results in the under-reporting of several ECs entering wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and the aquatic environment. Also, sludge can act as a concentrating medium for some chemicals during wastewater treatment. The majority of treated sludge is applied directly to agricultural land without analysis for ECs. As a result there is a paucity of information on the fate of ECs in soils and consequently, there has been no driver to investigate the toxicity to exposed terrestrial organisms. Therefore a more holistic approach to environmental monitoring is required, such that the fate and impact of ECs in all exposed environmental compartments are studied. The traditional analytical approach of applying targeted screening with low resolution mass spectrometry (e.g., triple quadrupoles) results in numerous chemicals such as transformation products going undetected. These can exhibit similar toxicity to the parent EC, demonstrating the necessity of using an integrated analytical approach which compliments targeted and non-targeted screening with biological assays to measure ecological impact. With respect to current toxicity testing protocols, failure to consider the enantiomeric distribution of chiral compounds found in the environment, and the possible toxicological differences between enantiomers is concerning. Such information is essential for the development of more accurate environmental risk assessment.", "Microplastics in wastewater treatment plants: Detection, occurrence and removal ": "Microplastics have aroused increasing concern as they pose threats to aquatic species as well as human beings. They do not only contribute to accumulation of plastics in the environment, but due to absorption they can also contribute to spreading of micropollutants in the environment. Studies indicated that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in releasing microplastics to the environment. Therefore, effective detection of the microplastics and understanding their occurrence and fate in WWTPs are of great importance towards microplastics control. In this review, the up-to-date status on the detection, occurrence and removal of microplastics in WWTPs are comprehensively reviewed. Specifically, the different techniques used for collecting microplastics from both wastewater and sewage sludge, and their pretreatment and characterization methods are reviewed and analyzed. The key aspects regarding microplastics occurrence in WWTPs, such as concentrations, total discharges, materials, shapes and sizes are summarized and compared. Microplastics removal in different treatment stages and their retention in sewage sludge are explored. The development of potential microplastics-targeted treatment technologies is also presented. Although previous researches in microplastics have undoubtedly improved our level of understanding, it is clear that much remains to be learned about microplastics in WWTPs, as many unanswered questions and thereby concerns still remain; some of these important future research areas are outlined. The key challenges appear to be to harmonize detection methods as well as microplastics mitigation from wastewater and sewage sludge.", "A review of bio-based materials for oil spill treatment ": "Being cost-effective, synthetic materials were initially used abundantly for the removal of oil. Gradually, however, awareness of the use of dispersants like Corexit, which makes water resources more toxic than oil, has changed the scenario for the treatment of spilled oil. The removal of spilled oil from water resources is still a very topical issue. An eco-friendly and sustainable approach towards the environment has introduced many low-cost, non-toxic and biodegradable materials along with different biomasses to make micro-to nano-sized materials, membranes, sponges/aerogel, etc. for the removal and recovery of oil from water resources. Additionally, the reusability of these materials after the recovery of oils has added one more step towards sustainability. This review comprises the work conducted by various researchers in the field of the removal and recovery of spilled oils using various biomasses and polymers, either in the form of sorbents or separators.", "Occurrence, identification and removal of microplastic particles and fibers in conventional activated sludge process and advanced MBR technology ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are acting as routes of microplastics (MPs) to the environment, hence the urgent need to examine MPs in wastewaters and different types of sludge through sampling campaigns covering extended periods of time. In this study, the efficiency of a municipal WWTP to remove MPs from wastewater was studied by collecting wastewater and sludge samples once in every two weeks during a 3-month sampling campaign. The WWTP was operated based on the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The microplastic particles and fibers from both water and sludge samples were identified by using an optical microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscope and Raman microscope. Overall, the retention capacity of microplastics in the studied WWTP was found to be 98.3%. Most of the MP fraction was removed before the activated sludge process. The efficiency of an advanced membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology was also examined. The main related finding is that MBR permeate contained 0.4\u202fMP/L in comparison with the final effluent of the CAS process (1.0\u202fMP/L). According to this study, both microplastic fibers and particles are discharged from the WWTP to the aquatic environment.", "Microplastics in freshwater systems: A review on occurrence, environmental effects, and methods for microplastics detection ": "The continuous increase in synthetic plastic production and poor management in plastic waste have led to a tremendous increase in the dumping into our aqueous environment. Consequently, microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5\u202fmm are produced and stay in both seawater and freshwater environment. The presence of microplastics as a new type of emerging contaminant has become a great issue of concerns from public and government authorities. The sources of microplastics to freshwater systems are many with the largest portion from wastewater treatment plants. The abundance of microplastics varies with the location, from above 1 million pieces per cubic meter to less than 1 piece in 100 cubic meters.\n                  Microplastics can cause several harmful physical effects on humans and living organisms through such mechanisms as entanglement and ingestion. The microplastics can act as carriers of various toxins such as additives from industrial production processes and persistent contaminants by the sorption in waters. Those toxins may cause great health problems to humans. A few studies on the fishes demonstrated that the microplastics and the associated toxins are bio-accumulated and cause such problems as intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles.\n                  In studies of microplastics, fresh water is first sampled by the nets with typical mesh size of 330\u202f\u03bcm for collection of microplastics. After the volume reducing process, the samples will then go through the purification process including density separation by such inorganic salts as sodium chloride and digestion process by oxidizing agents or enzymes. The sequence of these two processes (namely purification and digestion) is dependent on the sample type. The purified samples can be studied by several analytical methods. The commonly used methods for the qualification studies are FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and liquid chromatography. A tagging method can be used in the quantification study. Our literature study finds that there is still no universal accepted quantification and qualification tools of microplastics in fresh waters. More work is anticipated so as to obtain accurate information on microplastics in freshwater, which can then be used for the better assessment of the environmental risk.", "Identification of microplastic in effluents of waste water treatment plants using focal plane array-based micro-Fourier-transform infrared imaging ": "The global presence of microplastic (MP) in aquatic ecosystems has been shown by various studies. However, neither MP concentrations nor their sources or sinks are completely known. Waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered as significant point sources discharging MP to the environment.\n                  This study investigated MP in the effluents of 12 WWTPs in Lower Saxony, Germany. Samples were purified by a plastic-preserving enzymatic-oxidative procedure and subsequent density separation using a zinc chloride solution. For analysis, attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR) and focal plane array (FPA)-based transmission micro-FT-IR imaging were applied. This allowed the identification of polymers of all MP down to a size of 20\u00a0\u03bcm. In all effluents MP was found with quantities ranging from 0 to 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0MP\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bcm and 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101 to 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0MP\u00a0<\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bcm. By far, polyethylene was the most frequent polymer type in both size classes. Quantities of synthetic fibres ranged from 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101 to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0m\u22123 and were predominantly made of polyester. Considering the annual effluxes of tested WWTPs, total discharges of 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 to 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0MP particles and fibres per WWTP could be expected. Interestingly, one tertiary WWTP had an additionally installed post-filtration that reduced the total MP discharge by 97%. Furthermore, the sewage sludge of six WWTPs was examined and the existence of MP, predominantly polyethylene, revealed. Our findings suggest that WWTPs could be a sink but also a source of MP and thus can be considered to play an important role for environmental MP pollution.", "Evaluation of advanced oxidation processes for water and wastewater treatment \u2013 A critical review ": "This study provides an overview of established processes as well as recent progress in emerging technologies for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In addition to a discussion of major reaction mechanisms and formation of by-products, data on energy efficiency were collected in an extensive analysis of studies reported in the peer-reviewed literature enabling a critical comparison of various established and emerging AOPs based on electrical energy per order (EEO) values. Despite strong variations within reviewed EEO values, significant differences could be observed between three groups of AOPs: (1) O3 (often considered as AOP-like process), O3/H2O2, O3/UV, UV/H2O2, UV/persulfate, UV/chlorine, and electron beam represent median EEO values of <1\u202fkWh/m3, while median energy consumption by (2) photo-Fenton, plasma, and electrolytic AOPs were significantly higher (EEO values in the range of 1\u2013100 kWh/m3). (3) UV-based photocatalysis, ultrasound, and microwave-based AOPs are characterized by median values of >100\u202fkWh/m3 and were therefore considered as not (yet) energy efficient AOPs. Specific evaluation of 147 data points for the UV/H2O2 process revealed strong effects of operational conditions on reported EEO values. Besides water type and quality, a major influence was observed for process capacity (lab-vs. pilot-vs. full-scale applications) and, in case of UV-based processes, of the lamp type. However, due to the contribution of other factors, correlation of EEO values with specific water quality parameters such as UV absorbance and dissolved organic carbon were not substantial. Also, correlations between EEO and compound reactivity with OH-radicals were not significant (photolytically active compounds were not considered). Based on these findings, recommendations regarding the use of the EEO concept, including the upscaling of laboratory results, were derived.", "Solutions to microplastic pollution \u2013 Removal of microplastics from wastewater effluent with advanced wastewater treatment technologies ": "Conventional wastewater treatment with primary and secondary treatment processes efficiently remove microplastics (MPs) from the wastewater. Despite the efficient removal, final effluents can act as entrance route of MPs, given the large volumes constantly discharged into the aquatic environments. This study investigated the removal of MPs from effluent in four different municipal wastewater treatment plants utilizing different advanced final-stage treatment technologies. The study included membrane bioreactor treating primary effluent and different tertiary treatment technologies (discfilter, rapid sand filtration and dissolved air flotation) treating secondary effluent. The MBR removed 99.9% of MPs during the treatment (from 6.9 to 0.005\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121), rapid sand filter 97% (from 0.7 to 0.02\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121), dissolved air flotation 95% (from 2.0 to 0.1\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121) and discfilter 40\u201398.5% (from 0.5 \u2013 2.0 to 0.03\u20130.3\u00a0MP\u00a0L\u22121) of the MPs during the treatment. Our study shows that with advanced final-stage wastewater treatment technologies WWTPs can substantially reduce the MP pollution discharged from wastewater treatment plants into the aquatic environments.", "Microplastics in freshwater systems: A review of the emerging threats, identification of knowledge gaps and prioritisation of research needs ": "Plastic contamination is an increasing environmental problem in marine systems where it has spread globally to even the most remote habitats. Plastic pieces in smaller size scales, microplastics (particles <5\u00a0mm), have reached high densities (e.g., 100\u00a0000 items per m3) in waters and sediments, and are interacting with organisms and the environment in a variety of ways. Early investigations of freshwater systems suggest microplastic presence and interactions are equally as far reaching as are being observed in marine systems. Microplastics are being detected in freshwaters of Europe, North America, and Asia, and the first organismal studies are finding that freshwater fauna across a range of feeding guilds ingest microplastics.\n                  Drawing from the marine literature and these initial freshwater studies, we review the issue of microplastics in freshwater systems to summarise current understanding, identify knowledge gaps and suggest future research priorities. Evidence suggests that freshwater systems may share similarities to marine systems in the types of forces that transport microplastics (e.g. surface currents); the prevalence of microplastics (e.g. numerically abundant and ubiquitous); the approaches used for detection, identification and quantification (e.g. density separation, filtration, sieving and infrared spectroscopy); and the potential impacts (e.g. physical damage to organisms that ingest them, chemical transfer of toxicants). Differences between freshwater and marine systems include the closer proximity to point sources in freshwaters, the typically smaller sizes of freshwater systems, and spatial and temporal differences in the mixing/transport of particles by physical forces. These differences between marine and freshwater systems may lead to differences in the type of microplastics present. For example, rivers may show a predictable pattern in microplastic characteristics (size, shape, relative abundance) based on waste sources (e.g. household vs. industrial) adjacent to the river, and distance downstream from a point source.\n                  Given that the study of microplastics in freshwaters has only arisen in the last few years, we are still limited in our understanding of 1) their presence and distribution in the environment; 2) their transport pathways and factors that affect distributions; 3) methods for their accurate detection and quantification; 4) the extent and relevance of their impacts on aquatic life. We also do not know how microplastics might transfer from freshwater to terrestrial ecosystems, and we do not know if and how they may affect human health. This is concerning because human populations have a high dependency on freshwaters for drinking water and for food resources. Increasing the level of understanding in these areas is essential if we are to develop appropriate policy and management tools to address this emerging issue.", "Continuous ozonation of urban wastewater: Removal of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and antibiotic resistance genes and phytotoxicity ": "This work evaluated the removal of a mixture of eight antibiotics (i.e. ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLA), ofloxacin (OFL), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and tetracycline (TC)) from urban wastewater, by ozonation operated in continuous mode at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (i.e. 10, 20, 40 and 60\u202fmin) and specific ozone doses (i.e. 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 gO3 gDOC\u2212 1). As expected, the efficiency of ozonation was highly ozone dose- and contact time-dependent. The removal of the parent compounds of the selected antibiotics to levels below their detection limits was achieved with HRT of 40\u202fmin and specific ozone dose of 0.125 gO3 gDOC\u2212 1. The effect of ozonation was also investigated at a microbiological and genomic level, by studying the efficiency of the process with respect to the inactivation of Escherichia coli and antibiotic-resistant E.\u00a0coli, as well as to the reduction of the abundance of selected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The inactivation of total cultivable E.\u00a0coli was achieved under the experimental conditions of HRT 40\u202fmin and 0.25 gO3 gDOC\u22121, at which all antibiotic compounds were already degraded. The regrowth examinations revealed that higher ozone concentrations were required for the permanent inactivation of E.\u00a0coli below the Limit of Quantification (<LOQ\u202f=\u202f0.01\u202fCFU mL\u2212 1). Also, the abundance of the examined ARGs (intl1, aadA1, dfrA1, qacE\u03941 and sul1) was found to decrease with increasing HRT and ozone dose. Despite the fact that the mildest operating parameters were able to eliminate the parent compounds of the tested antibiotics in wastewater effluents, it was clearly demonstrated in this study that higher ozone doses were required in order to confer permanent damage and/or death and prevent potential post-treatment re-growth of both total bacteria and ARB, and to reduce the abundance of ARGs below the LOQ. Interestingly, the mineralization of wastewater, in terms of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) removal, was found to be significantly low even when the higher ozone doses were applied, leading to an increased phytotoxicity towards various plant species. The findings of this study clearly underline the importance of properly optimising the ozonation process (e.g. specific ozone dose and contact time) taking into consideration both the bacterial species and associated ARGs, as well as the wastewater physicochemical properties (e.g. DOC), in order to mitigate the spread of ARB&ARGs, as well as to reduce the potential phytotoxicity.", "Antibiotic resistance genes in treated wastewater and in the receiving water bodies: A pan-European survey of urban settings ": "There is increasing public concern regarding the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during wastewater treatment, their persistence during the treatment process and their potential impacts on the receiving water bodies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine the abundance of nine ARGs and a class 1 integron associated integrase gene in 16 wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents from ten different European countries. In order to assess the impact on the receiving water bodies, gene abundances in the latter were also analysed.\n                  Six out of the nine ARGs analysed were detected in all effluent and river water samples. Among the quantified genes, intI1 and sul1 were the most abundant. Our results demonstrate that European WWTP contribute to the enrichment of the resistome in the receiving water bodies with the particular impact being dependent on the effluent load and local hydrological conditions. The ARGs concentrations in WWTP effluents were found to be inversely correlated to the number of implemented biological treatment steps, indicating a possible option for WWTP management.\n                  Furthermore, this study has identified bla\n                     OXA-58 as a possible resistance gene for future studies investigating the impact of WWTPs on their receiving water.", "Nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment processes \u2013 Origin, impact and potential solutions ": "The presence of nano and microplastics in water has increasingly become a major environmental challenge. A key challenge in their detection resides in the relatively inadequate analytical techniques available preventing deep understanding of the fate of nano/microplastics in water. The occurrence of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment plants poses a concern for the quality of the treated water. Due to their broad but small size and diverse chemical natures, nano/microplastics may travel easily along water and wastewater treatment processes infiltrating remediation processes at various levels, representing operational and process stability challenges. This review aims at presenting the current understanding of the fate and impact of nano/microplastics through water and wastewater treatment plants. The formation and fragmentation mechanisms, physical-chemical properties and occurrence of nano/microplastics in water are correlated to the interactions of nano/microplastics with water and wastewater treatment plant processes and potential solutions to limit these interactions are comprehensively reviewed. This critical analysis offers new strategies to limit the number of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater to keep water quality up to the required standards and reduce threats on our ecosystems.", "Determinants of presence and removal of antibiotic resistance genes during WWTP treatment: A cross-sectional study ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), linking human fecal residues and the environment, are considered as hotspots for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In order to evaluate the role of WWTPs and underlying operational parameters for the removal of AMR, the presence and removal efficiency of a selected set of 6 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and 2 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) was evaluated by means of qPCR in influent and effluent samples from 62 Dutch WWTPs. The role of possible factors impacting the concentrations of ARGs and MGEs in the influent and their removal was identified through statistical analysis. ARGs and the class I integron-integrase gene (intI1) were, on average, removed to a similar extent (1.76 log reduction) or better (+0.30\u20131.90 logs) than the total bacteria (measured as 16S rRNA gene). In contrast, broad-host-range plasmids (IncP-1) had a significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) relative abundance after treatment. The presence of healthcare institutions in the area served did only slightly increase the concentrations of ARGs or MGEs in influent. From the extended panel of operational parameters, rainfall, increasing the hydraulic load of the plant, most significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) affected the treatment efficiency by decreasing it on average\u00a0\u22120.38 logs per time the flow exceeded the average daily flow. Our results suggest that overall, WWTP treatments do not favor the proliferation of the assessed resistance genes but might increase the relative abundance of broad-host-range plasmids of the IncP-1 type.", "Full-scale partial nitritation/anammox experiences \u2013 An application survey ": "Partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) has been one of the most innovative developments in biological wastewater treatment in recent years. With its discovery in the 1990s a completely new way of ammonium removal from wastewater became available. Over the past decade many technologies have been developed and studied for their applicability to the PN/A concept and several have made it into full-scale. With the perspective of reaching 100 full-scale installations in operation worldwide by 2014 this work presents a summary of PN/A technologies that have been successfully developed, implemented and optimized for high-strength ammonium wastewaters with low C:N ratios and elevated temperatures. The data revealed that more than 50% of all PN/A installations are sequencing batch reactors, 88% of all plants being operated as single-stage systems, and 75% for sidestream treatment of municipal wastewater. Additionally an in-depth survey of 14 full-scale installations was conducted to evaluate practical experiences and report on operational control and troubleshooting. Incoming solids, aeration control and nitrate built up were revealed as the main operational difficulties. The information provided gives a unique/new perspective throughout all the major technologies and discusses the remaining obstacles.", "Spatial ecology of a wastewater network defines the antibiotic resistance genes in downstream receiving waters ": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an effective barrier in the protection of human and environment health around the world, although WWTPs also are suggested to be selectors and-or reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) before entering the environment. The dogma about WWTPs as \u201cARG selectors\u201d presumes that biotreatment compartments (e.g., activated sludge; AS) are single densely populated ecosystems with elevated horizontal gene transfer. However, recent work has suggested WWTP biotreatment compartments may be different than previously believed relative to antibiotic resistance (AR) fate, and other process factors, such as bacterial separation and specific waste sources, may be key to ARGs released to the environment. Here we combined 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing and high-throughput qPCR to characterise microbial communities and ARGs across a wastewater network in Spain that includes both community (i.e., non-clinical urban) and hospital sources. Contrary to expectations, ARGs found in downstream receiving waters were not dominated by AS biosolids (RAS), but more resembled raw wastewater sources. In fact, ARGs and microbial communities in liquid-phase WWTP effluents and RAS were significantly different (Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index\u202f=\u202f0.66\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.11), with a consequential fraction of influent ARGs and organisms passing directly through the WWTP with limited association with RAS. Instead, ARGs and organisms in the RAS may be more defined by biosolids separation and biophysical traits, such as flocculation, rather than ARG carriage. This explains why RAS has significantly lower ARG richness (47\u202f\u00b1\u202f4 ARGs) than liquid-phase effluents (104\u202f\u00b1\u202f5 ARGs), and downstream water column (135\u202f\u00b1\u202f4 ARGs) and river sediments (120\u202f\u00b1\u202f5 ARGs) (Tukey's test, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). These data suggest RAS and liquid-phase WWTP effluents may reflect two parallel ecosystems with potentially limited ARG exchange. As such, ARG mitigation in WWTPs should more focus on removing bacterial hosts from the liquid phase, AR source reduction, and possibly disinfection to reduce ARG releases to the environment.", "Lead release to potable water during the Flint, Michigan water crisis as revealed by routine biosolids monitoring data ": "Routine biosolids monitoring data provides an independent and comprehensive means to estimate water lead release pre-, during and post-Flint Water Crisis (FWC). The mass of potable plumbing-related metals (i.e., lead, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc) in sewage biosolids strongly correlated with one another during the FWC (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). A simple parametric regression model based on 90th percentile potable water lead measurements (WLL90) from five city-wide citizen science sampling efforts August 2015\u2013August 2017 was strongly correlated to corresponding monthly lead mass in biosolids [Biosolids-Pb (kg)\u00a0=\u00a00.483 x WLL90 (\u03bcg/L)\u00a0+\u00a01.79; R2\u202f=\u202f0.86, p\u202f<\u202f0.05]. Although total biosolids lead increased just 14% during the 18 months of the FWC versus the comparable time pre-FWC, 76% of that increase occurred in July\u2013September 2014, and the corresponding percentage of Flint children under 6 years with elevated blood lead \u2265 5\u202f\u03bcg/dL (i.e., %EBL5) doubling from 3.45% to 6.61% in those same three months versus 2013 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). %EBL5 was not statistically higher during the remaining months of the FWC compared to pre-FWC or post-FWC. As expected, lead in biosolids during the FWC, when orthophosphate was not added, was moderately correlated with water temperature (R2\u202f=\u202f0.30, p\u202f<\u202f0.05), but not at other times pre- and post-FWC when orthophosphate was present. Tripling the orthophosphate dose post-FWC versus pre-FWC and some lead pipe removal, decreased lead in biosolids (and %EBL5) to historic lows (2016\u20132017 vs. 2012\u20132013; p\u202f<\u202f0.05), supporting the effectiveness of these public health interventions in reducing childhood water lead exposure.", "Diversity and antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli populations in hospital and community wastewater compared to wastewater at the receiving urban treatment plant ": "Bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns among the indicator organism Escherichia coli were monitored in wastewater samples collected over one year from a hospital (HW), a community (CW) and the receiving urban (UW) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We compared levels of antibiotic resistance in the different types of wastewater, and identified whether resistant strains were endemic in the wastewater system. If so, implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots (e.g. hospital outlets) could be used to decrease the amount of resistant bacteria in the wastewater. E.\u00a0coli from HW (n\u202f=\u202f2644), CW (n\u202f=\u202f2525) and UW (n\u202f=\u202f2693) were analyzed by biochemical phenotyping (PhenePlate System) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics (AREB System). The phenotypic diversities of the total E.\u00a0coli populations were similar for all three sites (Simpson's Diversity index, Di\u202f=\u202f0.973), however for individual samples, HW showed low diversities (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.800) and the E.\u00a0coli flora was often dominated by strains that may have originated from the fecal flora of single individuals. The diversities in CW samples was higher (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.936), and UW samples showed similar diversities as the whole collection of isolates (Median Di\u202f=\u202f0.971). Resistance to at least one of the nine antibiotics was observed in 45% of the HW isolates, 44% of CW isolates, and 33% of UW isolates. Resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol was uncommon (3.2 and 5.3%, respectively), whereas resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was most common (24% and 31%, respectively). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E.\u00a0coli (ESBL-EC) were more common in HW (11.5%) and in CW (6.9%) compared to UW (3.7%). A high diversity (Di\u202f=\u202f0.974) was observed among ESBL-EC isolates from UW (n\u202f=\u202f99), indicating absence of any clonal structure among these isolates. Common PhP types of ESBL-EC often dominated in each HW sample, but were not identified across different samples, whereas ESBL-EC in CW showed low diversity (Di\u202f=\u202f0.857) and were dominated by a specific PhP type that was found across almost all CW samples. The antibiotic resistance rates were highest in hospital wastewater, but surprisingly they were also high in the studied community wastewater, compared to the urban wastewater. The relative contribution of HW seemed low in terms of dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria to the WWTP.", "Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill: A source of microplastics? -Evidence of microplastics in landfill leachate ": "Although landfill is suspected to be releasing microplastics to the environment, there is few empirical researches carried out. To clarify suspicions of landfills as potential sources of microplastics, twelve leachate samples from four active and two closed municipal solid waste landfills were investigated. Microplastics were found in all the landfill leachate samples. In total, seventeen different types of plastics were identified in the leachate samples with calculated concentration ranging from 0.42 to 24.58 items/L. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the predominant polymer types. 99.36% microplastics were derived from the fragmentation of plastic waste buried in landfills. The size of 77.48% microplastics was between 100 and 1000\u202f\u03bcm. The study shows that the generation, accumulation and release of microplastic in landfills is a long-term process. The results of our study provide preliminary evidence and validate that landfill isn't the final sink of plastics, but a potential source of microplastics.", "Analysis of microplastics in water by micro-Raman spectroscopy: Release of plastic particles from different packaging into mineral water ": "Microplastics are anthropogenic contaminants which have been found in oceans, lakes and rivers. Investigations focusing on drinking water are rare and studies have mainly been using micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (\u03bc-FT-IR). A major limitation of this technique is its inability to detect particles smaller than 20\u00a0\u03bcm. However, micro-Raman spectroscopy is capable of detecting even smaller particle sizes. Therefore, we show that this technique, which was used in this study, is particularly useful in detecting microplastics in drinking water where particle sizes are in the low micrometer range. In our study, we compared the results from drinking water distributed in plastic bottles, glass bottles and beverage cartons.\n                  We tested the microplastic content of water from 22 different returnable and single-use plastic bottles, 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles obtained from grocery stores in Germany. Small (\u201350-500\u00a0\u03bcm) and very small (1\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm) microplastic fragments were found in every type of water. Interestingly, almost 80% of all microplastic particles found had a particle size between 5 and 20\u00a0\u03bcm and were therefore not detectable by the analytical techniques used in previous studies. The average microplastics content was 118\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088 particles/l in returnable, but only 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 particles/l in single-use plastic bottles. The microplastics content in the beverage cartons was only 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 particles/l. Contrary to our assumptions we found high amounts of plastic particles in some of the glass bottled waters (range 0\u2013253 particles/l, mean 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a052 particles/l). A statistically significant difference from the blank value (14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013) to the investigated packaging types could only be shown comparing to the returnable bottles (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\n                  Most of the particles in water from returnable plastic bottles were identified as consisting of polyester (primary polyethylene terephthalate PET, 84%) and polypropylene (PP; 7%). This is not surprising since the bottles are made of PET and the caps are made of PP. In water from single-use plastic bottles only a few micro-PET-particles have been found. In the water from beverage cartons and also from glass bottles, microplastic particles other than PET were found, for example polyethylene or polyolefins. This can be explained by the fact that beverage cartons are coated with polyethylene foils and caps are treated with lubricants. Therefore, these findings indicate that the packaging itself may release microparticles. The main fraction of the microplastic particles identified are of very small size with dimensions less than 20\u00a0\u03bcm, which is not detectable with the \u03bc-FT-IR technique used in previous studies.", "Transport and fate of microplastic particles in wastewater treatment plants ": "Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are frequently suspected as significant point sources or conduits of microplastics to the environment. To directly investigate these suspicions, effluent discharges from seven tertiary plants and one secondary plant in Southern California were studied. The study also looked at influent loads, particle size/type, conveyance, and removal at these wastewater treatment facilities. Over 0.189 million liters of effluent at each of the seven tertiary plants were filtered using an assembled stack of sieves with mesh sizes between 400 and 45\u00a0\u03bcm. Additionally, the surface of 28.4 million liters of final effluent at three tertiary plants was skimmed using a 125\u00a0\u03bcm filtering assembly. The results suggest that tertiary effluent is not a significant source of microplastics and that these plastic pollutants are effectively removed during the skimming and settling treatment processes. However, at a downstream secondary plant, an average of one micro-particle in every 1.14 thousand liters of final effluent was counted. The majority of microplastics identified in this study had a profile (color, shape, and size) similar to the blue polyethylene particles present in toothpaste formulations. Existing treatment processes were determined to be very effective for removal of microplastic contaminants entering typical municipal WWTPs.", "Applications of nanotechnology in water and wastewater treatment ": "Providing clean and affordable water to meet human needs is a grand challenge of the 21st century. Worldwide, water supply struggles to keep up with the fast growing demand, which is exacerbated by population growth, global climate change, and water quality deterioration. The need for technological innovation to enable integrated water management cannot be overstated. Nanotechnology holds great potential in advancing water and wastewater treatment to improve treatment efficiency as well as to augment water supply through safe use of unconventional water sources. Here we review recent development in nanotechnology for water and wastewater treatment. The discussion covers candidate nanomaterials, properties and mechanisms that enable the applications, advantages and limitations as compared to existing processes, and barriers and research needs for commercialization. By tracing these technological advances to the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials, the present review outlines the opportunities and limitations to further capitalize on these unique properties for sustainable water management.", "Full-scale comparison of UV/H2O2 and UV/Cl2 advanced oxidation: The degradation of micropollutant surrogates and the formation of disinfection byproducts ": "The photolysis of chlorine by UV light leads to the formation of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) as well as reactive chlorine species (RCS) that can be effective as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water treatment. Much of the research to date has been done at laboratory- or bench-scale. This study reports results from a model that demonstrates that the relative effectiveness of the UV/Cl2 AOP compared to the more traditional UV/H2O2 AOP is a function of optical path length. As such, the relative effectiveness of the two treatment options evaluated at small scale may not reflect the relative performance at full-scale, making results previously obtained at small-scale potentially less scalable. This study therefore compares the performance of UV/Cl2 to UV/H2O2 at a full-scale water treatment plant, using sucralose and caffeine as spiked surrogates for contaminants that are reactive solely to OH radicals, and to both OH and RCS, respectively. pH was varied between 6.5 and 8.0. The results demonstrated that when using a medium pressure UV lamp, UV/Cl2 might lead to approximately twice the production of OH radicals as UV/H2O2 at pH 6.5 when using the same molar oxidant concentration, but adding chlorine to the UV reactor at pH 8.0 had a negligible impact on OH radical concentration in comparison to UV alone. The study also confirmed previous small-scale results that RCS can be a major contributor to UV/Cl2 treatment for compounds such as caffeine that are susceptible to RCS, with UV/Cl2 effective at both pH 6.5 and 8.0 for such compounds. Disinfection byproducts were monitored, with adsorbable organohalide (AOX) formation increasing by approximately 10\u202f\u03bcg-Cl/L due to chlorine photolysis, but only at pH 6.5 and not at pH 8.0. This implies that UV/Cl2 might increase AOX mostly due to reaction between OH and organic precursors to make them more reactive with chlorine, and not due to RCS. The formation of specific DBPs of current or emerging regulatory interest was minimal under all conditions, except for chlorate. Chlorate yields were in the order of 6\u201318% of the photolysed chlorine.", "Export of microplastics from land to sea. A modelling approach ": "Quantifying the transport of plastic debris from river to sea is crucial for assessing the risks of plastic debris to human health and the environment. We present a global modelling approach to analyse the composition and quantity of point-source microplastic fluxes from European rivers to the sea. The model accounts for different types and sources of microplastics entering river systems via point sources. We combine information on these sources with information on sewage management and plastic retention during river transport for the largest European rivers. Sources of microplastics include personal care products, laundry, household dust and tyre and road wear particles (TRWP). Most of the modelled microplastics exported by rivers to seas are synthetic polymers from TRWP (42%) and plastic-based textiles abraded during laundry (29%). Smaller sources are synthetic polymers and plastic fibres in household dust (19%) and microbeads in personal care products (10%). Microplastic export differs largely among European rivers, as a result of differences in socio-economic development and technological status of sewage treatment facilities. About two-thirds of the microplastics modelled in this study flow into the Mediterranean and Black Sea. This can be explained by the relatively low microplastic removal efficiency of sewage treatment plants in the river basins draining into these two seas. Sewage treatment is generally more efficient in river basins draining into the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. We use our model to explore future trends up to the year 2050. Our scenarios indicate that in the future river export of microplastics may increase in some river basins, but decrease in others. Remarkably, for many basins we calculate a reduction in river export of microplastics from point-sources, mainly due to an anticipated improvement in sewage treatment.", "Persistent contaminants as potential constraints on the recovery of urban river food webs from gross pollution ": "Urban areas contribute substantially to xenobiotic contaminant loads in rivers, but their effects have been investigated more for individual organisms and sensitive taxa, rather than through the emergent properties of communities. Here, we use replicated, catchment-scale sampling of benthic invertebrates and novel multivariate techniques to assess whether urban wastewater contaminants affected the structure and function of river food webs. We postulated that the continued occurrence of selected contaminants in river systems might explain the incomplete recovery of urban rivers from legacy gross pollution. Benthic invertebrate communities were sampled monthly over a year (2016\u20132017) at 18 sites across 3 river systems in South Wales (United Kingdom). Contaminant sources were characterised using remote sensing, water quality data from routine monitoring and measured concentrations of selected persistent xenobiotic pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers). Urban wastewater discharges had relatively limited effects on river water quality, with small increases in nitrate, phosphate, temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solids in urban systems. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in invertebrates, however, were significantly higher under greater urban land cover and wastewater discharge. Food webs at the most highly contaminated urban sites were characterised by: (i) reduced taxonomic and functional diversity; (ii) simplified food web structure with reduced network connectance; and (iii) reductions in the abundance of prey important for apex predators such as the Eurasian dipper (Cinclus cinclus). Although correlative and partially confounded by other effects, these data provide support for the hypothesis that impairment to food webs resulting from urban pollutants might explain population, community and ecosystem-level effects in urban river systems, and hence incomplete recovery from past pollution.", "Current time-temperature relationships for thermal inactivation of Ascaris eggs at mesophilic temperatures are too conservative and may hamper development of simple, but effective sanitation ": "Ascaris eggs are commonly used as indicators for pathogen inactivation during the treatment of fecal sludge and wastewater due to their highly resistant lipid membrane and ability to survive in the environment for long periods of time. Current guidelines suggest that thermal treatment alone cannot inactivate Ascaris eggs at temperatures below 45\u202f\u00b0C, although some evidence in the literature suggests this to be incorrect. Here, we performed a controlled experiment to test the effect of mesophilic temperatures on Ascaris inactivation. We exposed Ascaris suum eggs to a temperature gradient between 34\u00b0C and 45\u202f\u00b0C under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to observe the required exposure times for a 3-log reduction. Indeed, we found that temperatures lower than 45\u202f\u00b0C did inactivate these eggs, and the required exposure times were up to two orders of magnitude shorter than suggested by current guidelines. Results from the anaerobic exposures were used to develop a time-temperature relationship that is appropriate for Ascaris inactivation at mesophilic temperatures. Data from the literature demonstrated that our relationship is conservative, with faster inactivation occurring under environmental conditions when Ascaris eggs were suspended in fecal sludge or manure. A specific aerobic relationship was not developed, but we demonstrated that aerobic conditions cause faster inactivation than anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the anaerobic relationship provides a conservative guideline for both conditions. We demonstrate that relatively low temperatures can considerably impact Ascaris viability and suggest that mesophilic temperatures can be used in waste treatment processes to inactivate pathogens. The development of safe, low-input, mesophilic treatment processes is particularly valuable for ensuring universal access to safe sanitation and excreta management.", "Development and validation of a physiologically based kinetic model for starting up and operation of the biological gas desulfurization process under haloalkaline conditions ": "Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic and corrosive gas that must be removed from gaseous hydrocarbon streams prior to combustion. This paper describes a gas biodesulfurization process where sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) facilitate sulfide conversion to both sulfur and sulfate. In order to optimize the formation of sulfur, it is crucial to understand the relations between the SOB microbial composition, kinetics of biological and abiotic sulfide oxidation and the effects on the biodesulfurization process efficiency. Hence, a physiologically based kinetic model was developed for four different inocula. The resulting model can be used as a tool to evaluate biodesulfurization process performance. The model relies on a ratio of two key enzymes involved in the sulfide oxidation process, i.e., flavocytochrome c and sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase (FCC and SQR). The model was calibrated by measuring biological sulfide oxidation rates for different inocula obtained from four full-scale biodesulfurization installations fed with gases from various industries. Experimentally obtained biological sulfide oxidation rates showed dissimilarities between the tested biomasses which could be explained by assuming distinctions in the key-enzyme ratios. Hence, we introduce a new model parameter \u03b1 to whereby \u03b1 describes the ratio between the relative expression levels of FCC and SQR enzymes. Our experiments show that sulfur production is the highest at low \u03b1 values.", "Towards high resolution monitoring of water flow velocity using flat flexible thin mm-sized resistance-typed sensor film (MRSF) ": "Novel flexible thin mm-sized resistance-typed sensor film (MRSF) fabricated using ink-jet printing technology (IPT) was developed in this study to monitor water flow rate in pipelines in real time in situ mode. The mechanism of MRSF is that the mm-sized interdigitated electrodes made by printing silver nanoparticles on an elastic polyimide film bend under different flow rates, leading to variation of the resistance of the sensor at different degrees of curvature. Continuous flow tests showed that MRSF possessed a high accuracy (0.2\u202fm/s) and excellent sensitivity (0.1447/ms\u22121). A model of sensor resistance and flow velocity was established to unfold the correlation between the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and the mechanic flexibility of sensor materials. An analytical model yielded a high coefficient of determination (R2\u202f>\u202f0.93) for the relationship between the resistance increment of the MRSF and the square of the flow velocity at the velocity range of 0.25\u20132\u202fm/s. Furthermore, a temperature-correction model was developed to quantify the effect of water temperature on the sensor resistance readings. MRSF exhibited a low temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR, 0.001) at the water temperature range of 20\u201360\u202f\u00b0C. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the finite element method were conducted and confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions. High-resolution monitoring of water flow rate using MRSF technology was expected to save at least 50% energy consumption for a given unit, especially under flow fluctuation. MRSF possesses a great potential to perform real-time in situ monitoring at high accuracy with ultralow cost, thus enabling the feedback control at high spatiotemporal resolution to reduce the overall energy consumption in water and wastewater systems.", "Improving water-efficient irrigation: Prospects and difficulties of innovative practices ": "Innovative irrigation practices can enhance water efficiency, gaining an economic advantage while also reducing environmental burdens. In some cases the necessary knowledge has been provided by extension services, helping farmers to adapt and implement viable solutions, thus gaining more benefits from irrigation technology. Often investment in technological improvements has incurred higher water prices, however, without gaining the full potential benefits through water efficiency. Farmers generally lack adequate means and incentives to know crops\u2019 water use, actual irrigation applications, crops\u2019 yield response to different water management practices, and thus current on-farm water-efficiency levels.\n                  Those general difficulties are illustrated by our two case studies investigating options, stimuli and difficulties to improve water-efficient practices. The two areas have strong stimuli for improvement but lack a knowledge-exchange system to help farmers and resource managers identify scope for improvements. Partly for this reason, farmers\u2019 responsibility for efficient water management has been displaced to hypothetical prospects, e.g. extra supplies from reuse of treated wastewater or a long-term low water pricing. In both cases a displaced responsibility complements the default assumption that farmers\u2019 irrigation practices already have adequate water-use efficiency. Under current circumstances, agricultural water management will maintain the unknown water-efficiency level and farmers will have weaker incentives to make efforts for more efficient practices. A continuous knowledge-exchange is necessary so that all relevant stakeholders can share greater responsibility across the entire water-supply chain. On this basis, more water-efficient management could combine wider environmental benefits with economic advantage for farmers.", "Adaptation strategies for agricultural water management under climate change in Europe ": "Climate change is expected to intensify the existing risks, particularly in regions where water scarcity is already a concern, as well as create new opportunities in some areas. Efforts to develop adaptation strategies for agricultural water management can benefit from understanding the risks and adaptation strategies proposed to date. This understanding may assist in developing priorities for the adaptation of water resources for irrigation. Here we characterise the main risks across European regions and evaluate adaptation strategies by reviewing over 168 highly relevant publications that appeared in the last 15 years. Based on this extensive database we characterise the effort and benefit of a number of agronomic and policy measures, aiming to develop concrete adaptation plans and responding to concrete regional challenges. The adaptation choices consider current technological perspectives and do not project future technological change; we are certain that technological change will shape some choices for adaptation in the coming decades. The greatest scope for action is in improving adaptive capacity and responding to changes in water demands, however the implementation requires revamping current water policy, adequate training to farmers and viable financial instruments. These results aim to assist stakeholders as they take up the adaptation challenge and develop measures to reduce the vulnerability of the sector to climate change.", "Agro-industrial wastewater reuse for irrigation of a vegetable crop succession under Mediterranean conditions ": "In many countries of the Mediterranean region, characterized by frequent drought periods, agricultural production often occurs under water deficiency or conditions that cause the depletion of the existing water resources. In these areas, the reuse of reclaimed wastewater for crop irrigation could contribute to mitigate/decrease water shortage, support the agriculture sector and protect groundwater resources. In 1.5-year field experiments in Southern Italy (Apulia Region), the effects of irrigation with treated agro-industrial wastewater on soil properties, crops yield and qualitative traits of crop products, including their microbiological safety, were assessed. Groundwater (GW), secondary treated wastewater (SW) and tertiary treated wastewater (TW) from an innovative \u201con-demand\u201d UV disinfection system were used to irrigate tomato and broccoli, cultivated in succession. The three irrigation water sources and the corresponding irrigated soils, plants and crop products were analyzed for the main physico-chemical characteristics, quali-quantitative parameters and fecal indicators. SW and TW showed higher values of the main physico-chemical parameters than GW. SW irrigated soil resulted in a significant increase of NH4-N, Na+, SAR, EC (below the threshold value beyond which a soil is defined as saline) during the first tomato crop cycle, and of pH during the broccoli growing season. Irrigation with treated wastewater did not significantly affect the marketable yield nor the qualitative traits of tomato and broccoli crops, except for the Na+ and NO3\n                     \u2212 content (below the threshold levels defined by the European guidelines for vegetables). High levels of E. coli (above the Italian limit for reuse), Fecal coliforms and Fecal enterococci (up to 104 CFU 100ml\u22121) were observed in the SW and, when chlorination was not done, in the TW. Nevertheless, E. coli was not isolated from any sample of soil, plant and crop product, probably due to its rapid die-off. Moreover, low concentrations of Fecal coliforms and Total heterotrophic count were found in plant and crop product. The drip irrigation system used, which avoided the close contact between water and plant, may have contributed to this. Under the conditions applied in this study, the reuse of treated agro-industrial wastewater for irrigation can be considered an effective way to cope with agricultural water shortage in the Mediterranean area.", "AquaCrop-OS: An open source version of FAO's crop water productivity model ": "Crop simulation models are valuable tools for quantifying crop yield response to water, and for devising strategies to improve agricultural water management. However, applicability of the majority of crop models is limited greatly by a failure to provide open-access to model source code. In this study, we present an open-source version of the FAO AquaCrop model, which simulates efficiently water-limited crop production across diverse environmental and agronomic conditions. Our model, called AquaCrop-OpenSource (AquaCrop-OS), can be run in multiple programming languages and operating systems. Support for parallel execution reduces significantly simulation times when applying the model in large geospatial frameworks, for long-run policy analysis, or for uncertainty assessment. Furthermore, AquaCrop-OS is compliant with the Open Modelling Interface standard facilitating linkage to other disciplinary models, for example to guide integrated water resources planning.", "Long-term sustainability of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in question: An economic assessment of water management alternatives ": "A dense dike system has been built in the upstream floodplains of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, allowing large scale rice production based on compartmentalized fields and optimized water management. Intensive cultivation has enabled farmers to greatly increase their rice productivity and augment the national food bowl. However, flood-control structures have undermined the water retention capacity, compromising various benefits of floodwaters for delta ecosystems. Effects are both internal and external to farming. Negative internal effects are the large investment requirements and higher farming costs. Negative externalities include increased flood damage, reduced sediment flows, saltwater intrusion and riverbank erosion. In this study, we assessed the effects of three dike\u2013agricultural system scenarios on delta-level sustainability, considering both internal and external effects. Direct and indirect costs were estimated using various methodologies and the literature. Our findings show that extensive development of high dikes on the floodplains is the least economical and most ecologically risky alternative. In this scenario, accelerated high-dike construction exacted a cost 136% greater than the situation represented by the baseline year of 2011. Externalities in this scenario contributed to rising economic losses in both aquaculture and agriculture. The scenario of transforming high-dike into low-dike systems revealed lower water management costs combined with lesser environmental impacts and greater capacity to exploit floodwater benefits. Our findings provide a useful input for decision-makers considering the unintended economic consequences of existing water management strategies. They support a transition to low-dike farming systems for a more sustainable delta.", "Water scarcity: Fact or fiction? ": "It is surprisingly difficult to determine whether water is truly scarce in the physical sense at a global scale (a supply problem) or whether it is available but should be used better (a demand problem). The paper reviews water scarcity indicators and global assessments based on these indicators. The most widely used indicator, the Falkenmark indicator, is popular because it is easy to apply and understand but it does not help to explain the true nature of water scarcity. The more complex indicators are not widely applied because data are lacking to apply them and the definitions are not intuitive. Water is definitely physically scarce in densely populated arid areas, Central and West Asia, and North Africa, with projected availabilities of less than 1000m3/capita/year. This scarcity relates to water for food production, however, and not to water for domestic purposes that are minute at this scale. In most of the rest of the world water scarcity at a national scale has as much to do with the development of the demand as the availability of the supply. Accounting for water for environmental requirements shows that abstraction of water for domestic, food and industrial uses already have a major impact on ecosystems in many parts of the world, even those not considered \u201cwater scarce\u201d. Water will be a major constraint for agriculture in coming decades and particularly in Asia and Africa this will require major institutional adjustments. A \u201csoft path\u201d to address water scarcity, focusing on increasing overall water productivity, is recommended.", "Model of crop growth, water flow, and solute transport in layered soil ": "Agro-eco-hydrological models are essential for managing scarce water resources and ensuring crop productivity. Here, a one-dimensional agro-eco-hydrological model, LAWSTAC, capable of simulating water and solute transport in layered soil coupled with crop growth, is presented and validated. LAWSTAC considers eight hydraulic conductivity discretization methods to address the nonlinearity of Richards equation for soil water flow. LAWSTAC includes two root water uptake models and a flexible root distribution model for reliable transpiration simulation. Simulation of infiltration in layered soil demonstrated that the methods of arithmetic mean, geometric mean and triadic mean performed well among the eight discretization methods. The model was further verified by comparison with results from two widely used models, HYDRUS-1D and SWAP, based on the measured data in a spring wheat field for 2007 and 2008 in the Northwest China. The models produced similar results for flow in layered soil, although SWAP showed some instability in the salinity dynamics. LAWSTAC models crop growth with a more efficient parameterization than SWAP. The root mean square error for soil moisture, soil salinity concentration and LAI simulated by LAWSTAC was less than 0.06\u2009cm3\u2009cm\u22123, 3.56\u2009g L-1, and 0.43, respectively. In conclusion, LAWSTAC is suitable for simulating soil water and salinity dynamics, crop growth and their interactions.", "Assessing the environmental sustainability of irrigation with oil and gas produced water in drylands ": "Produced water (PW) is the largest by-product of the oil and gas industry. Its management is both economically and environmentally costly. PW reuse for irrigation offers an alternative to current disposal practices while providing water to irrigators in drylands. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the environmental effects of irrigation with PW. The SALTIRSOIL_M model was used to simulate the irrigation of sugar beet with 15 PWs of a wide range of qualities in four climates of different aridity and on four contrasting soil types. The impacts on soil salinity, sodicity and pH as well as on crop yield and drainage water salinity were estimated. Well-drained soils with low water content at field capacity (Arenosol) are less sensitive to salinisation while a relatively high gypsum content (Gypsisol) makes the soil less vulnerable to both sodification and salinisation. On the contrary, clayey soils with higher water content at field capacity and lower gypsum content must be avoided as the soil structural stability as well as a tolerable soil electrical conductivity for the crop cannot be maintained on the long-term. Soil pH was not found to be sensitive to PW quality. Drainage water quality was found to be closely linked to PW quality although it is also influenced by the soil type. The impact of drainage water on the aquifer must be considered and reuse or disposal implemented accordingly for achieving sustainable irrigation. Finally, increasing aridity intensifies soil and drainage water salinity and sodicity. This investigation highlights the importance of adapting the existing irrigation water quality guidelines through the use of models to include relevant parameters related to soil type and aridity. Indeed, it will support the petroleum industry and irrigators, to estimate the risks due to watering crops with PW and will encourage its sustainable reuse in water-scarce areas.", "Differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on agricultural production in Nigeria: Any lessons for climate-smart agriculture? ": "The rain-fed agriculture system is vulnerable to climate change impact. However, such impact may also vary by aggregate and sub-sectoral levels of agricultural production. The impact of climate change and variability on agricultural production would engender appropriate policies and practices towards a sustainable agricultural production system. We investigated the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on agricultural production in Nigeria, and drew lessons for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Nigeria. Using time series data that spanned 43 years and econometric analytical technique, we quantified the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on aggregate production and sub-sectors (all crops, staples, livestock, fisheries and forestry). Irrigation had positive and significant impact on aggregate agricultural production as well as all sub-sectors of agriculture. These findings suggest the need for the minimization of the impact of climate-induced production risks through CSA which would involve complementary development of more arable land areas under irrigation in Nigeria. Irrigation would also enhance complementary agricultural water management for the development of all the sub-sectors of agriculture, thereby enhancing food security and sustainable agricultural production under prevailing climate change and variability.", "Drought response in field grown potatoes and the interactions between canopy growth and yield ": "Potato is an important food crop with high yields. However when exposed to drought it suffers major yield losses. Considering its global importance and the increasing incidence of drought due to climate change, research toward drought tolerance in potato remains imperative. We have studied a set of 103 commercial cultivars representing the genetic diversity in the European potato market. The cultivars were grown in different field locations in three subsequent years (2013\u20132015). Our aim was to understand how different field drought regimes affect canopy growth in potato, and how these effects translate to tuber yield. The field environmental conditions were monitored, and pictures of canopy ground cover during the growing season were taken. Canopy growth parameters were extracted by an iterative method using the beta sigmoid growth function to model canopy growth. At harvest, tuber yield was scored and tuber size was graded. The GGE (Genotype and Genotype-by-Environment) bi-plot and Finlay Wilkinson\u2019s Regression were used to investigate Genotype x Environment interactions. We observed that the timing of the drought occurrence differentially affected canopy growth and tuber yield. Under drought stress, fast attainment of exponential growth and maximum canopy cover had negative effects on tuber formation and tuber bulking. Growth rate, maximum canopy cover, and area under the canopy curve (photosynthetic capacity over the growth season) were more important for tuber bulking than they were for tuber formation under drought stress. Cultivars with high yield were identified as potential material for improvement to drought tolerance. These findings will contribute to the breeding for drought-tolerant potato amidst the threats of climate change.", "Evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of continuous maize and maize and soybean in rotation in the upper Midwest U.S. ": "This study examined evapotranspiration (ET) from no-till, rainfed maize and soybean during three growing seasons (May-Sep) of normal rainfall years (2009, 2010, 2011) and a drought year (2012) in Michigan, USA, based on daily soil water uptake measured by time-domain reflectometry at multiple depths through the root zone. During normal rainfall years, growing-season ET was similar between continuous maize (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation: 471\u2009\u00b1\u200947\u2009mm) and maize in rotation (469\u2009\u00b1\u200951\u2009mm). During the drought year, ET decreased by only 3% for continuous maize but by 20% for maize in rotation. During the normal rainfall years, ET for soybean (453\u2009\u00b1\u200934\u2009mm) was statistically indistinguishable from ET for maize, and was lower during the drought year (333\u2009mm). Water use efficiency (WUE), calculated from harvest yield (grain\u2009+\u2009corn stover) and ET, was 25.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm-1 for continuous maize and 27.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121 for maize in rotation during the normal rainfall years, whereas WUEs for both continuous maize and maize in rotation were much lower in the 2012 drought year (14.0 and 15.5\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121, respectively), coincident with lower production. Soybean had a much lower WUE than maize during the three normal years (6.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121) and the drought year (4.57\u2009kg ha\u22121\u2009mm\u22121), also explained by lower yield. Both maize and soybean tended to use all available water in the soil profile; there was no consistent difference in ET between these crops, while yield varied markedly from year to year.", "Deficit irrigation and emerging fruit crops as a strategy to save water in Mediterranean semiarid agrosystems ": "Water scarcity in Mediterranean climate areas will be progressively aggravated by climate change, population increase and urban, tourism and industrial activities. To protect water resources and their integrity for future use and to improve biodiversity, besides following advanced deficit irrigation strategies in fruit cultivation, attention could well be directed towards what are at present underused plant materials able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality. To this end, the state of the art as regards deficit irrigation strategies and the response of some very interesting emerging fruit crops [jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.), loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.), pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) and pomegranate (Punica granatum L.)] are reviewed. The strengths and weaknesses of deficit irrigation strategies and the mechanisms developed by these emerging fruit crops in the face of water stress are discussed. The response of these crops to deficit irrigation, with special attention paid to the effect on yield but also on fruit quality and health-related chemical compounds, was analysed in order to assess their suitability for saving water in Mediterranean semiarid agrosystems and to analyze their potential role as alternatives to currently cultivated fruit crops with higher water requirements. Finally, the factors involved in establishing an identity brand (hydroSOS) to protect fruits obtained under specific DI conditions are discussed.", "A review of coupled hydrologic and crop growth models ": "Coupling hydrologic and crop models is becoming an increasingly important approach in the development of agro-hydrologic theme. Scientists and decision makers working to address issues in the areas of resource conservation and agricultural productivity are interested in the complementary processing of the two coupled systems. The objective of the present work is to review relevant studies related to hydrologic and crop models coupling, and to analyze the domain applicability, limitations, and other considerations.", "Understanding clients, providers and the institutional dimensions of irrigation services in developing countries: A study of water markets in Bangladesh ": "Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated nations that nonetheless has largely achieved staple self-sufficiency. This development has been enabled in part by the rapid proliferation of small-scale irrigation pumps that enabled double rice cropping, as well as by a competitive market system in which farmers purchase water at affordable fee-for-service prices from private irrigation pump owners. Excess groundwater abstraction in areas of high shallow tube-well density and increased fuel costs for pumping have however called into question the sustainability of Bangladesh\u2019s groundwater irrigation economy. Cost-saving agronomic methods are called for, alongside aligned policies, markets, and farmers\u2019 incentives. The study assesses different institutions and water-pricing methods for irrigation services that have emerged in Bangladesh, each of which varies in their incentive structure for water conservation, and the level of economic risk involved for farmers and service providers. Using primary data collected from 139 irrigation service providers and 556 client-farmers, we empirically examine the structure of irrigation service types and associated market and institutional dimensions. Our findings demonstrate that competition among pump owners, social capital and personal relationships, and economic and agronomic risk perceptions of both pump owners and farmers significantly influence the structure of irrigation services and water pricing methods. Greater competition among pump owners increases the likelihood of pay-per-hour services and reduces the likelihood of crop harvest sharing arrangements. Based on these findings, we explore policy implications for enhancing irrigation services and irrigation sustainability in Bangladesh.", "Impacts of plastic film mulching on crop yields, soil water, nitrate, and organic carbon in Northwestern China: A meta-analysis ": "In order to increase crop yield in semi-arid and arid areas, plastic film mulching (PFM) is widely used in Northwestern China. To date, many studies have addressed the effects of PFM on soil physical and biochemical properties in rain-fed agriculture in Northwestern China, but the findings of different studies are often contradictory. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the impacts of PFM on soil water content, soil nutrients and food production is needed. We compiled the results of 1278 observations to evaluate the overall effects of PFM on soil water content, the distribution of nitrate and soil organic carbon, and crop yield in rain-fed agriculture in Northwestern China. Our results showed that PFM increased soil moisture and nitrate concentration in topsoils (0\u201320\u202fcm) by 12.9% and 28.2%, respectively, but slightly decreased (1.8%) soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the 0\u201310\u202fcm soil layer. PFM significantly increased grain yields by 43.1%, with greatest effect in spring maize (79.4%). When related to cumulative precipitation during the crop growing season, yield increase from PFM was greatest (72.8%) at 200\u2013300\u202fmm, which was attributed to the large increase for spring maize and potato, implying that crop zoning would be beneficial for PFM in this region. When related to N application rate, crop yields benefited most from PFM (80.2%) at 200\u2013300\u202fkg/ha. A cost-benefit analysis indicated that PFM increased economic return by an average of 29.5%, with the best improvement for spring maize (71.1%) and no increase for spring wheat. In conclusion, PFM can significantly increase crop yield and economic return (especially for spring maize) in rain-fed agriculture areas of Northwestern China. Crop zoning is recommended for PFM to achieve the largest economic benefit. However, full account needs to be taken of the environmental impacts relating to N loss, SOC depletion and film pollution to evaluate the sustainability of PFM systems and further research is required to quantify and mitigate these impacts.", "Cucumber (Cucumis sativus, L.) water use efficiency (WUE) under plastic mulch and drip irrigation ": "To study the effect of two types of plastic mulch (transparent and black) with drip irrigation on water requirement and Cucumber (Cucumis sativus, L.) yield, in addition to their effect on Maturity time. Trials were carried out at Teezen Research Station, Hama Agricultural Research Center, GCSAR, Syria, during 2009\u20132010 growing seasons using complete randomized block design with three replicates. Soil characteristics were followed too because they reflect the effects of plastic mulch. Treatments were transparent mulched drip irrigation (DI+TM), black mulched drip irrigation (DI+BM), drip irrigation without mulching (DI) and surface furrow irrigation (SI). The results of the study indicated that (DI+TM) treatment excelled all other treatments at yield and water use efficiency (WUE), where its yield was 63.9tha\u22121, and (WUE) was 0.262tha\u22121\n                     mm\u22121, while (DI+BM) treatment produced 57.9tha\u22121, with a (WUE) of 0.238tha\u22121\n                     mm\u22121. However cucumber yield and WUE declined in the remaining treatments of no mulch (DI) and (SI) to reach 44.1tha\u22121 with 0.153tha\u22121\n                     mm\u22121 and 37.7tha\u22121 with 0.056tha\u22121\n                     mm\u22121, respectively. The results showed that (DI+TM) treatment gave the highest soil temperature and moisture during both of the seasons in comparison to (DI+BM). This enhanced its vegetative growth and almost doubled its productivity compared to the SI treatment.", "The dynamics of the relationship between household decision-making and farm household income in small-scale irrigation schemes in southern Africa ": "Irrigation has been promoted as a strategy to reduce poverty and improve livelihoods in southern Africa. Households\u2019 livelihood strategies within small-scale irrigation schemes have become increasingly complex and diversified. Strategies consist of farm income from rain-fed and irrigated cropping as well as livestock and an increasing dependence on off-farm income. The success of these strategies depends on the household\u2019s ability to make decisions about how to utilize its\u2019 financial, labour, land and water resources. This study explores the dynamics of decision-making in households on-farm household income within six small-scale irrigation schemes, across three southern African countries. Household survey data (n\u2009=\u2009402) was analyzed using ordered probit and ordinary least squares regression. Focus group discussions and field observations provided qualitative data on decision-making in the six schemes. We found strong support for the notion that decision-making dynamics strongly influence total household income. Households make trade-offs between irrigation, dryland, livestock and off-farm work when they allocate their labour resources to maximize household income; as opposed to maximizing the income from any individual component of their livelihood strategy, such as irrigation. Combined with the impact of the small plot size of irrigated land, this is likely to result in sub-optimal benefits from expensive investments in irrigation infrastructure. Policy-makers must consider this when developing and implementing new policies.", "UAVs challenge to assess water stress for sustainable agriculture ": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present an exciting opportunity to monitor crop fields with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing capable of improving water stress management in agriculture. In this study, we reviewed the application of different types of UAVs using different remote sensors and compared their performance with ground-truth plant data. Several reflectance indices, such as NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI and PRInorm obtained from UAVs have shown positive correlations related to water stress indicators such as water potential (\u03a8) and stomatal conductance (g\n                     \n                        s\n                     ). Nevertheless, they have performed differently in diverse crops; thus, their uses and applications are also discussed in this study. Thermal imagery is also a common remote sensing technology used to assess water stress in plants, via thermal indices (calculated using artificial surfaces as references), estimates of the difference between canopy and air temperature, and even canopy conductance estimates derived from leaf energy balance models. These indices have shown a great potential to determine field stress heterogeneity using unmanned aerial platforms. It has also been proposed that chlorophyll fluorescence could be an even better indicator of plant photosynthesis and water use efficiency under water stress. Therefore, developing systems and methodologies to easily retrieve fluorescence from UAVs should be a priority for the near future. After a decade of work with UAVs, recently emerging technologies have developed more user-friendly aerial platforms, such as the multi-copters, which offer industry, science, and society new opportunities. Their use as high-throughput phenotyping platforms for real field conditions and also for water stress management increasing temporal and resolution scales could improve our capacity to determine important crop traits such as yield or stress tolerance for breeding purposes.", "Assessment of meteorological and agricultural droughts using in-situ observations and remote sensing data ": "Most research on drought assessment adopted historical in-situ observations, however, there has been increased data availability from remote sensing during the recent years. This study utilizes the two sources of data in drought assessment. Using the historical in-situ observations, the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological drought were firstly investigated by calculating the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at 1, 3, 6-month time scales in Northeast China. Using remote sensing data, the combined deficit index (CDI) for agricultural drought assessment was computed based on tri-monthly sum of deficit in antecedent rainfall and deficit in monthly NDVI at land cover type and sub-type levels in the same region. In the end, the agricultural drought calculated by the CDI was evaluated against the deficit in crop yield, as well as deficit in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET), in order to verify the applicability of the CDI for agricultural drought assessment in the study region. The results showed that the CDI has better correlations with the SPEI (R2\u202f=\u202f0.48) than the SPI (R2\u202f=\u202f0.05) at 3-month scales with weight factor a\u202f=\u202f0.5 in dry farming areas. The spatial pattern of the CDI showed that the area of agricultural drought increased from July to October. In addition, a significant linear correlation was found between the CDI and anomaly in annual agricultural yield (R2\u202f=\u202f0.55), and anomaly in monthly land surface temperature (R2\u202f=\u202f0.42). The results prove that the CDI calculated by remote sensing data is not only a reliable indicator for agricultural drought assessment in Northeast China, but also provides useful information for agricultural drought disaster prevention and mitigation, and water management improvement.", "Treated agro-industrial wastewater irrigation of tomato crop: Effects on qualitative/quantitative characteristics of production and microbiological properties of the soil ": "A comparative study was carried out to evaluate the effects of two water irrigation sources on the quality and microbiological safety of tomato plants and fruit, and on the microbiological soil properties: irrigation with groundwater (GW) and with treated agro-industrial wastewater (TW). In a field experiment in southern Italy (Apulia region), the physico-chemical characteristics of the irrigation waters and the fruit quality parameters were determined. Escherichia coli, fecal Enterococci and Salmonella spp. were also monitored in the irrigation waters, tomato plant and fruit, and root-zone soil. Bacteriological analysis for total heterotrophic counts (THCs) were determined for plant, fruit, and soil samples. The irrigation water source did not significantly affect yield quantitative traits. However, with GW, the marketable fruit yield was higher than with TW (\u223c82 vs. \u223c79Mgha\u22121, respectively). For both irrigation treatments, the most important qualitative parameters that characterize the processing tomato fruit (i.e., dry matter content, pH, soluble solid content, color parameters) were in agreement with reports in the literature. For the microbiological results, the mean levels of E. coli and fecal Enterococci were 4408 and 3804CFU 100ml\u22121, respectively, for TW (above the Italian guidelines for TW re-use). For the tomato plant and fruit, no E. coli isolated in either, and fecal coliforms and THC were not influenced by the irrigation waters (P\n                     >0.05). Total bacterial enumeration by quantitative PCR was lower in soil irrigated with GW, than TW (3.69 vs. 4.02, \u00d7106, respectively). Moreover, soil microbial community patterns substantially differed between the two water treatments. These data show that while fecal indicators are not affected, the community composition and dynamics of the whole bacterial population in soil is influenced by the different qualities of these waters used for irrigation.", "Urban agriculture and small farm water use: Case studies and trends from Cache Valley, Utah ": "The landscape of water in Utah is changing due to population growth, conversion of agricultural land to urban development, and increasing awareness of water scarcity. At the same time, Utah is experiencing a growing number of urban and small farms, but knowledge of water use in this sector is limited. Better understanding of what occurs at the field level on urban and small farms can aid state water use estimates and conservation efforts, and assist farmers in moving towards wiser water management. For the 2015 growing season, we performed irrigation evaluations for 24 urban and small farms in Cache Valley, Utah and we explore the results through case studies and identify trends among gross irrigation depth and field variables including field size, irrigation method, application uniformity, and scheduling practices. Results show a great degree of heterogeneity in irrigation methods, equipment used, and management practices. The beneficial consumed fraction of irrigation water ranged from 0.06 to 1.0. Small fields had lower application uniformities and greater irrigation depths than large fields. Surface irrigated fields had higher irrigation depths than sprinkle and drip irrigated fields. Additionally, fields using a fixed irrigation schedule had higher depths than fields that were irrigated inconsistently due to other factors. The results show that urban and small farm irrigators need improved knowledge of proper irrigation management. Irrigators, university extension services, and state water authorities working in this sector need to recognize the link between proper management and total water use, and focus more efforts on improving management, specifically how to use 1) low-cost methods to measure flow rates, 2) simple irrigation scheduling tools, and 3) improve application uniformity.", "Evapotranspiration over a rainfed maize field in northeast China: How are relationships between the environment and terrestrial evapotranspiration mediated by leaf area? ": "As a central process in the hydrological system and the climate system, terrestrial evapotranspiration is a key factor furthering our understanding of the climate change processes. Knowledge of factors controlling the variability in evapotranspiration is crucial for the prediction of the fate of terrestrial ecosystems under environmental changes. Based on long-term (2005\u20132014) eddy covariance flux data observed at a rainfed maize site in northeast China, the purpose of this study was to clarify the environmental regulation of actual evapotranspiration (ET) and the extent to which the regulatory effects on ET are directly or indirectly mediated by changes in biotic factors, using the structural equation modeling (SEM) method. The results showed that annual total ET was 397\u2009\u00b1\u200935\u2009mm for the rainfed maize site in comparison with 575\u2009\u00b1\u2009169\u2009mm of precipitation (Prec), with an ET/Prec ratio ranging from 0.43 (2012) to 1.14 (2014). It was revealed that net radiation (Rn) was the primary controlling factor of the maize ET, followed by leaf area index (LAI), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature (Ta), and soil water content (SWC). The adjusted SEM models explained 71%, 67%, and 67% of the variation in daily ET of the maize growing season (ETgs) for dry, normal, and moist years, respectively. Rn and VPD dominated ETgs in an increasing order of dry, normal, and moist years. Conversely, the effects of LAI and Ta on ETgs followed the opposite trend. This indicated that drought may increase the sensitivity of maize ET to temperature changes, and decrease the sensitivity of maize ET to radiation changes. In SEM analysis, LAI played an important mediating role in the relationship among climate, soil variables, and ETgs. Rn, VPD, Ta, and SWC all had significant indirect effects on ETgs mediated through LAI. At the annual scale, it was identified that most active days could be a robust predictor of annual ET.", "Effects of potassium rates and types on growth, leaf gas exchange and biochemical changes in rice (Oryza sativa) planted under cyclic water stress ": "Three levels of potassium rates [80kgK2Oha\u22121, 120kgK2Oha\u22121 and 160kgK2Oha\u22121) and two types potassium (KCl and K2SO4) on rice under cyclic water stress 15 days and the absolute control (80kgK2Oha\u22121 of KCl fertilizer on rice under control flooded) were exposed to rice to investigate the influence of potassium in minimizing cyclic water stress effects in rice. It was found as fertilization rates increased from 80>120>160kgK2Oha\u22121 the production of proline was increased. The increase in proline production was simultaneously enhanced the production of Catalase and Maliondialdehyde. As the potassium rate increased from 80>120>160kgK2Oha\u22121, the transpiration rate was observed to be increased in both potassium types. The result suggested that high potassium rates would reduce water stress effects by having high transpiration rate. High transpiration rate would increase the nutrient uptake that would repair the damage tissue under water stress thus reduce the oxidative stress of rice under water stress condition. This been showed by high significant positive correlations of transpiration rate with CAT activity (r\n                     =0.871; p\n                     \u22640.05), MDA (r\n                     =0.914; p\n                     \u22640.05) and Proline (r\n                     =0.842; p\n                     \u22640.05). It was found that the increase of K rates by KCl increased NAR higher than the increased K rates in K2SO4. This might be due to higher absorption of K element in rice by KCl compared to K2SO4. The study has showed that application of potassium either KCl or K2SO4 would minimize the effects on rice growth and physiology under cyclic water stress. The current study also suggested that plant tolerate to cyclic water stress by increased the production of proline, MDA and decrease of Catalase activity to protect the plant from damage from water stress.", "A WEAP-MODFLOW surface water-groundwater model for the irrigated Miyandoab plain, Urmia lake basin, Iran: Multi-objective calibration and quantification of historical drought impacts ": "This study develops and applies the first coupled surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) flow model for the irrigated Miyandoab plain located in the Urmia basin, in the northwest of Iran. The model is implemented using a dynamic coupling between MODFLOW and WEAP and consists of spatially distributed monthly water balances for the aquifer, root-zone, rivers, canals, and reservoirs. Multi-objective calibration of the model using river discharge and GW level data yields accurate simulation of historical conditions, and results in better constrained parameters compared to using either data source alone. Model simulations show that crop water demand cannot be met during droughts due to limited GW pumping capacity, and that increased GW pumping has a relatively strong impact on GW levels due to the small specific yield of the aquifer. The SW-GW model provides a unique tool for exploring management options that sustain agricultural production and downstream flow to the shrinking Urmia Lake.", "Irrigation management under water scarcity ": "The use of water for agricultural production in water scarcity regions requires innovative and sustainable research, and an appropriate transfer of technologies. This paper discusses some of these aspects, mainly relative to on-farm irrigation management including the use of treated wastewater and saline waters. First, the paper proposes some concepts relative to water scarcity, concerning aridity, drought, desertification and water shortage, as well as policies to cope with these water stressed regimes. Conceptual approaches on irrigation performances, water use and water savings are reviewed in a wide perspective. This is followed by a discussion of supply management to cope with water scarcity, giving particular attention to the use of wastewater and low-quality waters, including the respective impacts on health and the environment as water scarcity is requiring that waters of inferior quality be increasingly used for irrigation. The paper then focuses on demand management, starting with aspects relating to the improvement of irrigation methods and the respective performances, mainly the distribution uniformity (DU) as a fundamental tool to reduce the demand for water at the farm level, and to control the negative environmental impacts of over-irrigation, including salt stressed areas. Discussions are supported by recent research results. The suitability of irrigation methods for using treated wastewaters and saline waters is analysed. Supplemental irrigation (SI) and deficit irrigation strategies are also discussed, including limitations on the applicability of related practices. The paper also identifies the need to adopt emerging technologies for water management as well as to develop appropriate methodologies for the analysis of social, economic, and environmental benefits of improved irrigation management.", "Pore-scale imaging and modelling ": "Pore-scale imaging and modelling \u2013 digital core analysis \u2013 is becoming a routine service in the oil and gas industry, and has potential applications in contaminant transport and carbon dioxide storage. This paper briefly describes the underlying technology, namely imaging of the pore space of rocks from the nanometre scale upwards, coupled with a suite of different numerical techniques for simulating single and multiphase flow and transport through these images. Three example applications are then described, illustrating the range of scientific problems that can be tackled: dispersion in different rock samples that predicts the anomalous transport behaviour characteristic of highly heterogeneous carbonates; imaging of super-critical carbon dioxide in sandstone to demonstrate the possibility of capillary trapping in geological carbon storage; and the computation of relative permeability for mixed-wet carbonates and implications for oilfield waterflood recovery. The paper concludes by discussing limitations and challenges, including finding representative samples, imaging and simulating flow and transport in pore spaces over many orders of magnitude in size, the determination of wettability, and upscaling to the field scale. We conclude that pore-scale modelling is likely to become more widely applied in the oil industry including assessment of unconventional oil and gas resources. It has the potential to transform our understanding of multiphase flow processes, facilitating more efficient oil and gas recovery, effective contaminant removal and safe carbon dioxide storage.", "Green-blue water accounting in a soil water balance ": "It has become common practice to speak about \u2018green\u2019 versus \u2018blue\u2019 water consumption, in order to distinguish between consumption of rainwater versus groundwater or surface water. The two sources of water differ in terms of possibilities for storage and use. Whereas industrial, municipal and livestock water supply primarily depend on blue water, crop cultivation relies on both green and blue water. Discriminating between green and blue water consumption in a crop field is not straightforward: consumption refers to evapotranspiration (ET) and water contained in the harvested crop, which both appear in undifferentiated form. One cannot see which part of ET or the water in a plant originates from rainwater and which part from irrigation water. In this paper I propose a generic and physically based method to differentiate green and blue evaporation (E) and green and blue transpiration (T) by daily accounting of the fractions green and blue water in each soil and vegetation layer. The green and blue fractions of all water fluxes leaving a soil or vegetation layer in a day depend on the average green and blue water fractions in that soil or vegetation layer during that day. This method allows for an accurate assessment of irrigation efficiency (the ratio of blue water transpiration to the irrigation water applied), and for a precise estimation of green and blue water footprints of crop production (the ratio of either green ET or blue ET to the crop yield).", "Development and evaluation of a framework for global flood hazard mapping ": "Nowadays, the development of high-resolution flood hazard models have become feasible at continental and global scale, and their application in developing countries and data-scarce regions can be extremely helpful to increase preparedness of population and reduce catastrophic impacts.\n                  The present work describes the development of a novel procedure for global flood hazard mapping, based on the most recent advances in large scale flood modelling. We derive a long-term dataset of daily river discharges from the hydrological simulations of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS). Streamflow data is downscaled on a high resolution river network and processed to provide the input for local flood inundation simulations, performed with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. All flood-prone areas identified along the river network are then merged to create continental flood hazard maps for different return periods at 30\u2032\u2032 resolution. We evaluate the performance of our methodology in several river basins across the globe by comparing simulated flood maps with both official hazard maps and a mosaic of flooded areas detected from satellite images. The evaluation procedure also includes comparisons with the results of other large scale flood models. We further investigate the sensitivity of the flood modelling framework to several parameters and modelling approaches and identify strengths, limitations and possible improvements of the methodology.", "Spatio-temporal analysis of compound hydro-hazard extremes across the\u00a0UK ": "There exists an increasing need to understand the impact of climate change on the hydrological extremes of flood and drought, collectively referred to as \u2018hydro-hazards\u2019. At present, current methodology are limited in their scope, particularly with respect to inadequate representation of the uncertainty in the hydroclimatological modelling chain.\n                  This paper proposes spatially consistent comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the identification of compound hydro-hazard hotspots \u2013 hotspots of change where concurrent increase in mean annual flood and drought events is projected. We apply a quasi-ergodic analysis of variance (QE-ANOVA) framework, to detail both the magnitude and the sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain for the mean projected mean change signal whilst accounting for non-stationarity. The framework is designed for application across a wide geographical range and is thus readily transferable. We illustrate the ability of the framework through application to 239 UK catchments based on hydroclimatological projections from the EDgE project (5 CMI5-GCMs and 3 HMs, forced under RCP8.5).\n                  The results indicate that half of the projected hotspots are temporally concurrent or temporally successive within the year, exacerbating potential impacts on society. The north-east of Scotland and south-west of the UK were identified as spatio-temporally compound hotspot regions and are of particular concern. This intensification of the hydrologic dynamic (timing and seasonality of hydro-hazards) over a limited time frame represents a major challenge for future water management.\n                  Hydrological models were identified as the largest source of variability, in some instances exceeding 80% of the total variance. Critically, clear spatial variability in the sources of modelling uncertainty was also observed; highlighting the need to apply a spatially consistent methodology, such as that presented. This application raises important questions regarding the spatial variability of hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty. In terms of water management planning, such findings allow for more focussed studies with a view to improving the projections which inform the adaptation process.", "Flood risk and its reduction in China ": "Despite massive flood protection efforts in China, undertaken since the ancient times, disastrous floods continue to plague the country. In this paper, we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in China. First, we review published results (including our own works) on change detection in observed records of intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We provide information on essential features of extreme floods in last decades \u2013 floods on large rivers, urban floods, and flash floods. Next, we review available projections for the future (including our own results), related to intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We try to interpret the difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications. Since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large, projections have to be interpreted with caution, because of the impact on decisions related to climate change adaptation, flood risk reduction, and water resources management. We review flood risk reduction strategies in China, focusing on the present situation and division of responsibilities. China has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness, by both structural (\u201chard\u201d) defences, such as: dikes, dams and flood control reservoirs, and diversions, as well as non-structural (\u201csoft\u201d) measures: spatial planning and zoning; watershed management (source control), flood forecasting and warning systems; and awareness raising. The strategy of flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding.", "Pore occupancy, relative permeability and flow intermittency measurements using X-ray micro-tomography in a complex carbonate ": "We imaged the steady-state flow of brine and decane (oil) at different fractional flows during dual injection in a micro-porous limestone, Estaillades, using X-ray micro-tomography. We applied differential imaging to: (a) distinguish micro-porous regions from macro-pores, and (b) determine fluid pore occupancy in both regions, and relative permeability at a capillary number, Ca\u00a0=\u00a07.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126. The sample porosity was approximately 28%, with 7% in macro-pores and 21% in pores that could not be directly resolved (micro-porosity). Fluid occupancy in micro-porosity was classified into three sub-phases: micro-pore space with oil, micro-pore space with brine, and micro-pores partially filled with oil and brine. Our method indicated an initially higher oil recovery from micro-porosity, consistent with waterflooding in a water-wet rock. The fractional flow and relative permeabilities of the two fluids were obtained from measurements of the pressure differential across the sample and the saturation calculated from the images. The brine saturation and relative permeabilities are impacted by the presence of water-wet micro-porosity which provides additional connectivity to the phases. Furthermore, we find that in addition to brine and decane, a fraction of the macroscopic pore space contains an intermittent phase, which is occupied either by brine or decane during the hour-long scan time. Pore and throat occupancy of oil, brine and intermittent phase were obtained from images at different fractional flows using the generalized pore network extracted from the image of macro-pores. The intermittent phase, where the occupancy fluctuated between oil-filled and brine-filled, was predominantly located in the small and intermediate size pores and throats. Overall, we establish a new experimental methodology to: (i) quantify initial and recovered oil in micro-pores, (ii) characterise intermittent flow, and (iii) measure steady-state relative permeability in carbonates, which is shown to be greatly influenced by micro-porosity.", "Assessing seasonal drought variations and trends over Central Europe ": "The relevance of drought is still often underestimated for temperate climate regions like Central Europe that are characterized by on average ample precipitation. Nonetheless, several drought events in recent years (e.g. 1992, 2003, 2015 and 2018) demonstrated that droughts are a relevant factor for several economic activities (e.g., agriculture, water dependent industries, energy supply, etc.) in Central Europe. This is particularly true for the vegetation period, where increasing evapotranspiration rates due to rising atmospheric temperatures are intensifying existing drought conditions that originally developed from rainfalls deficits. The contribution of this study is an assessment of the long-term variability of drought conditions and seasonal climate trends within 1951\u20132015 based on a collective of 91 climate stations from the national meteorological services of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. Using a set of eight drought and three heavy precipitation indices an aggregated evaluation of seasonal precipitation characteristics is done and the driest seasons are identified for the entire study area as well as for four sub-regions. It is shown that the choice of the study period matters (1951\u20132015 vs. 1961\u20132015) as the pronounced (multi-)decadal variability of drought conditions restricts the temporal stability of computed trends. The drought trends computed for 1951\u20132015 are similar in direction, but generally smaller in magnitude than those of the ten year shorter period 1961\u20132015, as the 1950s have been a very dry decade in Central Europe. Seasonally, drying trends were observed for spring and less pronounced for summer, while autumn and winter show wetting trends. The seasonal trends are sensitive to shifts in the season definition by one month. Vegetation period I (VP-I) shows stronger drying trends, but less increases in heavy precipitation than spring, while the drought trends are less pronounced in vegetation period II (VP-II) as compared to the summer season, but more trends towards heavy precipitation increases occur in VP-II. These differences are explained by the daily trends in the seasonal cycle that show the strongest drying in April, June and the beginning of August and the strongest wetting in March and September. Generally, heavy precipitation increases prevail over decreasing trends in all seasons, whereby stations with strong drought trends generally have smaller positive or even negative heavy precipitation trends. A simultaneous occurrence of drought and heavy precipitation increases is observed in spring at several stations, particularly in sub-region West.", "The water footprint of wood for lumber, pulp, paper, fuel and firewood ": "This paper presents the first estimate of global water use in the forestry sector related to roundwood production for lumber, pulp, paper, fuel and firewood. For the period 1961\u20132010, we estimate forest evaporation at a high spatial resolution level and attribute total water consumption to various forest products, including ecosystem services. Global water consumption for roundwood production increased by 25% over 50 years to 961\u00d7109 m3/y (96% green; 4% blue) in 2001\u20132010. The water footprint per m3 of wood is significantly smaller in (sub)tropical forests compared to temperate/boreal forests, because (sub)tropical forests host relatively more value next to wood production in the form of other ecosystem services. In terms of economic water productivity and energy yield from bio-ethanol per unit of water, roundwood is rather comparable with major food, feed and energy crops. Recycling of wood products could effectively reduce the water footprint of the forestry sector, thereby leaving more water available for the generation of other ecosystem services. Intensification of wood production can only reduce the water footprint per unit of wood if the additional wood value per ha outweighs the loss of value of other ecosystem services, which is often not the case in (sub)tropical forests. The results of this study contribute to a more complete picture of the human appropriation of water, thus feeding the debate on water for food or feed versus energy and wood.", "(Multi)wavelets increase both accuracy and efficiency of standard Godunov-type hydrodynamic models ": "This paper presents a scaled reformulation of a robust second-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) solver for the Shallow Water Equations (SWE), with guiding principles on how it can be naturally extended to fit into the multiresolution analysis of multiwavelets (MW). Multiresolution analysis applied to the flow and topography data enables the creation of an adaptive MWDG2 solution on a non-uniform grid. The multiresolution analysis also permits control of the adaptive model error by a single user-prescribed parameter. This results in an adaptive MWDG2 solver that can fully exploit the local (de)compression of piecewise-linear modelled data, and from which a first-order finite volume version (FV1) is directly obtainable based on the Haar wavelet (HFV1) for local (de)compression of piecewise-constant modelled data. The behaviour of the adaptive HFV1 and MWDG2 solvers is systematically studied on a number of well-known hydraulic tests that cover all elementary aspects relevant to accurate, efficient and robust modelling. The adaptive solvers are run starting from a baseline mesh with a single element, and their accuracy and efficiency are measured referring to standard FV1 and DG2 simulations on the uniform grid involving the finest resolution accessible by the adaptive solvers. Our findings reveal that the MWDG2 solver can achieve the same accuracy as the DG2 solver but with a greater efficiency than the FV1 solver due to the smoothness of its piecewise-linear basis, which enables more aggressive coarsening than with the piecewise-constant basis in the HFV1 solver. This suggests a great potential for the MWDG2 solver to efficiently handle the depth and breadth in resolution variability, while also being a multiresolution mesh generator. Accompanying model software and simulation data are openly available online.", "The impact of porous media heterogeneity on non-Darcy flow behaviour from pore-scale simulation ": "The effect of pore-scale heterogeneity on non-Darcy flow behaviour is investigated by means of direct flow simulations on 3-D images of a beadpack, Bentheimer sandstone and Estaillades carbonate. The critical Reynolds number indicating the cessation of the creeping Darcy flow regime in Estaillades carbonate is two orders of magnitude smaller than in Bentheimer sandstone, and is three orders of magnitude smaller than in the beadpack. It is inferred from the examination of flow field features that the emergence of steady eddies in pore space of Estaillades at elevated fluid velocities accounts for the early transition away from the Darcy flow regime. The non-Darcy coefficient \u03b2, the onset of non-Darcy flow, and the Darcy permeability for all samples are obtained and compared to available experimental data demonstrating the predictive capability of our approach. X-ray imaging along with direct pore-scale simulation of flow provides a viable alternative to experiments and empirical correlations for predicting non-Darcy flow parameters such as the \u03b2 factor, and the onset of non-Darcy flow.", "Flow and bed morphology response to the introduction of wood logs for sediment management ": "Submerged vanes alter sediment transport by inducing a secondary circulation without significantly compromising the conveyance capacity of the river. Here, a laboratory study is conducted to investigate whether wood logs or trunks can be used for sediment management. The effectivity of a traditional vane field is compared to set-ups with screens of stacked logs, and large individual trunks. Results indicate that all three set-ups redistribute sediment but that the trunks are least effective in inducing a secondary circulation and cause higher turbulence and drag, leading to a stronger decrease in streamwise velocity. We conclude that a field of trunks acts as a sediment trap because of a strong reduction of the streamwise velocity, without a strong secondary flow such as dominant in the other configurations. Screens of stacked logs can be successfully implemented in rivers, as they are only slightly less effective than traditional vanes. The risk of piping underneath objects and the associated scour are points of concern.", "Relational analysis of the resource nexus in arid land crop production ": "While a large number of descriptive studies have delineated the interlinkages between water, food and energy resources in the last decade, there is still need for systematic conceptualization of resource nexus interconnections. This paper proposes a theory of relational analysis of the nexus based on the analytical concept of nexus networks. A taxonomy of nexus interconnections, detailing sequential and hierarchical connections, is characterized between and amongst the technosphere and biosphere. We illustrate the use of a novel diagnostic tool with regard to its ability to integrate macro-, meso- and microscale drivers of nexus problems. We apply this framework to problems generated by intensive crop production for exportation in an arid landscape (driven by external markets) and sustainable management of water resources (driven by public policies) in a southern Spanish region. We elucidate interconnected causal mechanisms for groundwater overexploitation and profile different social-ecological patterns on a spatially-explicit basis. The proposed approach is capable of accounting for the water-energy-food resource nexus in an integrated and multi-level fashion, addressing the tensions generated by both multi-functionality and resource entanglement in complex social-ecological systems.", "Understanding and managing the food-energy-water nexus \u2013 opportunities for water resources research ": "Studies on the food, energy, and water (FEW) nexus lay a shared foundation for researchers, policy makers, practitioners, and stakeholders to understand and manage linked production, utilization, and security of FEW systems. The FEW nexus paradigm provides the water community specific channels to move forward in interdisciplinary research where integrated water resources management (IWRM) has fallen short. Here, we help water researchers identify, articulate, utilize, and extend our disciplinary strengths within the broader FEW communities, while informing scientists in the food and energy domains about our unique skillset. This paper explores the relevance of existing and ongoing scholarship within the water community, as well as current research needs, for understanding FEW processes and systems and implementing FEW solutions through innovations in technologies, infrastructures, and policies. Following the historical efforts in IWRM, hydrologists, water resources engineers, economists, and policy analysts are provided opportunities for interdisciplinary studies among themselves and in collaboration with energy and food communities, united by a common path to achieve sustainability development goals.", "Seawater intrusion processes, investigation and management: Recent advances and future challenges ": "Seawater intrusion (SI) is a global issue, exacerbated by increasing demands for freshwater in coastal zones and predisposed to the influences of rising sea levels and changing climates. This review presents the state of knowledge in SI research, compares classes of methods for assessing and managing SI, and suggests areas for future research. We subdivide SI research into categories relating to processes, measurement, prediction and management. Considerable research effort spanning more than 50years has provided an extensive array of field, laboratory and computer-based techniques for SI investigation. Despite this, knowledge gaps exist in SI process understanding, in particular associated with transient SI processes and timeframes, and the characterization and prediction of freshwater\u2013saltwater interfaces over regional scales and in highly heterogeneous and dynamic settings. Multidisciplinary research is warranted to evaluate interactions between SI and submarine groundwater discharge, ecosystem health and unsaturated zone processes. Recent advances in numerical simulation, calibration and optimization techniques require rigorous field-scale application to contemporary issues of climate change, sea-level rise, and socioeconomic and ecological factors that are inseparable elements of SI management. The number of well-characterized examples of SI is small, and this has impeded understanding of field-scale processes, such as those controlling mixing zones, saltwater upconing, heterogeneity effects and other factors. Current SI process understanding is based mainly on numerical simulation and laboratory sand-tank experimentation to unravel the combined effects of tides, surface water\u2013groundwater interaction, heterogeneity, pumping and density contrasts. The research effort would benefit from intensive measurement campaigns to delineate accurately interfaces and their movement in response to real-world coastal aquifer stresses, encompassing a range of geological and hydrological settings.", "An argument-driven classification and comparison of reservoir operation optimization methods ": "Reservoir operation optimization aims to determine release and transfer decisions that maximise water management objectives such as ensuring a reliable water supply, hydropower production, mitigation of downstream floods, etc. An extensive and growing body of scientific literature exists on advancing and applying mathematical optimization methods to reservoir operation problems. In this paper, we review such literature according to a novel classification system of optimization approaches, which focuses on the characteristics of the actual operation problem \u2013 i.e. what needs to be optimized, or in mathematical terms, \u2018the argument\u2019 of the optimization problems - rather than the mathematical properties of the optimization algorithm. This enables us to discuss the advantages, limitations and the scope of application of the different optimisation methods; and to provide practical guidelines for matching the properties of a system and operation problem with a suitable optimization method. Alongside this paper we provide code to implement many of the methods we review for an illustrative reservoir system.", "Real-time simulation of surface water and groundwater with data assimilation ": "Data assimilation (DA) has proven to be a useful technique in real-time hydrological modeling and forecasting. Jointly assimilating both surface water and groundwater data has promising application value for hydrological simulations in areas where surface water and groundwater are closely linked; however, such studies have not been intensively reported. In addition, the role of the quality of precipitation forecast has not been fully addressed in real-time forecasting using a coupled surface water - groundwater model, where the model evaluation includes both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. In the present study, we use the MIKE SHE hydrological model code in conjunction with the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter DA technique. The study area is a small urbanized catchment in Denmark. The model is run in simulated real-time using historical numerical weather prediction forecasts. The results show that DA can significantly reduce model bias and thereby improve model performance for both surface water and groundwater simulations. Comparing the impact of DA and rainfall forecast quality, it is found that, for streamflow forecasts, the most important factor is the quality of the rainfall data; whereas for groundwater head forecasts, the initial state at time of forecast is more important. We also find that inclusion of rainfall forecast uncertainty may be important for simulating a single event, however, it is not vital if long-term average model performance is of interest.", "Analysis of the current world biofuel production under a water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus perspective ": "This paper assesses the sustainability of bioenergy production under a nexus perspective through a new efficiency type index. The index describes 1st generation biofuel production under the perspective of the implied consumption of natural resources. We consider the sustainability of energy production as a sequence of steps, each characterised by its efficiency, and propose an index which returns an overall efficiency value describing the adequacy or inadequacy of the considered processes under a nexus perspective. The direct application of the nexus index entails an indication of the possible improvements needed to move production towards most sustainable processes or places. Moreover, it allows evaluating the efficiency of the main crops currently used in biofuel production with respect to the water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus. The results depict countries presently capable of performing sustainable production of 1st generation biofuel from particular crops. Furthermore, the analysis of the single components of the nexus index allows understanding the effects of possible improvements (e.g. soil and water management, new generation biofuels) on the overall production efficiency under a nexus perspective.", "Capillary pressure\u2013saturation relationships for porous granular materials: Pore morphology method vs. pore unit assembly method ": "In studies of two-phase flow in complex porous media it is often desirable to have an estimation of the capillary pressure\u2013saturation curve prior to measurements. Therefore, we compare in this research the capability of three pore-scale approaches in reproducing experimentally measured capillary pressure\u2013saturation curves. To do so, we have generated 12 packings of spheres that are representative of four different glass-bead packings and eight different sand packings, for which we have found experimental data on the capillary pressure\u2013saturation curve in the literature. In generating the packings, we matched the particle size distributions and porosity values of the granular materials. We have used three different pore-scale approaches for generating the capillary pressure\u2013saturation curves of each packing: i) the Pore Unit Assembly (PUA) method in combination with the Mayer and Stowe\u2013Princen (MS\u2013P) approximation for estimating the entry pressures of pore throats, ii) the PUA method in combination with the hemisphere approximation, and iii) the Pore Morphology Method (PMM) in combination with the hemisphere approximation. The three approaches were also used to produce capillary pressure\u2013saturation curves for the coating layer of paper, used in inkjet printing. Curves for such layers are extremely difficult to determine experimentally, due to their very small thickness and the presence of extremely small pores (less than one micrometer in size). Results indicate that the PMM and PUA-hemisphere method give similar capillary pressure\u2013saturation curves, because both methods rely on a hemisphere to represent the air\u2013water interface. The ability of the hemisphere approximation and the MS\u2013P approximation to reproduce correct capillary pressure seems to depend on the type of particle size distribution, with the hemisphere approximation working well for narrowly distributed granular materials.", "Pore-scale contact angle measurements at reservoir conditions using X-ray microtomography ": "Contact angle is a principal control of the flow of multiple fluid phases through porous media; however its measurement on other than flat surfaces remains a challenge. A new method is presented for the measurement of the contact angle between immiscible fluids at the pore scale at reservoir conditions (10MPa and 50\u00b0C) inside a quarry limestone through the use of X-ray microtomography. It is applied to a super-critical CO2\u2013brine\u2013carbonate system by resampling the micro-CT data onto planes orthogonal to the contact lines, allowing for vectors to be traced along the grain surface and the CO2\u2013brine interface. A distribution of contact angles ranging from 35\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 is observed, indicating that the CO2\u2013brine\u2013carbonate system is weakly water-wet. This range of contact angles can be understood as the result of contact angle hysteresis and surface heterogeneity on a range of length scales. Surface heterogeneity is examined by comparison of micro-CT results with optical thin sections and SEM images.", "Understanding, management and modelling of urban hydrology and its consequences for receiving waters: A state of the art ": "Urban hydrology has evolved to improve the way urban runoff is managed for flood protection, public health and environmental protection. There have been significant recent advances in the measurement and prediction of urban rainfall, with technologies such as radar and microwave networks showing promise. The ability to predict urban hydrology has also evolved, to deliver models suited to the small temporal and spatial scales typical of urban and peri-urban applications. Urban stormwater management increasingly consider the needs of receiving environments as well as those of humans. There is a clear trend towards approaches that attempt to restore pre-development flow-regimes and water quality, with an increasing recognition that restoring a more natural water balance benefits not only the environment, but enhances the liveability of the urban landscape. Once regarded only as a nuisance, stormwater is now increasingly regarded as a resource. Despite the advances, many important challenges in urban hydrology remain. Further research into the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban rainfall is required to improve short-term rainfall prediction. The performance of stormwater technologies in restoring the water balance and in removing emerging priority pollutants remain poorly quantified. All of these challenges are overlaid by the uncertainty of climate change, which imposes a requirement to ensure that stormwater management systems are adaptable and resilient to changes. Urban hydrology will play a critical role in addressing these challenges.", "A global-scale two-layer transient groundwater model: Development and application to groundwater depletion ": "Groundwater is the world\u2019s largest accessible source of freshwater to satisfy human water needs. Moreover, groundwater buffers variable precipitation rates over time, thereby effectively sustaining river flows in times of droughts and evaporation in areas with shallow water tables. In this study, building on previous work, we simulate groundwater head fluctuations and groundwater storage changes in both confined and unconfined aquifer systems using a global-scale high-resolution (5\u2032) groundwater model by deriving new estimates of the distribution and thickness of confining layers. Inclusion of confined aquifer systems (estimated 6\u201320% of the total aquifer area) improves estimates of timing and amplitude of groundwater head fluctuations and changes groundwater flow paths and groundwater-surface water interaction rates. Groundwater flow paths within confining layers are shorter than paths in the underlying aquifer, while flows within the confined aquifer can get disconnected from the local drainage system due to the low conductivity of the confining layer. Lateral groundwater flows between basins are significant in the model, especially for areas with (partially) confined aquifers were long flow paths crossing catchment boundaries are simulated, thereby supporting water budgets of neighboring catchments or aquifer systems. The developed two-layer transient groundwater model is used to identify hot-spots of groundwater depletion. Global groundwater depletion is estimated as 7013\u00a0 km3 (137\u00a0 km3y\n                        \n                           \n                           \n                              \u2212\n                              1\n                           \n                        \n                     ) over 1960\u20132010, which is consistent with estimates of previous studies.", "Stationarity is undead: Uncertainty dominates the distribution of extremes ": "The increasing effort to develop and apply nonstationary models in hydrologic frequency analyses under changing environmental conditions can be frustrated when the additional uncertainty related to the model complexity is accounted for along with the sampling uncertainty. In order to show the practical implications and possible problems of using nonstationary models and provide critical guidelines, in this study we review the main tools developed in this field (such as nonstationary distribution functions, return periods, and risk of failure) highlighting advantages and disadvantages. The discussion is supported by three case studies that revise three illustrative examples reported in the scientific and technical literature referring to the Little Sugar Creek (at Charlotte, North Carolina), Red River of the North (North Dakota/Minnesota), and the Assunpink Creek (at Trenton, New Jersey). The uncertainty of the results is assessed by complementing point estimates with confidence intervals (CIs) and emphasizing critical aspects such as the subjectivity affecting the choice of the models\u2019 structure. Our results show that (1) nonstationary frequency analyses should not only be based on at-site time series but require additional information and detailed exploratory data analyses (EDA); (2) as nonstationary models imply that the time-varying model structure holds true for the entire future design life period, an appropriate modeling strategy requires that EDA identifies a well-defined deterministic mechanism leading the examined process; (3) when the model structure cannot be inferred in a deductive manner and nonstationary models are fitted by inductive inference, model structure introduces an additional source of uncertainty so that the resulting nonstationary models can provide no practical enhancement of the credibility and accuracy of the predicted extreme quantiles, whereas possible model misspecification can easily lead to physically inconsistent results; (4) when the model structure is uncertain, stationary models and a suitable assessment of the uncertainty accounting for possible temporal persistence should be retained as more theoretically coherent and reliable options for practical applications in real-world design and management problems; (5) a clear understanding of the actual probabilistic meaning of stationary and nonstationary return periods and risk of failure is required for a correct risk assessment and communication.", "A generalized framework for process-informed nonstationary extreme value analysis ": "Evolving climate conditions and anthropogenic factors, such as CO2 emissions, urbanization and population growth, can cause changes in weather and climate extremes. Most current risk assessment models rely on the assumption of stationarity (i.e., no temporal change in statistics of extremes). Most nonstationary modeling studies focus primarily on changes in extremes over time. Here, we present Process-informed Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis (ProNEVA) as a generalized tool for incorporating different types of physical drivers (i.e., underlying processes), stationary and nonstationary concepts, and extreme value analysis methods (i.e., annual maxima, peak-over-threshold). ProNEVA builds upon a newly-developed hybrid evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for numerical parameters estimation and uncertainty assessment. This offers more robust uncertainty estimates of return periods of climatic extremes under both stationary and nonstationary assumptions. ProNEVA is designed as a generalized tool allowing using different types of data and nonstationarity concepts physically-based or purely statistical) into account. In this paper, we show a wide range of applications describing changes in: annual maxima river discharge in response to urbanization, annual maxima sea levels over time, annual maxima temperatures in response to CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, and precipitation with a peak-over-threshold approach. ProNEVA is freely available to the public and includes a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance its implementation.", "Multiscale modelling of dual-porosity porous media; a computational pore-scale study for flow and solute transport ": "Many environmental and agricultural applications involve the transport of water and dissolved constituents through aggregated soil profiles, or porous media that are structured, fractured or macroporous in other ways. During the past several decades, various process-based macroscopic models have been used to simulate contaminant transport in such media. Many of these models consider advective-dispersive transport through relatively large inter-aggregate pore domains, while exchange with the smaller intra-aggregate pores is assumed to be controlled by diffusion. Exchange of solute between the two domains is often represented using a first-order mass transfer coefficient, which is commonly obtained by fitting to observed data. This study aims to understand and quantify the solute exchange term by applying a dual-porosity pore-scale network model to relatively large domains, and analysing the pore-scale results in terms of the classical dual-porosity (mobile-immobile) transport formulation.\n                  We examined the effects of key parameters (notably aggregate porosity and aggregate permeability) on the main dual-porosity model parameters, i.e., the mobile water fraction (\u03d5m\n                     ) and the mass transfer coefficient (\u03b1). Results were obtained for a wide range of aggregate porosities (between 0.082 and 0.700). The effect of aggregate permeability was explored by varying pore throat sizes within the aggregates. Solute breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained with the pore-scale network model at several locations along the domain were analysed using analytical solutions of the dual-porosity model to obtain estimates of \u03d5m\n                      and \u03b1. An increase in aggregate porosity was found to decrease \u03d5m\n                      and increase \u03b1, leading to considerable tailing in the BTCs. Changes in the aggregate pore throat size affected the relative flow velocity between the intra- and inter-aggregate domains. Higher flow velocities within the aggregates caused a change in the transport regime from diffusion dominated to more advection dominated. This change increased the exchange rate of solutes between the mobile and immobile domains, with a related increase in the value of the mass transfer coefficient and less tailing in the BTCs.", "\n               In situ characterization of immiscible three-phase flow at the pore scale for a water-wet carbonate rock ": "X-ray micro-tomography is used to image the pore-scale configurations of fluid in a rock saturated with three phases - brine, oil and gas - mimicking a subsurface reservoir, at high pressure and temperature. We determine pore occupancy during a displacement sequence that involves waterflooding, gas injection and water re-injection. In the water-wet sample considered, brine occupied the smallest pores, gas the biggest, while oil occupied pores of intermediate size and is displaced by both water and gas. Double displacement events have been observed, where gas displaces oil that displaces water or vice versa. The thickness of water and oil layers have been quantified, as have the contact angles between gas and oil, and oil and water. These results are used to explain the nature of trapping in three-phase flow, specifically how oil preferentially traps gas in the presence of water.", "Sustainable development in cities: Studying the relationship between groundwater level and urbanization using remote sensing data ": "Sustainable urban development has been one of the main concerns for policy-makers and increasing rate of population and urbanization have resulted in several socio-environmental impacts on people. Hence, water resources management in cities, as one of the most vital strategies, has become more complicated and challenging. In this study, the impact of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater level fluctuations was assessed. Using remote sensing data from different satellites and missions, data of water storage mass, precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, land cover etc. was extracted and processed by employing different programming languages and mapping tools. Atlanta metro area in Georgia, USA was selected as the case study location and the potential impacts of urban development in this city on groundwater resources were studied. The results suggest that from 2001 to 2013, limited urban development has happened in Atlanta; while this urbanization rate was more intense during previous decades and is predicted to be increased by 2050. Therefore, although other land cover types may be more correlated, results of correlating groundwater level with urban land cover is inconclusive for Atlanta metro area. Nonetheless, since relationship between urbanization and GW level variations is undeniable, novel methodology of this study can be employed for other fast-growing cities, especially in China and India.", "Occurrence and fate of emerging contaminants in water environment: A review ": "Emerging contaminants (ECs), such as personal care products (PCPs), endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), pharmaceuticals (PhACs) and their transformation products,whose occurrence at trace levels in treated wastewater is of concern for human health and the aquatic ecosystem. Due to the relatively new introduction or detection of these pollutants, there exists a gap in the knowledge on their fate, behaviors and effects, as well as on treatment technologies for their efficient removal. Furthermore, despite the advances in treatment technologies, the design of existing treatment plants are not suited to remove these ECs, in addition to there being a lack of published health standards that provide guideline in treating these pollutants. Many new ECs are being introduced into the environment without detection. In these context, this paper reviews existing research that provide reliable and quantitative information on pharmaceuticals, PCPs and EDCs and their concentrations in surface water, ground water, drinking water and treated wastewater and the removal efficiency of different treatment processes for different emerging pollutants, with a focus on recent studies regarding the fate and behavior of the contaminants in wastewater treatment plants and in the environment as well. The paper also highlights various biological and chemical treatment techniques and their drawbacks. Also, this review discusses the scope of future research on ECs.", "Assessment of groundwater quality and remediation in karst aquifers: A review ": "Karst aquifers, capable of storing and transmitting large amount of water, are the main source of drinking water in many regions worldwide. Their excessive permeability leads to an enhanced vulnerability to retain and spread the contamination accordingly. From sustainability perspective, the environmental, economic and social impacts of karst contamination on water resources management are gaining more attention. In this study, an overview of hydrogeological processes and concepts regarding groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karstic systems is presented, followed by a short discussion on surface water and groundwater interaction. Due to the complexity of karstic systems, different approaches have been developed by researchers for investigating and understanding hydrogeological processes and groundwater behavior in karst which are reviewed herein. Additionally, groundwater contamination issues and the most common and effective remediation techniques in karstic terrains are discussed. Lastly, modeling techniques and remote sensing methods, as beneficial and powerful tools for assessing groundwater flow and contaminant transport in karst terrains, are reviewed and evaluated. In each section, relevant research works conducted for Puerto Rico are discussed and some recommendations are presented to complement the ongoing hydrogeological investigations on this island.", "Geospatial and multivariate analysis of trace metals in tubewell water using for drinking purpose in the upper Gangetic basin, India: Heavy metal pollution index ": "Groundwater samples via tubewells were collected from the district Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh (India). The study aimed to analyse groundwater quality and potential sources of trace metal contamination using the multivariate statistical tool, and the level of contamination by applying contamination index (Cd) and heavy metal pollution index (HPI). The groundwater was found to be enriched with Fe and contaminated with the trace and toxic elements like Al, As, B, Cu, Mn and Pb having mean values of 2786, 152, 9, 1033, 107, 199 and 15\u202f\u00b5L respectively. Arsenic exceeded the\u00a0WHO (2011) guidelines and BIS (2012) standard (10\u202f\u00b5g/L) for 30% of the groundwater samples. For B, 46% of the samples were found having concentration higher than BIS (2012) permissible limit (1000\u202f\u00b5g/L) and 3% to WHO (2011) guideline values (2400\u202f\u00b5L). Lead level exceeded the BIS (2012) standard value and WHO (2011) guideline value in 46% of the samples. Multivariate analysis identified three factors responsible for data composition explaining 81% of the total variance in groundwater samples. Factor analysis (PCA and CA) allowed grouping of parameters according to the common features; Fe, Mn and Pb were associated with PC1 and controlled by the mixed origin such as geogenic sources as well as anthropogenic activities. Boron and Cu (PC2) were controlled by anthropogenic activities while As (PC3) was derived from the geogenic sources. The northern part of study area has higher Pb and Mn concentration than the southern part associated with small industrial activities. Degree of contamination and heavy metal pollution index supported the results and higher contamination was found to be in the vicinity of industrial setups. The overall quality (estimated using HPI values) of groundwater in the northern area is poor, and may cause potential health risk from the analyzed tubewells to the local population if the water is consumed for longer time.", "Quality and health risk assessment of shallow groundwater aquifers within the Atankwidi basin of Ghana ": "This study has appraised groundwater suitability for drinking and irrigation, and its potential health risk to humans within the Atankwidi basin of Ghana. Twenty-six boreholes were sampled and their physicochemical and heavy metal constituents determined to evaluate the groundwater potability from water quality index computations. Chlorinity, salinity, permeability indices, sodium adsorption ratio, residual bicarbonate and magnesium hardness were also computed to assess the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation. More so, the hazard quotient, hazard index and cancer risk of analyzed heavy metals were estimated to assess their potential carcinogenic risk to human health. The results showed that four and nine samples had concentrations of As, Zn and Pb exceeding respective WHO recommended limits of 0.001\u202fmg/L, 0.006\u202fmg/L and 0.01\u202fmg/L. Fluoride levels in four samples exceeded the maximum WHO limit of 1.5\u202fmg/L whilst two samples were below the minimum limit of 0.5\u202fmg/L. Water quality indices revealed that about 80% of groundwaters were potable. Compared to adults, children were more than twice vulnerable to potential carcinogenic effects over a life-time through dermal and ingestion exposures. The groundwater was generally found to be suitable for irrigation, especially for moderate salt-tolerant crops such as maize, millet, sorghum, pepper, tomatoes, cabbage, etc. To minimize potential exposure to carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks, there should be awareness creation to stop the use of agro-chemicals for farming be avoided.", "Hydrogeochemical investigation of groundwater in Dhaka City of Bangladesh using GIS and multivariate statistical techniques ": "GIS and multivariate statistics along with the geochemical approaches were applied in this study to investigate the hydrogeochemical behavior, source apportionment of groundwater pollutants and their spatial distribution in the aquifer system of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. A total of 33 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed, in order to evaluate the geochemical constituents of groundwater. Results found that, the trends of cations and anions are Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3\n                     \u2212 > Cl\u2212 > SO4\n                     2\u2212 > NO3\n                     \u2212 respectively, and Ca2+\u2013Mg2+\u2013HCO3\n                     \u2212 is the dominant groundwater type. Except Na+, K+, Cl\u2212, F\u2212 and NO3\n                     \u2212 all others measured parameters fall within the permissible limits. However, silicate weathering was identified as the major processes of controlling the groundwater solute content. Besides, cation exchange plays a significant role, influencing the water chemistry of the aquifers. Aqueous speciation model revealed that, aquifer materials were more saturated with aragonite, calcite and dolomite, and under-saturated with halite. From regression and correlation analysis it was found that, EC, Cl\u2212 and SO4\n                     2\u2212 were correlated with each other's; which might helpful for site specific monitoring of groundwater quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were also employed to appraise the sources of contaminants, and it was explored that both natural and anthropogenic factors were influencing the groundwater quality. Groundwater was contaminated due to induced river recharge and rapid infiltration of contaminated water through the recharge areas. In this situation it is expected that, outcomes of this study will provide useful insights to planners for sustainable management of groundwater resources of this megacity.", "Potential heavy metal pollution of soil and water resources from artisanal mining in Kokoteasua, Ghana ": "Effluents and mine waste from artisanal mining in Kokoteasua, a community in Ghana, are discharged directly to the environment without prior treatment and have the potential of polluting the soil and water resources that the populace rely on for their daily water need. Therefore, this study has assessed the impact of the artisanal mining activities on the soil and water resources in the community. The method employed involved mapping the water supply points in the community and sampling the water supply points and the soil (at 20 cm and 40 cm depths) to determine their heavy metal levels (i.e. Fe, Pb, Zn, As, Mn, Cu, and Hg). The water quality was assessed using the World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline values for drinking water while pollution indices were used to evaluate the levels of soil pollution. The results, generally, indicated that groundwater in the community is potable but unsuitable for drinking in isolated locations due to high levels of As and Zn. The stream, however, recorded high levels of Mn, Fe, and pH above the acceptable WHO drinking water guidelines. Again, the study found the soil to be extremely polluted with all the measured heavy metals (except Hg) from contamination factor, enrichment factor, geo-accumulation index and pollution load index assessments. Thus, the artisanal mining needs to be regulated to protect the water resource and soil from further pollution.", "Impact of Municipal Solid Waste Landfill leachate on groundwater quality in Varanasi, India. ": "This study assesses the impact of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill leachate on its surrounding groundwater quality of village Ramna, Varanasi, India. Leachate pollution index (LPI) of landfill leachate was evaluated with their physicochemical analysis that represents the overall leachate pollution potential and hazardous nature of MSW leachate. Physicochemical analysis of groundwater quality around the landfill site does not favour to drinking and domestic purposes as per the WHO and BIS standard. A considerable amount of NO3\n                     \u2212, PO4\n                     3\u2212, Fe, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS) were found in the groundwater samples near to the landfill site especially during post-monsoon, indicating that groundwater quality is being significantly affected by leachate percolation. Factor analysis signifies positive loading of most of the toxic pollutant that presenting MSW leachate impact on groundwater quality. WQI results also revealed that most of the groundwater samples were deteriorated from good and excellent water quality in pre-monsoon to fair water quality in post monsoon near the landfill site. Groundwater flow modeling simulation also showing that increase in the hydraulic head during the post-monsoon responsible for the downward flow of leachate pollutants from the landfill site. This Study suggests an urgent need for the sanitary landfill to control and minimize the impact of MSW leachate on groundwater quality around the Raman MSW landfill site.", "Assessment of geothermal water quality for industrial and irrigation purposes in the Unai geothermal field, Gujarat, India ": "Nowadays, a spotlight on the direct manipulation of water from the geothermal fields is laid for manifold applications. This manuscript discusses the utilization of water produced from geothermal wells for irrigation and industrial purposes. In order to identify the suitability of the water for the above mentioned uses, various hydrochemical parameters were evaluated. Samples were collected from three geothermal well sites from Unai village, a prominent geothermal field situated in Navsari district, Gujarat, India. The hydrochemistry of the samples collected from hot spring (depth 30\u201345\u202fm) was studied and samples were examined by calculating different parameters. The complete study was done individually for both industrial and irrigational uses of geothermal water. The mean surface temperature of the water is 55\u202f\u00b0C and average pH of the sample studied is 8.12. The key Water Quality Indices (WQI) such as Langelier Saturation Index (LSI), Ryznar Stability Index (RSI), Puckorius Scaling Index (PSI) and Larson-Skold Index (LS) were examined for industrial utilization and the key indices like Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR), Sodium Percentage (SP), Kelly Ratio (KR) Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) and Permeability Index (PI) were examined for irrigational utilization of geothermal water. LSI and RSI values show that carbonate and bicarbonate concentration is in the desirable range, however, LS (15.09, 13.54) is very high which indicates higher Cl- content. High value of indices such as SAR, KR, and SP points out the increased concentration of Na+ in the water sample. The results of this study would help the end users to identify the necessary water-treatments before utilizing the water for industrial and irrigation purposes in the study area.", "Ion exchanges process for calcium, magnesium and total hardness from ground water with natural zeolite ": "Presence of hardness ions in the municipal drinking water is the major health concern. So to minimize the hardness of drinking water up to the environmental protection authority (EPA) quality standard expensive treatments are available. This directly affects the rural and low community society. The aim of this research work is to remove the calcium, magnesium and total hardness from the municipal drinking water supply with natural zeolite. All the experiments on the research work were carried out in batch method. The experimental result illustrates that at 2M NaCl and 60\u202f\u00b0C activation temperature is suitable to achieved maximum 80.2% calcium, 84.8% magnesium and 81.0% total hardness at optimum condition pH 6.9, dose 50\u202fg/L, particle size 1\u202fmm, treatment time 30\u202fmin and experimental temperature 25\u202f\u00b0C. Regeneration of zeolite at 3M NaCl and 90\u202f\u00b0C is appropriate to achieve 80.0% total hardness, 79.9% Ca ions, 85.6% Mg ion at pH 6.9, size 1\u202fmm and regeneration time 15\u202fmin. The X-ray diffraction, scanning electron micrograph and Fourier infrared transfer analysis confirms that zeolite has participated on hardness removal. Overall zeolite is highly efficient for hardness removal and can be employed in the drinking water treatment plant.", "Modeling groundwater level fluctuations in Tehran aquifer: Results from a 3D unconfined aquifer model ": "Heavy groundwater withdrawal results in aquifer compaction and increases the risk of land subsidence hazard with significant economic, environmental, and social consequences. Having an accurate model for hydraulic pressure loss and groundwater level changes is one of the crucial factors in proper modeling and evaluation of land subsidence hazard. This paper investigates dynamics of groundwater variations in Tehran aquifer. By analyzing a comprehensive geological and hydrological data such as alluvium depths, hydraulic conductivity, piezometric measurements, and pumping well information, we model the hydraulic heads and evaluate the hydraulic conductivity. For validation of the model, groundwater level changes resulting from the model are compared with piezometric measurements for the period 2006\u20132011. The comparison shows a good consistency between the predicted and observed hydraulic head values with the maximum absolute error of less than 7\u202fm and RMS error of about 5\u202fm, that is about 2% error, considering that the hydraulic head values are between 850 and 1250\u202fm. This shows the capability and accuracy of the proposed model to simulate and predict the aquifer hydraulic head distribution and its changes. The model also indicates high hydraulic conductivity in the northern and central parts of Tehran Plain, which is attributed to the river sedimentation there.", "Environmental risk assessment of coal fly ash on soil and groundwater quality, Aligarh, India ": "An open and indiscriminate disposal of coal fly ash causes extensive changes in physicochemical properties of soil and water. Few studies propose that coal fly ash is a potential soil ameliorant that may improve the physical, chemical, biological properties, and nutritional quality of the agricultural soil. However, several recent studies documented that incorporation of higher dosages of coal fly ash into water and soil releases toxic elements consequently creating soil and groundwater pollution leading to major health, environmental, and land use problems. To assess the environmental impact of hazardous coal fly ash on the ecological system, physicochemical and hydrogeochemical analysis of both soil and groundwater are performed. X-ray diffractograms (XRD) of soils from agricultural and landfill sites (n = 8) along with coal fly ash (n = 2) show the presence of characteristic minerals of coal fly ash and also toxic arsenic mineral phases suggesting the strong influence of hazardous coal fly ash on agricultural soil. The hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater samples (n = 27) are analyzed which show elevated concentrations of most of the major ions corresponding to higher values than maximum permissible levels of recommended drinking water standards by World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The water quality indices (WQI) suggests poor to unsuitable water for drinking. Conversely, evaluation of various other hydrochemical indices calculated using elemental concentration of the groundwater samples demarcates contamination of water due to the open dumping of coal fly ash and therefore not desirable for drinking purposes.", "Synthesis of bone char from cattle bones and its application for fluoride removal from the contaminated water ": "This study is focused on the synthesis of bone char (BC) and its application in adsorptive removal of fluoride from the water. The BC was synthesized by the thermal pyrolysis of used cattle bones. In preliminary stage, BC was synthesized at different temperatures ranging from 350 to 700\u202f\u00b0C and due to the higher surface area and adsorption capacity, BC synthesized at 350\u202f\u00b0C was selected for further experiments. The XRD pattern of BC found better in agreement with the standard pattern of hydroxyapatite. FTIR analysis also signified basic spectra of hydroxyapatite with specific bands at wavelength of 3429, 1639, 1453, 1037, 604 and 566\u202fcm\u22121. Typical agglomerated structure of hydroxyapatite was witnessed in morphological examination with SEM. The specific surface area, total pore volume and the average pore diameter were found 79.34\u202fm2 g\u22121, 0.041\u202fcm3 g\u22121 and 2.09\u202fnm, respectively. The elemental chemical analysis revealed 1.71 Ca/P ratio. About 10.56\u202fmg of fluoride was adsorbed on 1\u202fg of BC. The adsorption isotherm data was briefly illustrated by applying Langmuir isotherm model and Freundlich isotherm model. In conclusion, BC is successfully synthesized and the highest fluoride adsorption capacity was achieved as compared with earlier studies.", "Groundwater governance in Bangladesh: Established practices and recent trends ": "Legal framework is very crucial to protect the vital resources, to provide rights to public and administration, to support national policy and to bring technological intervention to ensure equitable distribution, fair management, and effective decision making. In Bangladesh, groundwater is not directly priced (other than pumping costs), perhaps such issue is not surprising that users do not meter the volumes of water usage. Beside the industry, agricultural sector is by far the biggest groundwater consumer of this country, contributing significant amount of annual meter drop in the groundwater table to the annual decline of groundwater table. Additionally, the groundwater resources are severely affected by, pollution, encroachment and overexploitation. National Water Policy (1999) and Bangladesh Water Act (2013) are considered as country's pivotal legal framework but both of these lag behind to provide effective guidelines on permission, extraction limit, monitoring, protection of quality, water harvesting procedure, and recharge mechanism. Existing institutions suffer from consistent crisis, politics, corruption, absence of public participation and coordination of other institutions, mismanagement, and empirical assessment. This study evaluates the existing water related policies and functions of multidimensional institutions, and discusses the key challenges of effective groundwater management. The present paper also provides an overview of established practices around the world to cope with the common challenges.", "Groundwater potentiality study in drought prone barind tract, NW Bangladesh using remote sensing and GIS ": "Present study is carried out in the drought prone Barind tract in the north-western part of Bangladesh to identify zones of groundwater potentiality using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) based geospatial multi-criteria approach. Decreasing rainfall trend along with increasing demand for groundwater irrigation of this agro-based area utters urgent need for sustainable groundwater resource development. The study area possesses sub-dendritic drainage pattern with highly irregular to irregular geomorphological character with mostly flat to gentle slope represents 'not so good category' for groundwater development because of lower rainfall with less favorable infiltration capacity of top soil with respect to time of percolation of runoff. Here major portion of runoff water loses and not allows more infiltration to recharge the groundwater and, therefore is less potential for groundwater occurrence and development. To delineate groundwater potentiality, thematic layers like geomorphology, drainage density, rainfall, lithology, lineament density, slope and land use/land cover (LULC) have taken into consideration to integrate in the GIS environment, and has categorized as: 4% (48\u202fkm2) - very good, 13% (170\u202fkm2) - good; 25% (342\u202fkm2) - moderate; 30% (405\u202fkm2) - poor; and 28% (365\u202fkm2) as very poor category. On the other hand, this potential zonation is most sensitive to lithology; followed by slope and lineament density; and succeeded by geomorphology, drainage density, rainfall, and LULC. This study helps not only to classify zones of groundwater resource potentiality, but also to assess groundwater resource potentiality and scopes for its future development at a glance and provides a guideline for the groundwater resource management approach particularly in the area.", "Comprehensive investigation of groundwater quality in the north-west of Iran: Physicochemical and heavy metal analysis ": "The suitability of rural groundwater quality for drinking purposes were investigated in the north west of Iran. Major anions, cations and heavy metals were measured in 39 water wells during the summer and spring seasons. The spatial distribution of major parameters and hydro-chemical faces were described by developing GIS-based maps and Piper and Gibbs diagrams. According to the results, the EC values were in the range of 461 and 2600\u202f\u03bcs/cm with the hardness contents between 220 and 720\u202fmg/L as CaCO3. It was found that, the total hardness is highly correlated with the magnesium concentration than calcium in all samples. The dominant cations and anions were in the order of Mg2+ > Na+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3\n                     - > SO4\n                     2- > Cl- > NO3\n                     - > F-, respectively. The major water types in the area were fresh (Ca-HCO3) and saline (Ca-Mg-Cl). Based on Gibbs plot, the main mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry were rainfall dominance, rock weathering dominance, and evaporation-participation dominance. The lower quality of water resources sited in the southern and northern parts of the area was observed according to the GIS maps. It was found that aluminum, boron, iron and manganese concentrations, in some cases, were higher than the guideline values however, it can be concluded that groundwater quality in the study area, apart from some cases, is suitable for drinking purposes without any specific treatment processes. The present study gives a comprehensive status of groundwater quality for proper management in the area.", "Potential for aquifer contamination of anthropogenic activity in the recharge area of the Guarani Aquifer System, southeast of Brazil ": "Understanding the response of physical environment to anthropogenic activities assists land use planning aimed at protecting water resources, which prevents society from incurring major economic and social costs. This paper aimed to identify the potential contamination of groundwater by human activity at an outcropping area of Guarani Aquifer System (GAS), the most important hydrogeological unit in South America. The methodology used was based on a multi-criteria analysis using decision matrices to analyze, from algebra mapping in a GIS environment, the influence of rock units, aquifer units, soil classes, steepness, slope shape, and land cover and use in contamination potential. Overall, medium to very high potential for groundwater contamination predominates in the area, amounting to 69.23%. In such areas, when the absence of federal or state law which defines the areas of protection for recharge, the master plans of the municipalities located in the GAS outcropping regions play an important role in complementing the legislation. S\u00e3o Carlos, has its own legislation that aims to control land use in areas of springs, and thereby to protect them. However, the GAS recharge areas near the surface are not contemplated, and specific regulation and standards for deployment of human activity in these areas, have not been established. Therefore, it is suggested that territorial planning to be carried out on a more refined scale. Given that the natural conditions and anthropogenic activities performed in the area of study are reflected in many other periurban wellheads, as well as that of the Guarani Aquifer outcropping are, the decision matrices designed can be applied and serve as an agile tool to define the recharge areas to be protected on a preliminary basis.", "Arsenic concentration in groundwater: Archetypal study from South Africa ": "South Africa does not have significant surface water resources, which is often easily affected by unpredictable and rapidly changing climatic variables, due to its location in the arid and semi-arid climatic setting. In large part of the country, groundwater from weathered and fractured crystalline rocks plays pivotal role in sustaining the livelihood, often it contains toxic metals released from the host rocks. The host rocks that are responsible for arsenic release in groundwater are primarily enriched due to metamorphism and igneous processes that resulted in the enrichment of economic minerals. Preliminary assessment indicates that the main arsenic containing minerals are arsenopyrite (FeAsS), arsenical oxide, sulpharsenide, arsenopyritical reefs, leucopyrite, l\u00f6llingite (FeAs2) and scorodite (FeAsO4\u00b72H2O). Owing to the release of arsenic from highly mineralized rocks that constitute the aquifers, arsenic concentration in the groundwater reaches up to 253\u202f\u03bcg/L (Namaqualand), 6150\u202f\u03bcg/L (west of Johannesburg), about 500\u202f\u03bcg/L in the Karoo aquifers, considerably higher than the WHO guideline value of 10\u202f\u03bcg/L. Acid mine drainage from coal and gold mining is also found to be an important source of arsenic and other toxic metals in groundwater.", "Groundwater quality and vulnerability assessment in west Luxor Governorate, Egypt ": "Groundwater is the main source of water for different purposes in the desert areas of Egypt. The agricultural and different human activities in line with hydrological characteristics have influenced the quality of this water resource. The main aim of this work was the determination of groundwater quality and vulnerability to pollution in west Luxor Governorate, Egypt. For completion of this work, 50 boreholes were sampled during October 2014 and groundwater samples were analyzed chemically. Hydrological, topographic, lithological, climatic conditions and land use data, which considered key factors for pollutants transport, were also collected for building groundwater vulnerability maps. The results revealed high levels of groundwater pollution with NO3\u00af, Cd and Pb, as well as increased levels of total dissolved solids. The map of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability (based on the IV index; Arauzo 2017) showed medium and high levels of vulnerability associated with natural factors in 62% and 38% of the area, respectively. The map of specific groundwater vulnerability (based on the LU-IV procedure; Arauzo 2017) indicated that 52% of the area showed high to extreme levels of vulnerability to nitrate pollution from nonpoint sources. From this, it was concluded that the study area can be considered as Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) and, therefore, specific measures (including optimization of water and N-fertilizers applications) must be taken in order to restore water quality.", "Assessment of groundwater quality for irrigation of green spaces in the Rourkela city of Odisha, India ": "For the health of the city dwellers the development of green spaces is imperative. Sustenance of such green spaces is directly controlled by the water quality. Steel City Rourkela in Odisha State of India, lying between 84.54\u00b0E longitude and 22.12\u00b0N latitude, has green spaces whose existence depends on the groundwater quality. The quality of 25 groundwater samples in the Rourkela city was evaluated for examining their suitability for irrigation purpose in order to sustain green spaces in the city. The assessment was completed using pH, Electrical Conductivity, Total Hardness, Sodium Absorption Ratio, Na %, Residual Soluble Carbonate, Residual Sodium Bicarbonate, Permeability index, Potential Salinity, Magnesium hazard, Magnesium/Calcium ratio, Kelley's ratio and indices of base exchange. Data plot dispositions on Gibb's diagram indicated that the chemistry of groundwater of the area is controlled by rock composition. Most of the samples with negative chloro-alkaline indices values suggested the predominance of chloro-alkaline disequilibrium process in the groundwater system. Data plot disposition on U.S. Salinity hazard diagram indicates that 11 and 14 samples belong to C2S1 and C1S1, illustrating medium salinity/low sodium type and low salinity/low sodium type, respectively. There was difference in the groundwater samples from Urban, Rurban and Rural setup of the region with respect to some parameters/indices. The spatial variability of the physico-chemical parameters suggests that the groundwater of Chhend colony, Civil Township, Sector 21, Uditnagar and Bandamunda are most suitable for irrigation, in contrast to that of Koel Nagar, Shaktinagar, Basanti Colony and northwest part of Jagda-Jhirpani area. With the surface water scarcity in the region the groundwater at some sites of the city can be used for maintenance of green spaces.", "Comparison among influencing factor, frequency ratio, and analytical hierarchy process techniques for groundwater potential zonation in Vaitarna basin, Maharashtra, India ": "Groundwater is a hidden natural resource which plays a crucial role in all the environmental and biological processes with a greater significance on socio-economic activities. However, the nature of groundwater is dynamic and highly variable from place to place. Therefore, for sustainable development and management, accurate location based groundwater potential mapping is critical in arid and semi-arid regions. This study demonstrates the proficiency of three decision making approaches, viz., influencing factors (IF), frequency ratio (FR), and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques in groundwater potentiality mapping. A total eight parameters such as lithology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density, land-use, lineament density, rainfall, soil texture, and soil depth are assessed through satellite and conventional data sources. Weights are assigned to all these parameters and their sub parameters to perform influencing factor and AHP models, based on existing knowledge. Frequency ratio is performed by calculation of the ratio between the number of wells availability on a category to the total area of each factor. Three resultant maps are prepared by integrating all these parameters and their corresponding weights in GIS environment. The validation results exhibit that the map produced using FR model is more efficient (75% accuracy) compared to the IF (71% accuracy) and AHP techniques (70% accuracy). Based on this study it is concluded that the frequency ratio model is more reliable for the assessment of groundwater potential. However, the groundwater potential maps prepared in this study will be helpful for effective planning and groundwater management in Vaitarna basin.", "Groundwater as a social-ecological system: A framework for managing groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States ": "Groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States is a critical source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities. Groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations, climate change and climate variability. Many groundwater systems in the region have been inappropriately managed, with increasing occurrences of groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion. This limits the availability of freshwater, increases the likelihood of contracting water borne diseases, and the cost of access to alternative freshwater sources. In this paper, we argue that groundwater systems are social-ecological systems, where anthropogenic activities and groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic, non-linear processes. We also argue that groundwater management failures in the region, are associated with traditional command and control approaches to management, which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and ecological groundwater systems; and assumes that groundwater resources, and the dependant human communities can be managed independently. Recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant social communities is important for the long-term sustainability of groundwater in these regions. Conceptual frameworks are useful tools to order phenomena and material, revealing patterns and processes, and enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single conceptual-empirical structure. We propose a framework to manage groundwater as a social-ecological system. The framework is comprised of three building blocks: complex adaptive systems, resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management. We discuss how the application of the framework in the Republic of Nauru may alter decades of groundwater mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path.", "Water as key to the sustainable development goals of South Sudan \u2013 A water quality assessment of Eastern Equatoria State ": "South Sudan, the world's newest nation is bestowed with huge fresh water resources. However, water resources management in South Sudan is lacking in water quality monitoring data and comprehensive plans of action for sustainable water resources development.\n                  Groundwater resources in particular have been exploited for domestic and irrigation use versus surface water. However, this groundwater withdrawal has not been monitored for its level and quality. To overcome this deficit, groundwater major ion chemistry in the South Sudan's Eastern Equatoria State was evaluated to determine its suitability for drinking, domestic, and irrigation purposes. A total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during wet (October 2014) and dry (April 2014) seasons. Sampling points were spread around the eight counties of Eastern Equatoria. Twenty two water samples were collected from each county. The samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters including alkalinity, calcium hardness, conductivity, pH, salinity, TDS, total hardness, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, CrT, Cd2+, Cu2+, FeT, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, NO3\n                     -, Cl-, F-, SO4\n                     2-, PO4\n                     3-, and SiO2. Groundwater irrigation quality indices including chlorinity index, Kelli Index, magnesium ratio, percentage of sodium must be replaced by sodium percentage (%Na), permeability index (PI), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), salinity index, sodicity index, and sodium absorption ratio (SAR), were calculated to determine the groundwater suitability for agricultural uses. The results were compared with South Sudan water quality guidelines (SSWQGs) and the WHO standards. Most of the water quality parameters met the WHO standards and SSWQGs prescribed for drinking and domestic purposes. The calculated irrigation water quality indices indicated the water suitability for irrigation.", "A Customized FuzzyAHP - GIS based DRASTIC-L model for intrinsic groundwater vulnerability assessment of urban and peri urban phreatic aquifer clusters ": "The groundwater vulnerability analysis addresses the degree of sensitivity of groundwater system towards changes in both intrinsic/inherent and extrinsic factors. With this aim, an integrated FAHP-GIS-based modified DRASTIC (DRASTIC-L) method was followed in order to address the response of various hydro-geological indicators towards attenuation of pollutant to sub-surface hydrological regime in two differently urbanized clusters of Kozhikode district in Kerala, Southern India. Rating for the DRASTIC-L factors was derived with the aid of Fuzzy based Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP). Spatial and non-spatial information was integrated into a GIS environment. The resultant spatial data thus generated depicted that about 71% of urban and 22% of peri-urban zones of the study area, which are characterised by porous and permeable vadose media with shallow groundwater table, have a high to very high vulnerability index value. Majority of highly vulnerable urban area extends 0\u201310\u202fkm from the coastal line and has a dense population. Of the total study area, 8% urban and 38.5% of peri-urban area with low index value indicated that the groundwater in the zone is protected from contaminant's leaching due to its inherent hydrogeology. Low porous vadose media and the presence of steep slope terrain favors this low vulnerability. Besides the remaining area shows moderate vulnerability to contamination. Single - parameter and map-removal sensitivity analyses highlighted that vadose zone characteristic has the highest influence on vulnerability assessment. The resultant vulnerability index values validated with composite groundwater quality index data depicted the significant correlation among them. Thus, the groundwater vulnerability index map is an efficient tool for water-sensitive urban development.", "Hydrogeochemical characteristics with respect to fluoride contamination in groundwater of Maheshwarm mandal, RR district, Telangana state, India ": "Groundwater samples were collected in Maheshwaram mandal, Ranga Reddy district, Telangana State, India for two seasons (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon) and analyzed for chemical parameters with respect to fluoride. The fluoride concentration ranges from 0.31 to 3.03\u202fmg/l and 0.28\u20132.58\u202fmg/l during pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) seasons respectively. Results showed that water samples were contaminated with presence of fluoride ion. High fluoride concentration recorded during PRM 62% and POM 38% when compared with World Health Organization tolerance limit of 1.5\u202fmg/l. The higher ratio of Na/Ca indicates dissolution of fluoride minerals at higher pH and the HCO3/Ca ratio indicate the condition favoring to dissolution of fluoride ions. Hydrogeochemical facies distribution indicates water-rock interaction resulted in occurrence of high fluoride concentration in groundwater. Analytical results plotted on Gibb's diagram indicate rock and evaporation dominance. Principal component analysis indicates hydrogeochemical processes like weathering, ion exchange, and anthropogenic activities contribute to groundwater chemistry.", "Common effluent treatment plant (CETP): Reliability analysis and performance evaluation ": "Common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) have been installed and are in operation at numerous industrial clusters throughout India. They serve to reduce effluent treatment cost, provide better collective treatment, and reduce land cost for small-scale industrial facilities that cannot afford individual treatment plants. Optimum working conditions for treatment of effluent to be at par with discharge standards is a major mandate for any CETP. In this study, the reliability and removal efficiencies (REs) of a CETP in the industrial area of Maharashtra State in India were examined. An established methodology was adopted to determine the effectiveness of the CETP in terms of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease (O&G) concentrations. The CETP's compliance with respect to design standards and its operation were studied in detail. This paper highlights the results of RE and the coefficient of determination (R\n                     2) values obtained from the CETP data, estimates the pollutants removed at the highest and lowest rates over a period of time, and highlights the reasons for problem areas along with remedial measures. It was observed that, except O&G, all the parameters (BOD, COD, and TSS) showed fluctuations in removal efficiencies and their reliabilities. This situation can be improved by releasing effluent containing hydraulic and organic loading to the CETP as per standards and optimizing treatment processes, especially primary clari-flocculators and aeration tanks, both of which are important units of any CETP.", "A simple formula for predicting settling velocity of sediment particles ": "Based on the general relationship described by Cheng between the drag coefficient and the Reynolds number of a particle, a new relationship between the Reynolds number and a dimensionless particle parameter is proposed. Using a trial-and-error procedure to minimize errors, the coefficients were determined and a formula was developed for predicting the settling velocity of natural sediment particles. This formula has higher prediction accuracy than other published formulas and it is applicable to all Reynolds numbers less than 2\u00d7105.", "Performance assessment of two-dimensional hydraulic models for generation of flood inundation maps in mountain river basins ": "Hydraulic models for the generation of flood inundation maps are not commonly applied in mountain river basins because of the difficulty in modeling the hydraulic behavior and the complex topography. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of four two-dimensional hydraulic models (HEC-RAS 2D, Iber 2D, Flood Modeller 2D, and PCSWMM 2D) with respect to the generation of flood inundation maps. The study area covers a 5-km reach of the Santa B\u00e1rbara River located in the Ecuadorian Andes, at 2330 masl, in Gualaceo. The model's performance was evaluated based on the water surface elevation and flood extent, in terms of the mean absolute difference and measure of fit. The analysis revealed that, for a given case, Iber 2D has the best performance in simulating the water level and inundation for flood events with 20- and 50-year return periods, respectively, followed by Flood Modeller 2D, HEC-RAS 2D, and PCSWMM 2D in terms of their performance. Grid resolution, the way in which hydraulic structures are mimicked, the model code, and the default value of the parameters are considered the main sources of prediction uncertainty.", "Experimental and numerical analysis of flow over a rectangular full-width sharp-crested weir ": "Weirs are a type of hydraulic structure, used for water level adjustment, flow measurement, and diversion of water in irrigation systems. In this study, experiments were conducted on sharp-crested weirs under free-flow conditions and an optimization method was used to determine the best form of the discharge coefficient equation based on the coefficient of determination (R\n                     2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The ability of the numerical method to simulate the flow over the weir was also investigated using Fluent software. Results showed that, with an increase of the ratio of the head over the weir crest to the weir height (h/P), the discharge coefficient decreased nonlinearly and reached a constant value of 0.7 for h/P\u00a0>\u00a00.6. The best form of the discharge coefficient equation predicted the discharge coefficient well and percent errors were within a \u00b15% error limit. Numerical results of the discharge coefficient showed strong agreement with the experimental data. Variation of the discharge coefficient with Reynolds numbers showed that the discharge coefficient reached a constant value of 0.7 when h/P\u00a0>\u00a00.6 and Re\u00a0>\u00a020000.", "Correlations between silt density index, turbidity and oxidation-reduction potential parameters in seawater reverse osmosis desalination ": "The reverse osmosis method is one of the most widely used methods of seawater desalination at present. Hydrophilic and desalting membranes in reverse osmosis systems are highly susceptible to the input pollutants. Various contaminants, including suspended organic and inorganic matter, result in membrane fouling and membrane degradation. Fundamental parameters such as the turbidity, the amount of chlorine injection, and silt density index (SDI) are the most predominant parameters of fouling control in the membranes. In this study, the operation system included a water intake unit, a pretreatment system, and an RO system. The pretreatment system encompassed a clarifier, a gravity sand filter, pressurized sand filters, and a cartridge filter. The correlation between the amount of chlorine injection in terms of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and the SDI value of the input water was investigated at a specified site next to the Persian Gulf. The results showed that, at certain intervals of inlet turbidity, injection of a certain amount of chlorine into the raw water has a distinct effect on the decrease of SDI.", "Using multi-satellite microwave remote sensing observations for retrieval of daily surface soil moisture across China ": "The objective of this study was to retrieve daily composite soil moisture by jointly using brightness temperature observations from multiple operating satellites for near real-time application with better coverage and higher accuracy. Our approach was to first apply the single-channel brightness radiometric algorithm to estimate soil moisture from the respective brightness temperature observations of the SMAP, SMOS, AMSR2, FY3B, and FY3C satellites on the same day and then produce a daily composite dataset by averaging the individual satellite-retrieved soil moisture. We further evaluated our product, the official soil moisture products of the five satellites, and the ensemble mean (i.e., arithmetic mean) of the five official satellite soil moisture products against ground observations from two networks in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, China. The results show that our product outperforms the individual released products of the five satellites and their ensemble means in the two validation areas. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of our product were 0.06 and 0.09\u00a0m3/m3 in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. Relative to the ensemble mean of the five satellite products, our product improves the accuracy by 9.1% and 57.7% in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. This demonstrates that jointly using brightness temperature observations from multiple satellites to retrieve soil moisture not only improves the spatial coverage of daily observations but also produces better daily composite products.", "Evaluation of copper removal efficiency using water treatment sludge ": "Large quantities of sludge are produced during water treatment processes. Recently, sludge has been treated as waste and disposed of in landfills, which increases the environmental burdens and the operational cost. Therefore, sludge reuse has become a significant environmental issue. In this study, adsorption of copper ions (Cu2+) onto calcined sludge was investigated under various operational conditions (with varying temperature, Cu2+ initial concentration, pH, and sludge dosage). The prepared sludge material was characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. The sorption capacity of sludge was directly proportional to the initial Cu2+ concentration and inversely proportional to the sludge dosage. The optimum operational pH and solution temperature were 6.6 and 80\u00b0C, respectively. The experimental results followed a Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-first-order adsorption kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters such as activation energy, change in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy were calculated. Thermodynamic analyses indicated that the sorption of copper ions onto the calcined sludge was driven by a physical adsorption process. The prepared sludge was proven to be an excellent adsorbent material for the removal of Cu2+ from an aqueous solution under optimum conditions.", "River bank protection from ship-induced waves and river flow ": "A new equation is proposed for the design of armor units on protected river banks under the combined action of ship-induced waves and river flow. Existing observed field and experimental data in the literature have been examined and a valuable database has been developed. Different conditions, including the river water depth, flow velocity, river bank slope, Froude number, wave height, wave period, and wave obliquity have been considered. Results from an empirical equation (Bhowmik, 1978) that only considers the maximum wave height and river bank slope have been compared with the results calculated by the newly developed equation. Calculated results have also been verified against field data. Results show that not only the maximum wave height and river bank slope but also the water depth, flow velocity, wave length, wave obliquity, and wave period are important parameters for predicting the mean diameter of the armor units, highlighting the multivariate behavior of protecting the river bank in the presence of ship-induced waves and river flow velocity.", "Understanding groundwater table using a statistical model ": "In this study, a statistical model was established to estimate the groundwater table using precipitation, evaporation, the river stage of the Liangduo River, and the tide level of the Yellow Sea, as well as to predict the groundwater table with easily measurable climate data in a coastal plain in eastern China. To achieve these objectives, groundwater table data from twelve wells in a farmland covering an area of 50\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0m were measured over a 12-month period in 2013 in Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province. Trend analysis and correlation analysis were conducted to study the patterns of changes in the groundwater table. In addition, a linear regression model was established and regression analysis was conducted to understand the relationships between precipitation, evaporation, river stage, tide level, and groundwater table. The results are as follows: (1) The groundwater table was strongly affected by climate factors (e.g., precipitation and evaporation), and river stage was also a significant factor affecting the groundwater table in the study area (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, where p is the probability value). (2) The groundwater table was especially sensitive to precipitation. The significance of the factors of the groundwater table were ranked in the following descending order: precipitation, evaporation, and river stage. (3) A triple linear regression model of the groundwater table, precipitation, evaporation, and river stage was established. The linear relationship between the groundwater table and the main factors was satisfied by the actual values versus the simulated values of the groundwater table (R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.841, where R\n                     2 is the coefficient of determination).", "Impacts of rainfall and catchment characteristics on bioretention cell performance ": "Although many studies have evaluated the impacts of bioretention cell (BRC) design elements on hydrologic performance, few have investigated the roles played by site characteristics and rainfall patterns. The objectives of this study were to assess the impacts of rainfall and catchments with different characteristics on the hydrologic performance of BRCs and identify important factors in sizing bioretention when hydrologic performance was oriented for the design using a modeling approach. A 10-year record of rainfall data was used to identify the frequency and magnitude of rainfall events. The results showed that although the small and medium rainfall events were dominant they contributed less to the total rainfall depth than the large rainfall events. The ratio of runoff coefficient to imperviousness can be used as an indicator to explain why BRCs perform differently with the same design strategy under the same rainfall events. Rainfall patterns had significant impacts on the hydrologic performance of BRCs by influencing the overflow and underdrain flow. BRCs performed better for rainfall events with a longer duration and lower rainfall intensity because they generated smoother runoff processes into the BRCs. On the basis of these results, the runoff coefficient is suggested for BRC surface design.", "Submerged flexible vegetation impact on open channel flow velocity distribution: An analytical modelling study on drag and friction ": "In this paper, an analytical model that represents the streamwise velocity distribution for open channel flow with submerged flexible vegetation is studied. In the present vegetated flow modelling, the whole flow field has been separated into two layers vertically: a vegetated layer and a non-vegetated free-water layer. Within the vegetated layer, an analysis of the mechanisms affecting water flow through flexible vegetation has been conducted. In the non-vegetated layer, a modified log-law equation that represents the velocity profile varying with vegetation height has been investigated. Based on the studied analytical model, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess the influences of the drag (\n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 C\n                              \n                              \n                                 D\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     ) and friction (\n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 C\n                              \n                              \n                                 f\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     ) coefficients on the flow velocity.

A Harten-Lax-van Leer-contact (HLLC) approximate Riemann solver was used to evaluate fluxes. The TVD MUSCL-Hancock numerical scheme utilizes slope limiters, such as the minmod, double minmod, superbee, van Albada, and van Leer limiters, to prevent spurious oscillations and maintain monotonicity near discontinuities. A comparative study of the impact of various slope limiters on the accuracy of the numerical flow model was conducted with several dam-break examples including wet and dry bed cases. The numerical results of the superbee and double minmod limiters agree better with the theoretical solution and have higher accuracy than other limiters in one-dimensional (1D) space. The ratio of the downstream water depth to the upstream water depth was used to select the proper slope limiter. For the 2D numerical model, the superbee limiter should not be used, owing to significant numerical dispersion.", "High-resolution flood modeling of urban areas using MSN_Flood ": "Although existing hydraulic models have been used to simulate and predict urban flooding, most of these models are inadequate due to the high spatial resolution required to simulate flows in urban floodplains. Nesting high-resolution subdomains within coarser-resolution models is an efficient solution for enabling simultaneous calculation of flooding due to tides, surges, and high river flows. MSN_Flood has been developed to incorporate moving boundaries around nested domains, permitting alternate flooding and drying along the boundary and in the interior of the domain. Ghost cells adjacent to open boundary cells convert open boundaries, in effect, into internal boundaries. The moving boundary may be multi-segmented and non-continuous, with recirculating flow across the boundary. When combined with a bespoke adaptive interpolation scheme, this approach facilitates a dynamic internal boundary. Based on an alternating-direction semi-implicit finite difference scheme, MSN_Flood was used to hindcast a major flood event in Cork City resulting from the combined pressures of fluvial, tidal, and storm surge processes. The results show that the model is computationally efficient, as the 2-m high-resolution nest is used only in the urban flooded region. Elsewhere, lower-resolution nests are used. The results also show that the model is highly accurate when compared with measured data. The model is capable of incorporating nested sub-domains when the nested boundary is multi-segmented and highly complex with lateral gradients of elevation and velocities. This is a major benefit when modelling urban floodplains at very high resolution.", "Calculation of passive earth pressure of cohesive soil based on Culmann's method ": "Based on the sliding plane hypothesis of Coulumb earth pressure theory, a new method for calculation of the passive earth pressure of cohesive soil was constructed with Culmann's graphical construction. The influences of the cohesive force, adhesive force, and the fill surface form were considered in this method. In order to obtain the passive earth pressure and sliding plane angle, a program based on the sliding surface assumption was developed with the VB.NET programming language. The calculated results from this method were basically the same as those from the Rankine theory and Coulumb theory formulas. This method is conceptually clear, and the corresponding formulas given in this paper are simple and convenient for application when the fill surface form is complex.", "Computational investigation of hydraulic performance variation with geometry in gabion stepped spillways ": "Over recent years, there has been a clear increase in the frequency of reported flooding events around the world. Gabion structures offer one means of flood mitigation in dam spillways. These types of structures provide an additional challenge to the computational modeller in that flow through the porous gabions must be simulated. We have used a computational model to investigate the flow over gabion stepped spillways. The model was first validated against published experimental results. Then, gabion stepped spillways with four different step geometries were tested under the same conditions in order to facilitate inter-comparisons and to choose the best option in terms of energy dissipation. The results show that normal gabion steps can dissipate more energy than overlap, inclined, and pooled steps. An intensive set of tests with varying slope, stone size, and porosity were undertaken. The location of the inception point and the water depth at this point obtained from this study were compared with those from existing formulae. Two new empirical equations have been derived, on the basis of a regression analysis, to provide improved results for gabion stepped spillways.", "Modeling river water quality parameters using modified adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system ": "Water quality is always one of the most important factors in human health. Artificial intelligence models are respected methods for modeling water quality. The evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a new technique for improving the performance of artificial intelligence models such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Attempts have been made to make the models more suitable and accurate with the replacement of other training methods that do not suffer from some shortcomings, including a tendency to being trapped in local optima or voluminous computations. This study investigated the applicability of ANFIS with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization for continuous domains (ACOR) in estimating water quality parameters at three stations along the Zayandehrood River, in Iran. The ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-ACOR methods were also compared with the classic ANFIS method, which uses least squares and gradient descent as training algorithms. The estimated water quality parameters in this study were electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), carbonate hardness (CH), and total hardness (TH). Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS software to determine the optimal inputs to the models. The analysis showed that ANFIS-PSO was the better model compared with ANFIS-ACOR. It is noteworthy that EA models can improve ANFIS' performance at all three stations for different water quality parameters.", "Numerical simulation of flow separation over a backward-facing step with high Reynolds number ": "Large eddy simulation (LES) explicitly calculates the large-scale vortex field and parameterizes the small-scale vortices. In this study, LES and \u03ba-\u03b5 models were developed for a specific geometrical configuration of backward-facing step (BFS). The simulation results were validated with particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and direct numerical simulation (DNS). This LES simulation was carried out with a Reynolds number of 9000 in a pressurized water tunnel with an expansion ratio of 2.00. The results indicate that the LES model can reveal large-scale vortex motion although with a larger grid-cell size. However, the LES model tends to overestimate the top wall separation and the Reynolds stress components for the BFS flow simulation without a sufficiently fine grid. Overall, LES is a potential tool for simulating separated flow controlled by large-scale vortices.", "Biosorption of Ni(II) ions from aqueous solution using modified Aloe barbadensis Miller leaf powder ": "This study aimed to investigate the biosorption potential of Na2CO3-modified Aloe barbadensis Miller (Aloe vera) leaf (MABL) powder for removal of Ni(II) ions from a synthetic aqueous solution. Effects of various process parameters (pH, equilibrium time, and temperature) were investigated in order to optimize the biosorptive removal. The maximum biosorption capacity of MABL was observed to be 28.986\u00a0mg/g at a temperature of 303\u00a0K, a biosorbent dose of 0.6\u00a0g, a contact time of 90\u00a0min, and a pH value of 7. Different kinetic models (the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models) were evaluated. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to be the best fitted model in this study, with a coefficient of determination of R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.974. Five different isotherm models (the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) models) were investigated to identify the best-suited isotherm model for the present system. Based on the minimum chi-square value (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a00.027) and the maximum coefficient of determination (R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.996), the Langmuir isotherm model was found to represent the system well, indicating the possibility of monolayer biosorption. The sticking probability (S*) was found to be 0.41, suggesting a physisorption mechanism for biosorption of Ni(II) on MABL. The biosorbent was characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential, and BET surface area, in order to understand its morphological and functional characteristics.", "Stability analysis of unsaturated soil slope during rainfall infiltration using coupled liquid-gas-solid three-phase model ": "Generally, most soil slope failures are induced by rainfall infiltration, a process that involves interactions between the liquid phase, gas phase, and solid skeleton in an unsaturated soil slope. In this study, a loosely coupled liquid-gas-solid three-phase model, linking two numerical codes, TOUGH2/EOS3, which is used for water-air two-phase flow analysis, and FLAC3D, which is used for mechanical analysis, was established. The model was validated through a documented water drainage experiment over a sandy column and a comparison of the results with measured data and simulated results from other researchers. The proposed model was used to investigate the features of water-air two-phase flow and stress fields in an unsaturated soil slope during rainfall infiltration. The slope stability analysis was then performed based on the simulated water-air two-phase seepage and stress fields on a given slip surface. The results show that the safety factor for the given slip surface decreases first, then increases, and later decreases until the rainfall stops. Subsequently, a sudden rise occurs. After that, the safety factor decreases continually and reaches its lowest value, and then increases slowly to a steady value. The lowest value does not occur when the rainfall stops, indicating a delayed effect of the safety factor. The variations of the safety factor for the given slip surface are therefore caused by a combination of pore-air pressure, matric suction, normal stress, and net normal stress.", "On-site stormwater detention for Australian development projects: Does it meet frequent flow management objectives? ": "On-site stormwater detention (OSD) is a conventional component of urban drainage systems, designed with the intention of mitigating the increase to peak discharge of stormwater runoff that inevitably results from urbanization. In Australia, singular temporal patterns for design storms have governed the inputs of hydrograph generation and in turn the design process of OSD for the last three decades. This paper raises the concern that many existing OSD systems designed using the singular temporal pattern for design storms may not be achieving their stated objectives when they are assessed against a variety of alternative temporal patterns. The performance of twenty real OSD systems was investigated using two methods: (1) ensembles of design temporal patterns prescribed in the latest version of Australian Rainfall and Runoff, and (2) real recorded rainfall data taken from pluviograph stations modeled with continuous simulation. It is shown conclusively that the use of singular temporal patterns is ineffective in providing assurance that an OSD will mitigate the increase to peak discharge for all possible storm events. Ensemble analysis is shown to provide improved results. However, it also falls short of providing any guarantee in the face of naturally occurring rainfall.", "Application of HEC-HMS for flood forecasting in Misai and Wan'an catchments in China ": "The hydrologic model HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Center, Hydrologic Modeling System), used in combination with the Geospatial Hydrologic Modeling Extension, HEC-GeoHMS, is not a site-specific hydrologic model. Although China has seen the applications of many hydrologic and hydraulic models, HEC-HMS is seldom applied in China, and where it is applied, it is not applied holistically. This paper presents a holistic application of HEC-HMS. Its applicability, capability and suitability for flood forecasting in catchments were examined. The DEMs (digital elevation models) of the study areas were processed using HEC-GeoHMS, an ArcView GIS extension for catchment delineation, terrain pre-processing, and basin processing. The model was calibrated and verified using historical observed data. The determination coefficients and coefficients of agreement for all the flood events were above 0.9, and the relative errors in peak discharges were all within the acceptable range.", "Measurement and assessment of water resources carrying capacity in Henan Province, China ": "As demands on limited water resources intensify, concerns are being raised about water resources carrying capacity (WRCC), which is defined as the maximum sustainable socioeconomic scale that can be supported by available water resources and while maintaining defined environmental conditions. This paper proposes a distributed quantitative model for WRCC, based on the principles of optimization, and considering hydro-economic interaction, water supply, water quality, and socioeconomic development constraints. With the model, the WRCCs of 60 subregions in Henan Province were determined for different development periods. The results showed that the water resources carrying level of Henan Province was suitably loaded in 2010, but that the province would be mildly overloaded in 2030 with respect to the socioeconomic development planning goals. The restricting factors for WRCC included the available water resources, the increasing rate of GDP, the urbanization ratio, the irrigation water utilization coefficient, the industrial water recycling rate, and the wastewater reuse rate, of which the available water resources was the most crucial factor. Because these factors varied temporally and spatially, the trends in predicted WRCC were inconsistent across different subregions and periods.", "Impact of climate change on hydropower generation in Rio Jubones Basin,\u00a0Ecuador ": "This study attempted to use the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), integrated with geographic information systems (GIS), for assessment of climate change impacts on hydropower generation. This methodology of climate change impact modeling was developed and demonstrated through application to a hydropower plant in the Rio Jubones Basin in Ecuador. ArcSWAT 2012 was used to develop a model for simulating the river flow. The model parameters were calibrated and validated on a monthly scale with respect to the hydro-meteorological inputs observed from 1985 to 1991 and from 1992 to 1998, respectively. Statistical analyses produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSEs) of 0.66 and 0.61 for model calibration and validation, respectively, which were considered acceptable. Numerical simulation with the model indicated that climate change could alter the seasonal flow regime of the basin, and the hydropower potential could change due to the changing climate in the future. Scenario analysis indicates that, though the hydropower generation will increase in the wet season, the plant will face a significant power shortage during the dry season, up to 13.14% from the reference scenario, as a consequence of a 17% reduction of streamflow under an assumption of a 2.9\u00b0C increase in temperature and a 15% decrease in rainfall. Overall, this study showed that hydrological processes are realistically modeled with SWAT and the model can be a useful tool for predicting the impact of climate change.", "Flume experimental study on evolution of a mouth bar under interaction of floods and waves ": "Based on the characteristics of hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the bar area in the Modaomen Estuary, a flume experiment was performed to study the evolution of the longitudinal profile of the mouth bar. The mouth bar evolution was investigated under the impacts of floods with different return periods as well as flood-wave interaction. The results showed that floods with different return periods had significant influences on the evolution of the river mouth bar. Particularly on the inner slope of the mouth bar, the sediment was substantially active and moveable. The inner slope and the bar crest tended to be remarkably scoured. The erosion was intensified with the increase of the magnitude of floods. Moreover, the bar crest moved seawards, while the elevation of the bar crest barely changed. Under the flood-wave interaction, a remarkable amount of erosion on the inner and outer slopes of the mouth bar was also found. The seaward displacement of the bar crest under the interaction of floods and waves was less than it was under only the impact of floods, while more deposition was found on the crest of the mouth bar in this case.", "A comparative study of pseudo-static slope stability analysis using different design codes ": "Many researchers have developed new calculation methods to analyze seismic slope stability problems, but the conventional pseudo-static method is still widely used in engineering design due to its simplicity. Based on the Technical Code for Building Slope Engineering (GB\u00a050330\u20142013) of China and the Guidelines for Evaluating and Mitigating Seismic Hazards in California (SP117), a comparative study on the pseudo-static method was performed. The results indicate that the largest difference between these two design codes lies in determination of the seismic equivalence reduction factor (f\n                     eq). The GB 50330\u20142013 code specifies a single value for f\n                     eq of 0.25. In SP117, numerous factors, such as magnitude and distance, are considered in determining f\n                     eq. Two case studies show that the types of slope stability status evaluated by SP117 are in agreement with those evaluated by the seismic time-history stability analysis and Newmark displacement analysis. The factors of safety evaluated by SP117 can be used in practice for safe design. However, the factors of safety evaluated by GB 50330\u20142013 are risky for slope seismic design.", "Do farmers value rice varieties tolerant to droughts and floods? Evidence from a discrete choice experiment in Odisha, India ": "Abiotic stresses such as droughts and floods significantly constrain rice production in India. New stress tolerant technologies have the potential to reduce yield variability and help insulate farmers from the risks posed by these hazards. Using discrete choice experiments conducted in rural Odisha, we estimate farmers' valuation for drought-tolerant (DT) and submergence-tolerant (SubT) traits embodied in rice cultivars. Our results demonstrate that farmers in both drought-prone as well as submergence prone regions value reduction in yield variability offered by new, stress-tolerant cultivars, and would generally be willing to pay a significant premium for these traits. While virtually all farmers perceive the threat of drought and are willing to pay for protection against drought risk, only farmers in flood-prone areas would be willing to pay for rice that can withstand being submerged for prolonged periods, suggesting the potential for market segmentation along geographical or ecological lines.", "Determining payments for watershed services by hydro-economic modeling for optimal water allocation between agricultural and municipal water use ": "", "Effects of water quality changes on the recreation benefits of swimming in Finland: Combined travel cost and contingent behavior model ": "Finland is a highly coastal country with a large archipelago area and numerous lakes. Consequently, these provide an essential environment for water-based outdoor recreation activities. To improve the information base for evaluating the welfare effects of policy instruments addressing water quality, such as the EU Water Framework Directive, this study examined the effects of changes in water quality on the recreation benefits, focusing on swimming trips in Finland. National recreation inventory data were used to provide information on welfare changes at the national level. The combined travel cost and contingent behavior approach revealed that the recreation value of a swimming trip in the current state was approximately 16 euros. The approach allowed assessment of the welfare effects of water quality changes beyond the observed levels, showing that a hypothetical decrease in water quality to a level at which the water visibility would be less than 1\u00a0m and abundant slime would exist decreased the value to 9 euros. Water quality improvement to a level at which the perceived water visibility would be over 2\u00a0m and no slime would exist increased the value per trip to 22 euros. In total, the overall annual value of all visits made for swimming in the case of water quality improvement increased the recreation benefits by 53\u201380%, while a deterioration in quality decreased the benefits by approximately 80%.", "Analyzing the economic value of thermal power plant cooling water consumption ": "The consumption of water by thermal power plants for cooling purposes has presented several policy and resource allocation challenges in the recent past. There is need for improved economic understanding of thermal power plant water consumption to better address these challenges. In this paper, we examine the economic efficiency of water consumption substitutes for existing thermal power plants. In the long run, a power plant could reduce water consumption by investing in efficiency improvements. In the short run, a power plant could reduce water consumption by curtailing power output. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that these substitutes are not economically efficient; water prices in excess of $1.00/m3 would be required for power plants to make efficiency investments or curtail output. Thermal power plants are therefore not attractive targets for water consumption reduction initiatives based on pricing alone. Furthermore, in the long run, efficiency improvements only show significant water reduction potential for the most inefficient plants. However, the findings of the short run analysis indicate that since thermal power plants are willing to pay water prices in excess of $1.00/m3 before curtailing output, these power plants do not require free reallocation of water from senior water rights holders during periods of scarcity, as has been the practice in several regions. Instead, a more efficient water policy focus would be creation of enabling environments for water market transactions. Such water market transactions could help balance competing water demands during periods of scarcity, while maintaining reliable electricity supply.", "Exploring the potential of local market in remunerating water ecosystem services in Cambodia: An application for endogenous attribute non-attendance modelling ": "Within South East Asia, certification and local market development may play an important role in incentivizing farmers to continue with nature-based solutions delivered by organic or traditional farming practices and avoid using environmentally detrimental production techniques. The purpose of this study is to use economic valuation in order to achieve an empirical understanding of local consumer preferences for different attributes of rice products. Application of the agrarian system approach reveals that rice cultivation systems observed in the Tonle Sape Lake of the Mekong River Basin in Cambodia (our study case) may target three ecosystem services that present the characteristics of public goods and may benefit consumer support. A choice experiment survey was administered among local consumers in the city of Phnom Penh in 2013. Econometric analysis indicates high rate of non-attendance for the price attribute. It also suggests that 17% of the respondents made their choices neglecting attributes describing ecosystem services. However, there are evidence of consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for certified organic rice higher than the price-premium observed on the local market. Furthermore, there is additional WTP value for the preservation of ecosystem services. We discuss the implications of our findings on potential payment for ecosystem services in the specific case of rice.", "How far can investment in efficient irrigation technologies reduce aquifer overdraft? Insights from an expert elicitation in Aguascalientes, Mexico ": "Aquifer overdraft is a key public concern in arid and semiarid regions \u2014where agriculture is responsible of most of the water extraction. To tackle this problem, policy interventions in those regions most frequently focus on investment in irrigation technologies. However, these investments are usually carried out without consideration of the effects on water extraction. Estimation of such effects tend to be expensive and time-consuming because they vary depending on technology- and location-specific conditions, and their interactions. Thus there is the demand for methodologies that can provide cheaper estimates, even if rough. This paper explores whether an expert elicitation can provide insights on the impacts that are reasonable to expect from specific efficient irrigation technologies. Our case study is the aquifer of Valle de Aguascalientes, Mexico \u2014where extraction is more than 80% above of the natural recharge. We have learned that our experts in agronomy and hydrology do not expect that sprinkler or drip technologies will substantially reduce overdraft. These results are policy relevant because both types of technologies are at center of the strategies proposed by the policy makers aiming to solve aquifer overdraft in Aguascalientes.", "Valuing water: Selected applications ": "", "Modeling dynamics and adaptation at operational and structural scales for the ex-ante economic evaluation of large dams in an African context ": "Dams can produce electricity and ensure water security, but at the same time they radically alter the hydrological regime of rivers with significant consequences for the economic and environmental welfare of the region in which they are located. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is currently the most frequently used framework for the economic evaluations of dams. Changes at different time scales influence the economic appraisal of dams. However, change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural level are often not included in the CBA evaluation. Not including change and adaptation limits the realistic estimation of cost and benefits, and the appreciation of resilient solutions that offer satisfactory responses for a large set of future scenarios.\n                  In this paper we consider the specific features of large dams in an African context, and identify methods for an economic evaluation that takes into account for change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural scales, as well as their interplay. These methods are then applied to the ex-ante evaluation of a system of existing dams on the Senegal River Valley. Results indicate the economic potential of the dams under changing conditions, for both adaptive and non-adaptive reservoir operation strategies.", "A micro-scale cost-benefit analysis of building-level flood risk adaptation measures in Los Angeles ": "Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of flood risk adaptation strategies offers policymakers insight into economically optimal strategies for adapting to sea level rise. However, building-level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or building elevation are often evaluated at aggregated spatial scales, which may result in sub-optimal investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a flood risk model and combine it with a micro-scale CBA at the building level to obtain an optimal mix of adaptation measures per area. We apply this approach to Venice Beach in Los Angeles and Naples in Long Beach. We subsequently compare our results with the conventional, spatially aggregated area-based CBA approach. Our findings show that a mix of 35%\u201345% dry-floodproofing measures and 55%\u201365% building elevation measures is optimal. Elevation works best in areas with high inundation depths, while dry-floodproofing is preferable in areas with shallow inundation depths. The optimal mix of measures derived from our micro-scale approach results in an economic efficiency up to 85% higher than that yielded by the commonly applied spatially aggregated approach. We therefore recommend that economic evaluations of building-level adaptation measures are conducted at the smallest possible scale, or that CBAs are performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth.", "Climate change and agriculture: Impacts and adaptation options in South Africa ": "South Africa is likely to experience higher temperatures and less rainfall as a result of climate change. Resulting changes in regional water endowments and soil moisture will affect the productivity of cropland, leading to changes in food production and international trade patterns. High population growth elsewhere in Africa and Asia will put further pressure on natural resources and food security in South Africa. Based on four climate change scenarios from two general circulation models (CSIRO and MIROC) and two IPCC SRES emission scenarios (A1B, B1), this study assesses the potential impacts of climate change on global agriculture and explores two alternative adaptation scenarios for South Africa. The analysis uses an updated GTAP-W model, which distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated agriculture and implements water as an explicit factor of production for irrigated agriculture. For South Africa to adapt to the adverse consequences of global climate change, it would require yield improvements of more than 20 percent over baseline investments in agricultural research and development. A doubling of irrigation development, on the other hand, will not be sufficient to reverse adverse impacts from climate change in the country.", "Household behavior related to water conservation ": "This research investigates the role of the level, structure, and rate of change of water prices, as well as non-price policies and socio-demographic characteristics on households' decision-making regarding indoor and outdoor water conservation practices. In this paper, indoor water conservation choices refer to the presence/absence of low volume toilets and low flow showers in the home. Outdoor water conservation choices refer to the frequency of lawn and garden watering by the household during summer months. The former is estimated with a bivariate probit model, while the latter requires an ordered bi-variate probit model. The data come from Statistics Canada's 2006 Households and the Environment Survey. It provides a national cross-sectional sample of household-level observations on indoor and outdoor water choices. These data are linked to municipal level information on residential water prices, non-price water conservation policies, and weather information assembled by the authors. Potential endogeneity arising from the presence of price and non-price water policy variables is investigated using a simultaneous equations approach. Estimation results provide several insights. First, water prices and household characteristics play important roles in shaping household decision-making regarding both indoor and outdoor water conservation. Second, there is little evidence that non-price water conservation policies influence either indoor or outdoor decision-making. Third, there is evidence of correlation for the two indoor water-conserving choices and also for the frequency of lawn and garden watering decisions. Finally, there is no evidence of endogeneity of water prices and other policy variables.", "Economic valuation of river restoration: An analysis of the valuation literature and its uses in decision-making ": "This paper provides an analysis of existing non-market valuations of river restoration primarily in the United States and Europe. The goals of the river restoration in terms of ecosystem services are identified, as are the valuation methods used. More than two-thirds of the 38 river restorations reviewed sought to restore and protect fish populations, including in many cases threatened or endangered species. River restorations were also frequently undertaken to improve wildlife habitat, and water quality for boating. In terms of the use of non-market valuations in decision making, six of 38 restorations reviewed involved benefit-cost analyses or environmental assessments or equivalent decision documents. While both revealed preference and stated preference methods were used for valuing river restorations, the majority of restoration valuations (27 out of 38, about 70%) utilized stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation method (CVM) and choice experiments (CE). Annual willingness-to-pay per household estimated from the stated preference methods appear logically and positively related to the miles of river restored demonstrating weak scope.", "Financial comparison of seven nitrate reduction strategies for Midwestern agricultural drainage ": "Much work has been invested in the development of practices and technologies that reduce nitrate losses from agricultural drainage in the US Midwest. While each individual practice can be valuable, the effectiveness will be site specific and the acceptability of each approach will differ between producers. To enhance decision making in terms of water quality practices, this work created average cost effectiveness parameters for seven nitrate management strategies (controlled drainage, wetlands, denitrification bioreactors, nitrogen management rate and timing, cover crops, and crop rotation). For each practice, available published cost information was used to develop a farm-level financial model that assessed establishment and maintenance costs as well as examined financial effects of potential yield impacts. Then, each practice's cost values were combined with literature review of N reduction (% N load reduction), which allowed comparison of these seven practices in terms of cost effectiveness (dollars per kg N removed). At \u2212$14 and \u2212$1.60kgN\u22121\n                     yr\u22121, springtime nitrogen application and nitrogen application rate reduction were the most cost effective practices. The in-field vegetative practices of cover crop and crop rotation were the least cost effective (means: $55 and $43kgN\u22121\n                     yr\u22121, respectively). With means of less than $3kgN\u22121\n                     yr\u22121, controlled drainage, wetlands, and bioreactors were fairly comparable with each other. While no individual technology or management approach will be capable of addressing drainage water quality concerns in entirety, this analysis provides measures of average cost effectiveness across these seven strategies that allows direct comparison.", "WTP for water filters and water quality testing services in Guatemala ": "We conduct a contingent valuation study to estimate the willingness to pay for a point-of-use water quality technology and water quality testing services in the highlands of Guatemala. This study is unique in two ways: we measure drinking water quality at the household level through water samples collected at the household and we elicit the willingness to pay for water quality testing services. We find a significant divergence in subjects\u2019 perceptions of water quality and the measured bacteria counts in their household water. This divergence is economically important as perceptions may play a significant role in willingness to pay for water quality improvements.", "Irrigation reservoirs as blue clubs: Governance and policy intervention ": "", "Economic evaluation of green water in cereal crop production: A production function approach ": "A great majority of agricultural water is provided by precipitation that is stored in soil moisture, defined as green water. This water evaporates or transpires through plants, and plays a determinative role in crop growth particularly for rainfed agriculture. This study aims to assess the economic value of green water production factor that has often been ignored in the literature, as the focus was mainly given on blue water resources. We employed the production function valuation method and specify a Cobb-Douglas production function, using cereal production in the Czech Republic as a case-study. Green water use was quantified through CROPWAT model, using year-to-year precipitation and evapotranspiration data at a national level for the period 1993-2014. The green water use values were incorporated into the production function, and the marginal value of green water was elicited by computing its marginal contribution with annual average crop market prices. Estimations were based on empirical time-series data at the national level. The marginal value of green water ranged from 17 to 25 USD/1000\u202fm3. To our best of knowledge this is the first study that reveals the value of green water and its contribution in the production value of cereals compared to other production factors. Our findings complement previous studies regarding the crop productivity of green water. We conclude with policy implications of the study findings, highlighting the use of green water value estimations in the compilation of water accounts, as emerged in the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Water.", "Economic and food security effects of small-scale irrigation technologies in northern Ghana ": "Small-scale irrigation (SSI) technologies can be useful not only to increase crop productivity and income but also as a viable adaptation practice to climate variability. A farm simulation model (FARMSIM) and data from selected SSI technologies piloted in northern Ghana under the \u2018Feed the Future-Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation\u2019 (ILSSI) project were used to assess the economic feasibility of the SSI technologies and their potential to improve income and nutrition of smallholder farm households. Three dry season irrigated crops (onion, corchorus, amaranthus) grown under three agricultural water management regimes were analysed. Results show that adoption of the SSI technologies could increase the net farm profit by 154%\u2013608% against the baseline depending on the \u2018crop type - SSI technology\u2019 combination. Nutrition levels also improved significantly as a result of the improvements in crop yields due to irrigation and use of complementary inputs. However, the results further reveal that the options that utilize capital-intensive SSI technologies such as solar-powered water pumps to grow high value cash crops are constrained by the high investment cost. Currently, farmers tend to choose low-cost SSI technologies such as a traditional watering-cans, which generate low economic returns. Improving access to credit or alternative financing schemes could mitigate the capital constraints and enable smallholders to gain more benefits from participating in market-oriented high-value irrigated production.", "The demand for tap water quality: Survey evidence on water hardness and aesthetic quality ": "We design a survey to provide quantitative evidence about household demand for qualitative aspects of tap water supply. We focus on two characteristics that are of importance for households: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste, smell and appearance. Our survey elicits expenditures on products that improve the overall experience of these characteristics of tap water quality, and administration targets a representative sample of the population in England and Wales. For water hardness, our results show that around 14% of households employ at least one water softener device or purchase products such as softening tablets or descaling agents. For the aesthetic quality of tap water, around 39% of households report some averting behaviour, the most common being the use of filtering devices, purchase of bottled water, or addition of squash or cordial. To study how expenditures on these products vary with the level of service quality, we match household data to highly disaggregated records on regional water hardness (in mg CaCO3/l) and aesthetic quality, as measured by the regional rate of complaints to the water service supplier. Our econometric analysis suggests that households' decision to incur averting expenditures varies with service quality in a statistically and economically significant manner, providing novel evidence that households actively respond to non-health related aspects of tap water quality.", "Water quality decisions and policy for an interstate watershed ": "We develop and apply a dynamic game model with economic, hydrologic, environmental and institutional components for interdependent states to meet water quality goals either jointly or separately. States minimize costs of phosphorus pollution abatement subject to phosphorus dynamics to reach the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) water quality goal across agricultural, urban and stormwater sectors. Comparing noncooperation to cooperation helps delineate key differences in strategies to meet water quality goals. Monte Carlo simulations are used throughout the modeling process to incorporate natural variation in model parameter estimates. Nonlinear and asymmetric cost functions of pollution abatement for each state are estimated from data of each state's implementation of abatement across three sectors. The analysis helps assess how well states achieve the TMDL policy by a government-specified deadline of 2025. Variation in the abatement cost functions across states, sectors and abatement practices within each sector sets the stage to explore sharing of cost minimizing alternatives across all of these scales over time. The least cost option for each state takes into account asymmetry with cooperation across the interstate watershed to reduce total phosphorus load over the time horizon to meet the Clean Water Act goal by the 2025 deadline.", "Optimizing irrigation efficiency improvements in the Aral Sea Basin ": "Water scarcity driven by climate change, growing demand, and inefficient management of water and related infrastructure is a serious threat to livelihoods in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) of Central Asia. In recent decades, downstream water shortages have become increasingly common and inflows into the Aral Sea have become very limited. Meanwhile, water losses are enormous both at conveyance and field levels because of outdated infrastructure and the dominance of highly inefficient basin and furrow irrigation methods. Intensification and modernization of irrigation systems, while requiring investment of scarce capital resources, could thus substantially reduce non-beneficial water consumption and help in coping with increasing water scarcity. This study applies a hydro-economic model that solves for the investment in improved irrigation efficiency across the various irrigation sites in the ASB that delivers the highest economic gains. Improvement of the efficiency of irrigation canals and implementation of field efficiency investments and practices, such as drip irrigation, and alternate dry or short furrow irrigation (for rice), would substantially improve economic outcomes. Conveyance efficiency investments are particularly worthwhile in downstream regions where sandy soils are common and return flows largely feed saline lakes in tail-end depressions. Meanwhile, field-level efficiency should be fully upgraded in all rice-producing regions through the use of drip and alternate wet and dry irrigation, as well as with drip irrigation in the cotton-producing Ferghana Valley of the Syr Darya Basin. The value of these improvements increases with reduced water availability. Implementation of an optimal set of investments could increase basinwide benefits by 20% (from US$ 3.2 to 3.8 billion) under normal water availability and by 40% (from US$ 2.5 to 3.5 billion) under dry conditions (80% of normal supply).", "What is the value of bottled water? Empirical evidence from the Italian retail market ": "Bottled water has become a global business, and Italy is one of the largest producers and consumer countries in the world. However, the Italian bottled water market seems to have reached the maturity stage of its life cycle, and because competitive pressure has strongly increased in this market, producers need to revise their marketing strategies. A variety of products with different features and prices are now available on the market of bottled water, however it is unknown how the retail price of bottled water is affected by its attributes. We thus measured whether, and to what extent, the price of bottled water depends upon its extrinsic (brand, packaging, origin), and intrinsic characteristics (mineral composition). We estimated a hedonic price model using data collected via direct observation of the shelves in various Italian modern retail stores. Our results show that bottled water is highly differentiated and its retail price is mainly affected by extrinsic characteristics. On the basis of these results, several insights are provided for both practitioners and policy makers.", "The economic impacts of water information systems: A systematic review ": "Information systems can yield economic value by providing data and analyses that are useful for improving water operations and planning. Working from a simple typology of water management domains that acknowledges the coupling of supply and demand, we characterize the nature of peer-reviewed and practitioner research that considers or makes reference to the costs and benefits of water-related information. The coverage of the reviewed studies is heterogeneous across domains, sectors, analytical methods, type of information considered, and geographic regions. Studies that discuss costs and benefits of additional information relative to a counterfactual represent a minority (39%) of those reviewed. Most of these counterfactual studies use a model prediction (60%) and/or extrapolate from previous studies (34%); far fewer rely on empirical evidence (24%). Furthermore, measurement of and justification for the proposed benefits and costs \u2013 whether monetized or only quantified \u2013 remains limited. We also comment on several of the more prominent methodologies for analyzing the costs and benefits of investments in improved water information. This leads to reflections on a research agenda that would enrich what is known about the economic value of water resources information, and thereby perhaps improve decision-makers\u2019 ability to make fruitful investments in information systems. In the absence of more rigorous evidence on the contribution that specific systems make to societal well-being, decision-makers will likely remain tentative about further information investments.", "Collective Local Payments for ecosystem services: New local PES between groups, sanctions, and prior watershed trust in Mexico ": "Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs are now high in number, if not always in impact. When groups of users pay groups of service providers, establishing PES involves collective action. We study the creation of collective PES institutions, and their continuation, as group coordination. We use framed lab-in-field experiments with hydroservices users and providers within watersheds participating in Mexico's Matching Funds program in Veracruz, Yucatan and Quintana Roo states. We explore the coordination of contributions between downstream users and upstream providers, plus effects of different types of sanctions that can affect expectations for both users and providers. Both information alone and sanctions raise contributions overall, although outcomes varied by site in line with our rankings of \u2018watershed trust\u2019. For instance, monetary sanctions raise contributions in the watershed we ranked high in trust, yet initially lowered them for the lowest-trust watershed. This suggests that upstream-downstream social capital will be central to new collective local PES, while our overall trends suggest social capital can be raised by successful coordination over time.", "Water use restrictions or wastewater recycling? A Canadian willingness to pay study for reclaimed wastewater ": "Canada is the envy of many countries due to its abundant water resources: 7% of renewable fresh water with 1% of the world's population. However, pressure on this resource is growing; it is exacerbated by predictions of increasing water shortages and reduced reliability of traditional water supplies due to climate change. Canada has begun to examine the potential for the use of reclaimed wastewater to augment water supplies. The literature on reclaimed wastewater reveals a general reluctance to accept its use but that there are some situations in which consumers perceive benefits and are willing to pay for them. This paper investigates one such situation: namely, whether people are willing to pay in order to avoid summer water use restrictions via water supplies augmented with reclaimed wastewater that can be used for toilet flushing. The paper presents the first effort to examine the degree of public acceptance in Canada of supplementing existing water supplies with reclaimed wastewater. Using results from a double bounded contingent valuation survey undertaken in 2009, the paper finds an average annual WTP per household that ranges between $142 and $155, depending upon the scale of the project and upon whether respondents are concerned that other members of their community will not comply with summer water use restrictions, thereby, free riding on others. These values fall within the range of previous estimates in the literature and are somewhat higher than values obtained from Australia where there has been more adaptation to low water supply circumstances.", "The water footprint of poultry, pork and beef: A comparative study in different countries and production systems ": "Agriculture accounts for 92% of the freshwater footprint of humanity; almost one third relates to animal products. In a recent global study, Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2012) [31] show that animal products have a large water footprint (WF) relative to crop products. We use the outcomes of that study to show general trends in the WFs of poultry, pork and beef. We observe three main factors driving the WF of meat: feed conversion efficiencies (feed amount per unit of meat obtained), feed composition and feed origin. Efficiency improves from grazing to mixed to industrial systems, because animals in industrial systems get more concentrated feed, move less, are bred to grow faster and slaughtered younger. This factor contributes to a general decrease in WFs from grazing to mixed to industrial systems. The second factor is feed composition, particularly the ratio of concentrates to roughages, which increases from grazing to mixed to industrial systems. Concentrates have larger WFs than roughages, so that this factor contributes to a WF increase, especially blue and grey WFs, from grazing and mixed to industrial systems. The third factor, the feed origin, is important because water use related to feed crop growing varies across and within regions. The overall resultant WF of meat depends on the relative importance of the three main determining factors. In general, beef has a larger total WF than pork, which in turn has a larger WF than poultry, but the average global blue and grey WFs are similar across the three meat products. When we consider grazing systems, the blue and grey water footprints of poultry and pork are greater than those for beef.", "Treatment of water turbidity and bacteria by using a coagulant extracted from Plantago ovata\n             ": "A biocoagulant was successfully extracted from Plantago ovata by using an FeCl3-induced crude extract (FCE). The potential of FCE to act as a natural coagulant was tested for clarification using the turbid water of a river. Experimental tests were performed to evaluate the effects of turbidity concentration, coagulant quantity, water pH, and humic acid concentration on the coagulation of water turbidity by FCE. The maximum turbidity removal was occurred at water pH<8. At the optimum dosage of FCE, only 0.8mg/L of dissolved organic carbon was released to the treated water. An increase in the humic acid led to the promotion of the water turbidity removal. Results demonstrated that the FCE removed more than 95.6% of all initial turbidity concentrations (50\u2013300NTU). High bacteriological quality was achieved in the treated water. FCE as an eco-friendly biocoagulant was revealed to be a very efficient coagulant for removing turbidity from waters.", "Isolation, characterization and identification of microorganisms from unorganized dairy sector wastewater and sludge samples and evaluation of their biodegradability ": "In developing countries like India, the major part of the dairy sector is under the coverage area of unorganized sector, which lacks adequate treatment facility. In present investigation, the study was done to isolate most frequently occurring active strains adapted to the wastewater physical-chemical conditions and having good biodegradation potential. The 10 isolates were selected on the basis of their efficiency in reducing all the three pollution potential parameters i.e BOD, TSS and Oil and grease content. The identification of selected strains was done by 16S rRNA sequencing. The maximum reduction in BOD3 was shown by isolate no. 25 i.e 89.8% (90mg/l). Isolate no. 4 and 25 were efficient in reducing the TSS content by 88.6%. Isolate no. 27 and 45 were more efficient in reducing the oil and grease content by 88.5% and 90% respectively.", "Dye sequestration using agricultural wastes as adsorbents ": "Color is a visible pollutant and the presence of even minute amounts of coloring substance makes it undesirable due to its appearance. The removal of color from dye-bearing effluents is a major problem due to the difficulty in treating such wastewaters by conventional treatment methods. The most commonly used methods for color removal are biological oxidation and chemical precipitation. However, these processes are effective and economic only in the case where the solute concentrations are relatively high. Most industries use dyes and pigments to color their products. The presence of dyes in effluents is a major concern due to its adverse effect on various forms of life. The discharge of dyes in the environment is a matter of concern for both toxicological and esthetical reasons. It is evident from a literature survey of about 283 recently published papers that low-cost adsorbents have demonstrated outstanding removal capabilities for dye removal and the optimal equilibrium time of various dyes with different charcoal adsorbents from agricultural residues is between 4 and 5h. Maximum adsorptions of acidic dyes were obtained from the solutions with pH 8\u201310. The challenges and future prospects are discussed to provide a better framework for a safer and cleaner environment.", "Treatment of leather industrial effluents by filtration and coagulation processes ": "This study focused on effluents characterization and accessing physical and chemical treatment by filtration and coagulation processes. The analysis results of the raw effluents reveal that the effluents were yellowish-brown color, having basic pH, very high values of BOD5, COD, TDS, TSS, TS and high concentrations of Cr, Na, SO4\n                     2\u2212 and other organic and inorganic constituents. After settling and a subsequent filtration of raw tannery effluents through sand-stone, the filtered effluents were treated with various doses of FeCl3. The study observed that coagulant (FeCl3) of 150mg/L dose near neutral pH showed the best removal efficiencies for major physico-chemical parameters. The analysis results illustrate that most of the physical and chemical parameters were found well below the prescribed permissible limits for effluent discharged. The study suggests that untreated tannery effluents would be treated by a combined process consisting of settling, filtering and coagulating with FeCl3.", "Performance investigation of atmospheric water harvesting systems ": "In this paper performance and limitations of commercially-available atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) systems are experimentally investigated. A new experimental setup and test procedure, following the relevant ASHRAE and ANSI/AHRI standards, are developed to measure the water harvesting rate and input electrical power of several residential-size AWHs from different manufacturers. The setup is equipped with an environmental chamber to mimic all climatic conditions in research laboratory at Simon Fraser University and to obtain performance characteristics of AWH systems. The results show the range of water harvesting rate, energy intensity ranging from 1.02\u202fkWh/L for warm and humid to 6.23\u202fkWh/L for cold and humid climates, and climatic limitations of the conventional AWH technology that can be used as a platform for further development of higher efficiency AWH systems in future.", "Kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamic modeling of liquid phase adsorption of Rhodamine B dye onto Raphia hookerie fruit epicarp ": "Highly efficient low cost adsorbent was prepared from Raphia hookerie fruit epicarp. Characteristics of the prepared low cost adsorbent (RH) was established using scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area. RH was applied for Rhodamine B (RhB) uptake from aqueous solution. Equilibrium adsorption data were fitted using four isotherms and kinetic data tested with five kinetic models. The BET surface area obtained was 0.00351m2/g; SEM reveals large pores that could enhance the uptake of large molecules. Freundlich isotherm best described the uptake of RhB onto RH, the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (qmax) was 666.67mg/g. Pseudo second order model best described the kinetics of adsorption process. Energy of adsorption (E) obtained from D-R isotherm suggests physical adsorption. Desorption efficiency follows the order H2O>HCl>CH3COOH. Cost analysis shows that RH is about 1143 times more economical when compared with commercial activated carbon.", "Sustainable water management and improved corporate reporting in mining ": "The advent of corporate sustainability reporting and water accounting standards has resulted in increased disclosure of water use by mining companies. However, there has been limited compilation and analysis of these disclosures. To address this, we compiled a database of 8314 data points from 359 mining company reports, classified according to mining industry water accounting guidelines. The quality of disclosures is shown to have improved considerably over time. Although, opportunities still exist to improve reporting practices, such as by ensuring that all relevant water flows are reported and to explicitly state non-existent flows (e.g. discharges). Initial data analysis reveals considerable variability in water withdrawals, use efficiency and discharges between mining operations. Further work to improve industry coverage and to analyse the influence of mine specific factors such as ore processing methods and local climate will provide insights into the interactions of mining and water resources at a global scale.", "Water equity \u2013 Contrasting tourism water use with that of the local community ": "Tourism as an economic activity has grown substantially and is increasingly adding to local and seasonal pressures on water supply systems of tourist destinations around the world. Based on data from the AQUASTAT and EarthCheck tourist accommodation databases, this research analysed tourism-related water use in 21 countries and compared it with other municipal use. Tourists\u05f3 water use on a per guest night basis was found to differ substantially, with water usage being highest (up to 956l per guest night in China) and most diverse in developing countries. The disparity between tourist water use and that of locals is also greatest in low or mid-income countries. Industrialised countries, in contrast, are characterised by high tourism water efficiencies, with no apparent discrepancy in water use between tourism and non-tourism users. Implications of this research for managing potential water conflicts and the need for broader tourist destination stewardship for water resources are discussed.", "Development of iron oxide/activated carbon nanoparticle composite for the removal of Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions from aqueous solution ": "Iron oxide (Fe3O4) and iron oxide/activated carbon (Fe3O4/AC) were fabricated by co-precipitation method for the removal of Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions from aqueous solution in batch mode. These nanoparticles were characterized by BET, FTIR, XRD, SEM/TEM and VSM. The optimum conditions for the removal of ions were pH\u202f=\u202f2 for Cr(VI) and 6 for Cu(II) and Cd(II),\u00a0initial metal ion concentration\u202f=\u202f50\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121,\u00a0nanoparticle dose\u202f=\u202f50\u202fmg/10\u202fmL, temperature\u202f=\u202f25\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C, shaking speed\u202f=\u202f180\u202frpm and contact time\u202f=\u202f3\u202fh. The equilibrium data of ions sorption were well described by Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Intraparticle Diffusion model. The R2 values obtained by Langmuir model were highest by Fe3O4/AC for Cr(VI)\u202f=\u202f0.9994,Cu(II)\u202f=\u202f0.9998 and Cd(II)=\u202f0.9750. The temperature dependent study in the range of 288\u2013328\u202fK confirmed that the adsorption process was endothermic in nature. Desorption studies with 0.1\u202fM HCl stated that these nanoparticles can be regenerated effectively and can be used after four adsorption-desorption cycles without any mass loss.", "Characterization of effluent from food processing industries and stillage treatment trial with Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) and Panicum maximum (Jacq.) ": "In this study, effluents from 11 food processing industries from various sectors were characterized through analysis of physical and chemical parameters. In general, effluents pHs are between 4.07 and 7.63. Lead (Pb2+) and cadmium (Cd+) concentrations range from 0.083 to 1.025mg/l and 0.052\u20130.158mg/l respectively. The biodegradability of the effluent is very low. The principal component analysis (PCA) grouped industries according to their organic matter levels; thus, stillage, livestock, molasses and sugar refinery effluents show some similarities, as well as confectionery, oil mill, dairy and brewery effluents. Forms of nitrogen measured show low levels of nitrites (NO2\n                     \u2212), high levels of nitrates (NO3\n                     \u2212), ammonium (NH4\n                     +) and Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). Among these effluents, a treatment trial with Eichhornia crassipes and Panicum maximum was applied to stillage effluent from Fermencam distillery. The results show that Panicum maximum and Eichhornia crassipes reduce pollutant loads of Fermencam's wastewater.", "Water and detergent recovery from rinsing water in an industrial environment ": "Wash water streams coming from rinsing of equipment in a detergent production site is in many cases considered as waste. On site treatment in waste water plants is possible but typically requires advanced oxidation process (AOP) technology which uses chemicals and creates a waste sludge. A new treatment approach, based on nanofiltration, has been demonstrated at industrial scale in a detergent production site in China. Wash water could be split into a concentrate stream and water fraction. The concentrate stream contains most of the valuable surfactants and has a value to recycle. The water fraction can easily be polished by MBR to feed cooling towers. As such, this production site does not discharge any process wash water and recovers all resources out of the rinsing water: both chemicals (as surfactants) as the water.", "Application of Taguchi method for optimizing the process parameters for the removal of copper and nickel by growing Aspergillus sp. ": "In the present study, the process parameters affecting biosorption were optimized by adopting Analysis of Mean (ANOM) approach for maximizing the percentage removal of copper and nickel by growing Aspergillus sp. in batch reactor using Taguchi method. The process parameters include inoculum concentration, initial metal concentration, pH and temperature. The optimized conditions were found to be 15% v/v inoculum concentration, 50mgl\u22121 concentration of copper/nickel, pH 4 and temperature 30\u00b0C. The percentage contribution of each process parameter on the removal of copper/nickel determined using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method followed the order: concentration of copper/nickel>inoculum concentration>pH>temperature. The percentage removal of copper and nickel realized in the confirmatory experiments carried out at optimized conditions was found to be higher than that obtained in all the test runs of Taguchi design, thereby supporting the accuracy of optimization of process parameters under the given set of experimental conditions.", "Additive and additive-free treatment technologies for pulp and paper mill effluents: Advances, challenges and opportunities ": "In the present manuscript, novel effluent treatment processes for pulp and paper mill effluents are divided into two categories: a) those involving the use of chemical additives and b) those which are free of such chemicals. It is especially of high importance for pulp and paper industry to adopt the most efficient and cost-effective treatment methods. This paper critically reviews the recent studies on the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents while providing suggestions for further studies on the application of various physic-chemical and biological methods for the treatment of such complex effluents containing a number of recalcitrant pollutants.", "Hydrogeological and groundwater modeling studies to estimate the groundwater inflows into the coal Mines at different mine development stages using MODFLOW, Andhra Pradesh, India ": "The Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) is exploiting coal in the Godavari valley coal fields spread over 5.33km2 in Andhra Pradesh, India. In the area, six workable coal seams have been identified in Barakar formation by the analysis of the geologic logs of 183 bore wells. A finite difference based numerical groundwater flow model is developed with twenty conceptual layers and with a total thickness of 320m. The flow model was calibrated under steady state conditions and predicted groundwater inflows into the mine pits at different mine development stages. The groundwater budget results revealed that the mining area would receive net groundwater inflows of 5877m3\n                     day\u22121, 12,818m3\n                     day\u22121, 12,910m3\n                     day\u22121, 20,428m3\n                     day\u22121, 22,617m3\n                     day\u22121 and 14,504m3\n                     day\u22121 at six mine development stages of +124m (amsl), +93m (amsl), +64m (amsl), +41m (amsl), +0m (amsl) and \u221241m (amsl), respectively. The results of the study can be used to plan optimal groundwater pumping and the possible locations to dewater the groundwater for safe mining at different mine development stages.", "The blue and grey water footprint of construction materials: Steel, cement and glass ": "Numerous studies have been published on water footprints (WFs) of agricultural products, but much less on WFs of industrial products. The latter are often composed of various basic materials. Already the basic materials follow from a chain of processes, each with its specific water consumption (blue WF) and pollution (grey WF). We assess blue and grey WFs of five construction materials: chromium-nickel unalloyed steel, unalloyed steel, Portland cement (CEM I), Portland composite cement (CEM II/B) and soda-lime glass. Blue and grey WFs are added up along production chains, following life cycle inventory and WF accounting procedures. Steel, cement and glass have WFs dominated by grey WFs, that are 20\u2013220 times larger than the blue WFs. For steel, critical pollutants are cadmium, copper and mercury; for cement, these are mercury or cadmium; for glass, suspended solids. Blue WFs of steel, cement and glass are mostly related to electricity use.", "Assessment of activated carbon prepared from corncob by chemical activation with phosphoric acid ": "Corncob, which is the main waste from corn agricultures in Egypt, has been used as a raw material for the preparation of different activated carbons. Activated carbons (ACs) were prepared by chemical activation with concentrated H3PO4 acid; followed by pyrolysis at 400, 500 and 600\u00b0C. Different ACs have been used for the removal of methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. Batch adsorption experiments were performed as a function of initial dye concentration, contact time, adsorbent dose and pH. Adsorption data were modeled using the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. Adsorption of MB on AC1 (R\n                     2=0.9868) and AC2 (R\n                     2=0.9810) followed Langmuir model with maximum monolayer sorption capacity of 28.65 and 17.57mg/g, respectively. Adsorption onto AC3 was better fitted to Freundlich isotherm model (R\n                     2=0.9823).", "Hydrogeochemical characteristics and groundwater contamination in the rapid urban development areas of Coimbatore, India ": "The Singanallur Sub-basin is one of the major waterways and it supplies water to the Coimbatore city. Currently, it is vulnerable to pollution due to an increase of unplanned urban developments, industrial, and agricultural activities that compromise both the quality and quantity. In the present study three major hydrochemical facies were identified (mixed Ca-Mg-Cl, Ca-Cl, and Ca-HCO3). Irrigation suitability indexes are specifies that the groundwater in the areas has very high salinity hazard and low to medium alkali hazard. The mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry originally regulated by the evaporation process is dominated by reason of arid condition and anthropogenic activities existing throughout the region. The multivariate statistical analysis (Correlation analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)) indicates, most of the variations are elucidated by the anthropogenic pollutant predominantly due to population growth, industrial effluents, and irrigation water return flow. This study demonstrates enhanced information of evolution of groundwater quality by integrating hydrochemical data and multivariate statistical methods are used to understand the factors influencing contamination due to natural and anthropogenic impacts.", "Biodegradation of dairy effluent by using microbial isolates obtained from activated sludge ": "Water resources are of significant importance to human beings. The present investigation was carried out for biodegradation of dairy effluent by using selected aerobic microbial isolates and a model having layers of sawdust and activated charcoal as filtering media. Yeast isolates (DSI1) and two bacterial isolates (DSI2 and DSI3) were obtained from the dairy sludge. A mixed culture (DSI4) was prepared by taking 1:1, DSI1 and DSI3 to treat the effluent and check its efficiency. After aeration period of 48h, mixed culture of dairy sludge isolates proved to be most efficient in treatment of effluent. DSI2 showed least reduction in chemical oxygen demand. After aeration, the reduction efficiency of DSI4 was highest by 47.52% in biological oxygen demand in comparison with other isolates. DSI3 was second most effective in reduction of water parameters mainly electrical conductivity, totals solids, chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand.", "Review of methods to assess sustainability of industrial water use ": "The projected increase of industrial water demands raises the need to assess the environmental sustainability of industrial water use. Assessment methods need to use Sustainable Systems Indicators (SSIs) which relate resource use to the carrying capacity of the local environment. SSIs for water use evaluate whether water use exceeds the natural water renewal (quantity) and whether emissions remain within the assimilation capacity of ecosystems (quality). We systematically reviewed the scientific literature to show which methods are used to assess industrial water use, and of these, which methods incorporate SSIs. In total, 82 assessment methods were identified in 340 papers. The methods were assigned to five categories: Key Performance Indicators, Composite Indices, Environmental Accounting, Material and Energy Flow Analysis, and Life Cycle Analysis. In 26% of the reviewed papers, the assessment methods used SSIs. The number of papers incorporating SSIs is growing at a slower rate than the overall number of papers in the area of sustainability assessments of industrial water use. Considering the expected growth in industrial water use this poses a risk to sustainable water use. The best performing category in terms of incorporating SSIs is Material and Energy Flow Analysis (42% of papers). Papers assessing several industrial sectors in the same study incorporate SSIs more frequently (68%) than research focused on a single industry or process (20%). We discuss examples from the reviewed papers which successfully incorporate SSIs, in order to: (1) identify the elements needed to create SSIs for industrial water use, (2) aid researchers and practitioners in selecting methods which incorporate SSIs, and (3) provide a starting point for future methodological development incorporating SSIs.", "Industrial water mass balance as a tool for water management in industrial parks ": "Industry is demanding ever-greater volumes of water, while at the same time producing wastes and effluents, which in many places taint and damage the quality of this precious resource on which all life depends. This article formalizes a systematic water mass balance framework to quantify all anthropogenic and natural water flows into, water flows inside and effluents out of the industrial parks. Quantitative performance indicators are derived, including management and operation indicators. The approach makes visible large flows of water that have previously been unaccounted and ignored. In 2012\u20132014, the water consumption, which made up 59.5\u201390.2% of industrial water withdrawal, was 8.5\u201351.2% higher than wastewater generation. The approach demonstrates how the principles of water balance can help robust water accounting, monitoring, optimum operating and management in industrial parks. Furthermore, performance indicators could evolve to a useful tool for leading to more systematic analysis of the impact of industrial design and management.", "Wastewater characterization and treatment at a blueberry and carrot processing plant ": "Carrot and blueberry processing wastewaters were tested to determine total suspended solids (TSS) and organics (COD and BOD5) levels before and after wastewater treatment. Wastewater treatment by filtration through 1/8\u2033 and 1/16\u2033 reels provided no significant reduction in either TSS, COD or BOD5. Blueberry wastewater was found to have TSS concentrations of 297\u202f\u00b1\u202f85 mgL\u22121, BOD5 concentrations of 1013\u202f\u00b1\u202f292 mgL\u22121, a maximum respiration rate of 10.3\u202fmg(L\u202fh)\u22121 and COD concentrations of 1947\u202f\u00b1\u202f388 mgL\u22121 before discharge. The final effluent of carrot processing wastewater had TSS concentrations of 3030\u202f\u00b1\u202f2975 mgL\u22121, BOD5 concentrations of 2780\u202f\u00b1\u202f1848 mgL\u22121, a maximum respiration rate of 65\u202fmg(L\u202fh)\u22121 and COD concentrations of 6363\u202f\u00b1\u202f2760 mgL\u22121. After acclimatization, extended respiration tests indicated a dramatic reduction in oxygen demand was possible in post-reel wastewater, with a 75% reduction in respiration rate over 150\u202fh for blueberry wastewater and an 85% reduction in respiration rate over only 20\u202fh for the more organically-rich carrot wastewater.\n                  Bench-scale treatments of preliminary settling, alum coagulation and sedimentation, and aeration were performed on the carrot processing wastewater. Preliminary settling and coagulation-sedimentation were highly effective for TSS removal, achieving 99% reduction in TSS as compared to raw wastewater, but were not effective for organics removal, however, aeration for eight hours with activated sludge achieved 73% removal of COD and 42% removal of BOD5, indicating that biological treatment was the most promising avenue for organics removal from carrot processing wastewater.", "The water footprint of electricity in Ecuador: Technology and fuel variation indicate pathways towards water-efficient electricity mixes ": "Hydropower, biomass and thermal power plants (HPPs, BPPs and TPPs) consume water. The WF tool quantifies freshwater consumption. We calculated direct and indirect WFs of 255 Ecuadorian power plants using different technologies and fuels classified into eleven subclasses. Median WFs are largest for BPPs, followed by HPPs, while WFs of TPPs were smallest, but variation in subclasses is enormous. For HPPs, dammed HPPs have relatively large blue WFs, run-of-the-river HPPs have relatively small WFs, although they are significant to their electricity output. The cooling system is paramount for TPPs subclasses. Water-efficient cooling systems (once-through and dry-cooling) have 20% smaller WFs than wet-tower systems. Moreover, the fuel used affects the direct WF of TPPs significantly. Fuel and residue oil require water-intensive preheating; some diesel-fired TPPs use water as GHG control. BPPs are water-intensive because biomass has a large WF. Technology and fuel variation indicate pathways towards more water-efficient electricity mixes.", "Cultivation of algae consortium in a dairy farm wastewater for biodiesel production ": "Dairy farm wastewaters are potential resources for production of microalgae biofuels. A study was conducted to evaluate the capability of production of biodiesel from consortium of native microalgae culture in dairy farm treated wastewater. Native algal strains were isolated from dairy farm wastewaters collection tank (untreated wastewater) as well as from holding tank (treated wastewater). The consortium members were selected on the basis of fluorescence response after treating with Nile red reagent. Preliminary studies of two commercial and consortium of ten native strains of algae showed good growth in wastewaters. A consortium of native strains was found capable to remove more than 98% nutrients from treated wastewater. The biomass production and lipid content of consortium cultivated in treated wastewater were 153.54tha\u22121\n                     year\u22121 and 16.89%, respectively. 72.70% of algal lipid obtained from consortium could be converted into biodiesel.", "Adsorption studies of arsenic(III) removal from water by zirconium polyacrylamide hybrid material (ZrPACM-43) ": "A novel hybrid material zirconium polyacrylamide (ZrPACM-43) was synthesized by mixing aqueous solution of zirconium oxychloride and mixture of acrylamide following an environmental friendly sol\u2013gel method. The material was characterized by FTIR, XRD, TGA-DTA, and SEM-EDS. The extent of arsenic removal capacity was tested by the material by varying the solution parameters like adsorbent dose, adsorbate concentration, pH of the solution, contact time and temperature. The maximum removal efficiency of arsenic(III) was 98.22% under optimum conditions with adsorption equilibrium time of 120min. The adsorption process followed second order kinetics and adsorption data were best fitted to linearly transformed Freundlich isotherm with correlation coefficient of R\n                     2>0.999. Adsorption capacity (q\n                     o) calculated from Langmuir isotherm was found to be 41.48mgg\u22121. The thermodynamic parameter \u0394H indicates an endothermic adsorption process. The regeneration study shows that the material is regenerated by 1M alkali solution.", "Pursuing water security in socio-hydrological systems ": "", "Water reallocation, benefit sharing, and compensation in northeastern Mexico: A retrospective assessment of El Cuchillo Dam ": "In 1994, former President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari inaugurated El Cuchillo reservoir to transfer up to 10\u202fm3/s from the Lower San Juan River to the city of Monterrey, a major Mexican metropolis. Since 1989, three agreements have been developed to finance, construct and operate the El Cuchillo project to benefit Monterrey and compensate the farmers in the downstream irrigation district. This study reviews the agreements and lessons from implementation experience after 25\u202fyears since the project\u2019s inauguration. The El Cuchillo demonstrates that water reallocation needs to be designed and assessed within a regional perspective to identify, measure and share the costs and benefits of reallocation between rural and urban regions. This case study shows the need to compensate the region not the individual.", "Planning for sustained water-electricity resilience over the U.S.: Persistence of current water-electricity operations and long-term transformative plans ": "The electricity system relies upon the availability and predictability of water to support hydropower operations and cooling of thermoelectric plants, implying that water plays a fundamental role in power operations and that water-related stresses may have a critical effect on the electricity system. Designing for electricity system resilience to changing societal demands and environmental conditions is a complex and urgent endeavor, one that requires robust diagnosis and an articulation of interdependencies among key system components. Here we consider the argument that water may help to navigate that complexity, revealing thresholds for system change and the transformations that may be required for enduring resilience of the electricity sector. To assess this thesis, we apply a framework for understanding resilient systems following Folke et al. (2010), that is extended in this special issue (Boltz et al., 2019), by which resilience comprises three capabilities: system persistence, adaptability, and transformability. We apply this resilience diagnosis approach to the bulk electricity system of the contiguous United States, with particular attention to water-driven stressors. We provide a qualitative narrative that discusses the spectrum of resilience capabilities (persistence, adaptability, and transformability) of the water-electricity system in the United States over three scales of inter-dependencies: individual power plant, urban and grid scales.", "Socio-hydrological assessment of water security in canal irrigation systems: A conjoint quantitative analysis of equity and reliability ": "This paper offers a socio-hydrological assessment of water security that compares canal irrigation entitlements with water deliveries using a conjoint analysis of system reliability and equity. We develop a set of definitions and metrics to quantitatively characterize reliability and equity using newly available datasets of 10-daily canal deliveries from 2007\u20132017 in the Punjab canal command areas in the Indus Basin Irrigation System of Pakistan, where emphasis has shifted from distributing historically-defined volumetric supplies to improving irrigation efficiencies and crop yields in order to achieve greater aggregate water and food security. Our analysis reveals stagnation and oscillation over time in system-level equity and reliability. We reflect on the potential to positively affect canal irrigation performance and water security through a socio-hydrological approach.", "Hyperspectral narrowband and multispectral broadband indices for remote sensing of crop evapotranspiration and its components (transpiration and soil evaporation) ": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of micro- and macro-scale climatic processes. In agriculture, estimates of ET are frequently used to monitor droughts, schedule irrigation, and assess crop water productivity over large areas. Currently, in situ measurements of ET are difficult to scale up for regional applications, so remote sensing technology has been increasingly used to estimate crop ET. Ratio-based vegetation indices retrieved from optical remote sensing, like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, and Enhanced Vegetation Index are critical components of these models, particularly for the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation. These indices have their limitations, however, and can induce large model bias and error. In this study, micrometeorological and spectroradiometric data collected over two growing seasons in cotton, maize, and rice fields in the Central Valley of California were used to identify spectral wavelengths from 428 to 2295nm that produced the highest correlation to and lowest error with ET, transpiration, and soil evaporation. The analysis was performed with hyperspectral narrowbands (HNBs) at 10nm intervals and multispectral broadbands (MSBBs) commonly retrieved by Earth observation platforms. The study revealed that (1) HNB indices consistently explained more variability in ET (\u0394R\n                     2\n                     =0.12), transpiration (\u0394R\n                     2\n                     =0.17), and soil evaporation (\u0394R\n                     2\n                     =0.14) than MSBB indices; (2) the relationship between transpiration using the ratio-based index most commonly used for ET modeling, NDVI, was strong (R\n                     2\n                     =0.51), but the hyperspectral equivalent was superior (R\n                     2\n                     =0.68); and (3) soil evaporation was not estimated well using ratio-based indices from the literature (highest R\n                     2\n                     =0.37), but could be after further evaluation, using ratio-based indices centered on 743 and 953nm (R\n                     2\n                     =0.72) or 428 and 1518nm (R\n                     2\n                     =0.69).", "Review of indirect optical measurements of leaf area index: Recent advances, challenges, and perspectives ": "Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter of vegetation structure in the fields of agriculture, forestry, and ecology. Optical indirect methods based on the Beer-Lambert law are widely adopted in numerous fields given their high efficiency and feasibility for LAI estimation. These methods have undergone considerable progress in the past decades, thereby making them operational in ground-based LAI measurement and even in airborne estimation. However, several challenges remain, given the requirement of increasing accuracy and new applications. Clumping effect correction attained significant progress for continuous canopies with non-randomly disturbed leaves while non-continuous canopies are rarely studied. Convenient and operational measurement of leaf angle distribution and woody components is lacked. Accurate and comprehensive validations are still very difficult due to the limitations of direct measurement. The introduction of active laser scanning technology is a driving force for addressing several challenges, but its three-dimensional information has not been fully explored and utilized. In order to update the general knowledge and identify the possible error source, this study comprehensively reviews the temporal development, theoretical framework, and issues of indirect LAI measurement, followed by current methods, instruments, and platforms. Latest methods and instruments are introduced and compared to traditional ones. Current challenges, recent advances, and future perspectives are discussed to provide recommendations for further research.", "Assimilation of remote sensing into crop growth models: Current status and perspectives ": "Timely monitoring of crop lands is important in order to make agricultural activities more sustainable, as well as ensuring food security. The use of Earth Observation (EO) data allows crop monitoring at a range of spatial scales, but can be hampered by limitations in the data. Crop growth modelling, on the other hand, can be used to simulate the physiological processes that result in crop development. Data assimilation (DA) provides a way of blending the monitoring properties of EO data with the predictive and explanatory abilities of crop growth models. In this paper, we first provide a critique of both the advantages and disadvantages of both EO data and crop growth models. We use this to introduce a solid and robust framework for DA, where different DA methods are shown to be derived from taking different assumptions in solving for the a posteriori probability density function (pdf) using Bayes\u2019 rule. This treatment allows us to provide some recommendation on the choice of DA method for particular applications. We comment on current computational challenges in scaling DA applications to large spatial scales. Future areas of research are sketched, with an emphasis on DA as an enabler for blending different observations, as well as facilitating different approaches to crop growth models. We have illustrated this review with a large number of examples from the literature.", "Integrating satellite and climate data to predict wheat yield in Australia using machine learning approaches ": "Wheat is the most important staple crop grown in Australia, and Australia is one of the top wheat exporting countries globally. Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine-learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD) level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark) and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network) to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R2 \u02dc 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction.", "Monitoring crop phenology using a smartphone based near-surface remote sensing approach ": "Smallholder farmers play a critical role in supporting food security in developing countries. Monitoring crop phenology and disturbances to crop growth is critical in strengthening farmers\u2019 ability to manage production risks. This study assesses the feasibility of using crowdsourced near-surface remote sensing imagery to monitor winter wheat phenology and identify damage events in northwest India. In particular, we demonstrate how streams of pictures of individual smallholder fields, taken using inexpensive smartphones, can be used to quantify important phenological stages in agricultural crops, specifically the wheat heading phase and how it can be used to detect lodging events, a major cause of crop damage globally. Near-surface remote sensing offers granular visual field data, providing detailed information on the timing of key developmental phases of winter wheat and crop growth disturbances that are not registered by common satellite remote sensing vegetation indices or national crop cut surveys. This illustrates the potential of near-surface remote sensing as a scalable platform for collecting high-resolution plot-specific data that can be used in supporting crop modeling, extension and insurance schemes to increase resilience to production risk and enhance food security in smallholder agricultural systems.", "The relationship between leaf area index and microclimate in tropical forest and oil palm plantation: Forest disturbance drives changes in microclimate ": "Land use change is a major threat to biodiversity. One mechanism by which land use change influences biodiversity and ecological processes is through changes in the local climate. Here, the relationships between leaf area index and five climate variables \u2013 air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit, specific humidity and soil temperature \u2013 are investigated across a range of land use types in Borneo, including primary tropical forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. Strong correlations with the leaf area index are found for the mean daily maximum air and soil temperatures, the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and the mean daily minimum relative humidity. Air beneath canopies with high leaf area index is cooler and has higher relative humidity during the day. Forest microclimate is also found to be less variable for sites with higher leaf area indices. Primary forest is found to be up to 2.5\u00b0C cooler than logged forest and up to 6.5\u00b0C cooler than oil palm plantations. Our results indicate that leaf area index is a useful parameter for predicting the effects of vegetation upon microclimate, which could be used to make small scale climate predictions based on remotely sensed data.", "Light interception in experimental forests affected by tree diversity and structural complexity of dominant canopy ": "Biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning in forests by, for example, enhancing growth and altering the forest structure towards greater complexity with cascading effects on other processes and trophic levels. Complexity in forest canopy could enhance light interception and form a link between diversity and productivity in polyculture forests, but the effect of canopy structure on light interception is rarely directly measured.\n                  We modelled the canopy surface structure of a tree diversity experiment by photographing it using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and combining the photos into a digital elevation model with photogrammetry tools. We analysed the effects of tree diversity and functional diversity on canopy structural complexity and light interception with a structural equation model.\n                  Our results show that: a) increased structural complexity of the canopy reduces light interception, whereas b) tree diversity increases the structural complexity of the canopy, and has a dual impact on light interception. Tree diversity decreased light interception through the structural complexity of the canopy but increased it probably through canopy packing and crown complementarity. However, the effects of both tree diversity and structural complexity of canopy were smaller than the effect of the functional identities of the tree species, especially the differences between deciduous and evergreen trees.\n                  We conclude that more complexity in canopy structure can be gained through increased tree diversity, but complex canopy structure does not increase light interception in young forests.", "Three dimensional mapping of forest canopy equivalent water thickness using dual-wavelength terrestrial laser scanning ": "Globally, forests are being subjected to numerous threats, including climate change, wildfires, and insect and disease outbreaks, among others. Satellite optical remote sensing data have been widely utilized in early detection of tree and forest stress by estimating water status metrics such as the leaf Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). This estimate, however, is affected by soil characteristics and understory vegetation and often ignores the effects of the fine-scale heterogeneity of canopy structure and leaf water content. Such effects can be better understood by studying the EWT distribution in three dimensions. In this study, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) intensity data from the commercially-available Leica P20 and P40 instruments (808\u202fnm and 1550\u202fnm respectively) were combined in a Normalized Difference Index (NDI). NDI was used to map EWT of 12 trees in three dimensions from floor to canopy in a mixed broadleaf forest plot (Wytham Woods, UK). The average error in EWT estimates across three species was less than 8%. The three dimensional point clouds revealed that, in this snapshot, EWT changes vertically, usually increasing towards canopy top. The proposed method has the potential to provide predawn EWT measurements, is independent of solar illumination, and can lead to a better understanding of the factors affecting satellite estimation of EWT.", "\n               Coffea arabica yields decline in Tanzania due to climate change: Global implications ": "Coffee is the world\u2019s most valuable tropical export crop. Recent studies predict severe climate change impacts on Coffea arabica (C. arabica) production. However, quantitative production figures are necessary to provide coffee stakeholders and policy makers with evidence to justify immediate action. Using data from the northern Tanzanian highlands, we demonstrate for the first time that increasing night time (T\n                     min) temperature is the most significant climatic variable responsible for diminishing C. arabica yields between 1961 and 2012. Projecting this forward, every 1\u00b0C rise in T\n                     min will result in annual yield losses of 137\u00b116.87kgha\u22121 (P\n                     =1.80e-10). According to our ARIMA model, average coffee production will drop to 145\u00b141kgha\u22121 (P\n                     =8.45e-09) by 2060. Consequently, without adequate adaptation strategies and/or substantial external inputs, coffee production will be severely reduced in the Tanzanian highlands in the near future. Attention should also be drawn to the arabica growing regions of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Kenya, as substantiated time series evidence shows these areas have followed strikingly similar minimum temperature trends. This is the first study on coffee, globally, providing essential time series evidence that climate change has already had a negative impact on C. arabica yields.", "Water productivity of rainfed maize and wheat: A local to global perspective ": "Water productivity (WP) is a robust benchmark for crop production in relation to available water supply across spatial scales. Quantifying water-limited potential (WPw) and actual on-farm (WPa) WP to estimate WP gaps is an essential first step to identify the most sensitive factors influencing production capacity with limited water supply. This study combines local weather, soil, and agronomic data, and crop modeling in a spatial framework to determine WPw and WPa at local and regional levels for rainfed cropping systems in 17 (maize) and 18 (wheat) major grain-producing countries representing a wide range of cropping systems, from intensive, high-yield maize in north America and wheat in west Europe to low-input, low-yield maize systems in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. WP was calculated as the quotient of either water-limited yield potential or actual yield, and simulated crop evapotranspiration. Estimated WPw upper limits compared well with maximum WP reported for field-grown crops. However, there was large WPw variation across regions with different climate and soil (CV\u202f=\u202f29% for maize and 27% for wheat), which cautions against the use of generic WPw benchmarks and highlights the need for region-specific WPw. Differences in simulated evaporative demand, crop evapotranspiration after flowering, soil evaporation, and intensity of water stress around flowering collectively explained two thirds of the variation in WPw. Average WP gaps were 13 (maize) and 10 (wheat) kg ha\u22121 mm\u22121, equivalent to about half of their respective WPw. We found that non-water related factors (i.e., management deficiencies, biotic and abiotic stresses, and their interactions) constrained yield more than water supply in ca. half of the regions. These findings highlight the opportunity to produce more food with same amount of water, provided limiting factors other than water supply can be identified and alleviated with improved management practices. Our study provides a consistent protocol for estimating WP at local to regional scale, which can be used to understand WP gaps and their mitigation.", "Flux Puppy \u2013 An open-source software application and portable system design for low-cost manual measurements of CO2 and H2O fluxes ": "Manual chamber-based measurements of CO2 (and H2O) fluxes are important for understanding ecosystem carbon metabolism. Small opaque chambers can be used to measure leaf, stem and soil respiration. Larger transparent chambers can be used to measure net ecosystem exchange of CO2, and small jars often serve this purpose for laboratory incubations of soil and plant material. We developed an Android application (app), called Flux Puppy, to facilitate chamber-based flux measurements in the field and laboratory. The app is designed to run on an inexpensive handheld Android device, such as a tablet or phone, and it has a graphical user interface that communicates with a LI-COR LI-820 and LI-830 (CO2) or LI-840 and LI-850 (CO2/H2O) infrared gas analyzer. The app logs concentrations of CO2 and H2O, cell temperature and pressure at 1\u2009Hz, displays the output graphically, and calculates the linear regression slope, R-squared, and standard error of the CO2 time series. A metadata screen allows users to enter operator, site, and plot information, as well as take a photograph using the Android device\u2019s built-in camera, and log measurement location using the device GPS. Additionally, there is a notes field, which can be revised after the measurements are taken. Data files (the 1\u2009s raw data, photograph, and metadata including statistics calculated from the raw data) are then transmitted off the device through file sharing options (Gmail, Outlook, Google Drive, Dropbox etc.). Because Flux Puppy code is open-source (available on GitHub) and the flux measurement system we describe is relatively inexpensive and straightforward to assemble, it should be of broad interest to the carbon cycling community.", "A new spatial modeling and interpolation approach for high-resolution temperature maps combining reanalysis data and ground measurements ": "Despite of their increasing importance as inputs to models for a wide range of scientific fields, high-resolution meteorological variables are not recorded very often on spatially regular grids. This problem is usually overcome by using data from reanalysis models, although they are less accurate. This paper discusses the development of a new spatial downscaling methodology to provide high-resolution maps of daily maximum and minimum air temperature. The application of this approach provides thorough observations in sparsely sampled areas by combining the accuracy of measurements from ground-based stations with the high availability and uniformity of model-based data. The dataset includes more than a decade (2003\u20132013) of data collected at 113 stations, about 30% of which constituted an independent set for the validation procedure. The efficacy of this approach is evaluated using statistical scores that are regularly employed in model evaluation studies and the improvements over the classical approach are remarkable. The results show that overall the our \"hybrid\" method provides fair estimates of temperature values. Particularly, MBE is less than 0.29\u202f\u00b0C and 0.60\u202f\u00b0C for the daily maximum and minimum air temperature respectively; RMSE is less than 1.24\u202f\u00b0C for the maximum temperature and 1.86\u202f\u00b0C for the minimum temperature, the analysis on MAE assures that there is not contribution of the errors in the spatial variability (MAE \u2248 RMSE). The correlation coefficient, close to 1 (\u03c1 \u2248 0.97), indicates a strong positive linear relationship.", "Assessing causes of yield gaps in agricultural areas with diversity in climate and soils ": "Identification of causes of gaps between yield potential and producer yields has been restricted to small geographic areas. In the present study, we developed a novel approach for identifying causes of yield gaps over large agricultural areas with diversity in climate and soils. This approach was applied to quantify and explain yield gaps in rainfed and irrigated soybean in the North-Central USA (NC USA) region, which accounts for about one third of soybean global production. Survey data on yield and management were collected from 3568 producer fields over two crop seasons and grouped into 10 technology extrapolation domains (TEDs) according to their soil, climate, and water regime. Yield potential was estimated using a combination of crop modeling and boundary functions for water productivity and compared against highest producer yields derived from the yield distribution in each TED-year. Yield gaps were calculated as the difference between yield potential and average producer yield. Explanatory factors for yield gaps were investigated by identifying management practices that were concordantly associated with high- and low-yield fields. Management\u00d7TED interactions were then evaluated to elucidate the underlying causes of yield gaps. The chosen spatial TED framework accounted for about half of the regional variation in producer yield within the NC USA region. Across the 10 TEDs, soybean average yield potential ranged from 3.3 to 5.3 Mgha\u22121 for rainfed fields and from 5.3 to 5.6Mgha\u22121 for irrigated fields. Highest producer yields in each TED were similar (\u00b112%) to the estimated yield potential. Yield gap, calculated as percentage of yield potential, was larger in rainfed (range: 15\u201328%) than in irrigated (range: 11\u201316%) soybean. Upscaled to the NC USA region, yield potential was 4.8Mgha\u22121 (rainfed) and 5.7Mgha\u22121 (irrigated), with a respective yield gap of 22 and 13% of yield potential. Sowing date, tillage, and in-season foliar fungicide and/or insecticide were identified as explanatory causes for yield variation in half or more of the 10 TEDs. However, the degree to which these three factors influenced producer yield varied across TEDs. Analysis of in-season weather helped interpret management\u00d7TED interactions. For example, yield increase due to advances in sowing date was greater in TEDs with less water limitation during the pod-setting phase. The present study highlights the strength of combining producer survey data with a spatial framework to measure yield gaps, identify management factors explaining these gaps, and understand the biophysical drivers influencing yield responses to crop management.", "Climate change, phenology, and phenological control of vegetation feedbacks to the climate system ": "Vegetation phenology is highly sensitive to climate change. Phenology also controls many feedbacks of vegetation to the climate system by influencing the seasonality of albedo, surface roughness length, canopy conductance, and fluxes of water, energy, CO2 and biogenic volatile organic compounds. In this review, we first discuss the environmental drivers of phenology, and the impacts of climate change on phenology, in different biomes. We then examine the vegetation-climate feedbacks that are mediated by phenology, and assess the potential impact on these feedbacks of shifts in phenology driven by climate change. We finish with an overview of phenological modeling and we suggest ways in which models might be improved using existing data sets. Several key weaknesses in our current understanding emerge from this analysis. First, we need a better understanding of the drivers of phenology, particularly in under-studied biomes (e.g. tropical forests). We do not have a mechanistic understanding of the role of photoperiod, even in well-studied biomes. In all biomes, the factors controlling senescence and dormancy are not well-documented. Second, for the most part (i.e. with the exception of phenology impacts on CO2 exchange) we have only a qualitative understanding of the feedbacks between vegetation and climate that are mediated by phenology. We need to quantify the magnitude of these feedbacks, and ensure that they are accurately reproduced by models. Third, we need to work towards a new understanding of phenological processes that enables progress beyond the modeling paradigms currently in use. Accurate representation of phenological processes in models that couple the land surface to the climate system is particularly important, especially when such models are being used to predict future climate.", "Response of crop yield to different time-scales of drought in the United States: Spatio-temporal patterns and climatic and environmental drivers ": "This article presents an analysis of the response of the annual crop yield in five main dryland cultivations in the United States to different time-scales of drought, and explores the environmental and climatic characteristics that determine the response. For this purpose we analysed barley, winter wheat, soybean, corn and cotton. Drought was quantified by means of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The results demonstrate a strong response in the interannual variability of crop yields to the drought time-scales in the different cultivations. Moreover, the response is highly spatially variable. Crop types showed considerable differences in the month in which their yields are most strongly linked to drought conditions. Some crops (e.g. winter wheat) responded to drought at medium to long SPEI time-scales, while other crops (e.g. soybean and corn) responded to short or long drought time-scales. The study confirms that the differences in the patterns of crop yield response to drought time-scales are mostly controlled by average climate conditions, in general, and water availability (precipitation), in particular. Generally, we found that there is a weaker link between crop yield and drought severity in humid environments and also that the response tends to occur over longer time-scales.", "Spatio-temporal downscaling of gridded crop model yield estimates based on machine learning ": "Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) are essential tools for estimating agricultural crop yields and externalities at large scales, typically at coarse spatial resolutions. Higher resolution estimates are required for robust agricultural assessments at regional and local scales, where the applicability of GGCMs is often limited by low data availability and high computational demand. An approach to bridge this gap is the application of meta-models trained on GGCM output data to covariates of high spatial resolution. In this study, we explore two machine learning approaches \u2013 extreme gradient boosting and random forests - to develop meta-models for the prediction of crop model outputs at fine spatial resolutions. Machine learning algorithms are trained on global scale maize simulations of a GGCM and exemplary applied to the extent of Mexico at a finer spatial resolution. Results show very high accuracy with R2>0.96 for predictions of maize yields as well as the hydrologic externalities evapotranspiration and crop available water with also low mean bias in all cases. While limited sets of covariates such as annual climate data alone provide satisfactory results already, a comprehensive set of predictors covering annual, growing season, and monthly climate data is required to obtain high performance in reproducing climate-driven inter-annual crop yield variability. The findings presented herein provide a first proof of concept that machine learning methods are highly suitable for building crop meta-models for spatio-temporal downscaling and indicate potential for further developments towards scalable crop model emulators.", "Improving leaf area index (LAI) estimation by correcting for clumping and woody effects using terrestrial laser scanning ": "Leaf area index (LAI) has frequently been measured in the field using traditional optical methods such as digital hemispherical photography (DHP). However, in the DHP retrieved LAI, there is always contribution of woody components due to the difficulty in distinguishing woody and foliar materials. In addition, the leaf angle distribution which strongly affects the estimation of LAI is either ignored while using the convergent angle 57.5\u00b0, or inversed simultaneously with LAI using multiple directions. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides a 3-dimensional view of the forest canopy, which we used in this study to improve LAI estimation by directly retrieving leaf angle distribution, and subsequently correcting foliage clumping and woody effects. The leaf angle distribution was retrieved by estimating the angle between the leaf normal vectors and the zenith vectors. The clumping index was obtained by using the gap size distribution method, while the woody contribution was evaluated based on an improved point classification between woody and foliar materials. Finally, the gap fraction derived from TLS was converted to effective LAI, and thence to LAI. The study was conducted for 31 forest plots including deciduous, coniferous and mixed plots in Bavarian Forest National Park. The classification accuracy was improved by approximately 10% using our method. Results showed that the clumping caused an underestimation of LAI ranging from 1.2% to 48.0%, while woody contribution led to an overestimation from 3.0% to 31.9% compared to the improved LAI. The combined error ranged from \u221246.2% to 32.6% of the leaf area index (LAI) measurements. The error was largely dependent on forest types. The clumping index of coniferous plots on average was lower than that of deciduous plots, whereas deciduous plots had a higher woody-to-total area ratio. The proposed method provides a more accurate estimate of LAI by eliminating clumping and woody effects, as well as the effect of leaf angle distribution.", "Mapping daily evapotranspiration over a large irrigation district from MODIS data using a novel hybrid dual-source coupling model ": "Accurate knowledge of spatially distributed evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for better understanding the availability and utilization of water resources. Over the past several decades, remote sensing (RS) technique has been widely applied to acquire indispensable input data for the estimation of ET at different spatial and temporal scales. Several dual-source ET models that can partition evaporation and transpiration have been developed by utilizing remote sensing data and ancillary meteorological observations. However, due to the significant spatial variability of air temperature over heterogeneous land surface, these models typically cannot be applied in heterogeneous regions with scarce meteorological observations. In the present study, a new model, referred to as the HTEM-ABL model, is developed by coupling the Hybrid dual-source scheme and Trapezoid framework-based ET Model (HTEM) with a simple atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model for ET estimation without ancillary air temperature observations. This model uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as the main input and is evaluated with field observations over a large irrigation district in North China. Results show that the HTEM-ABL model can be well applied to the study area, and the accuracy of HTEM-ABL model is slightly superior to the original HTEM model. The root mean square errors between the calculated and measured ET are 0.63 mm/day and 29.6 mm/year at the field scale and the regional scale, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated air temperature has been proved to be accurate qualitatively and quantitatively, and provides another aspect to evaluate the HTEM-ABL model. The spatial and temporal distributions of ET produced by the HTEM-ABL model are in good agreement with both the distribution of land use types and the variations of crop growth stages. In addition, the HTEM-ABL model shows less sensitivity to land surface temperature compared with the original HTEM model.", "Energy partitioning and evapotranspiration over a rotated paddy field in Southern China ": "There have been recent significant changes in crop rotation and irrigation methods in paddy fields in southern China. Examining the dynamics of energy exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) in rotated paddy fields is important for better understanding of land surface processes affected by human activities. In the present study, energy fluxes, including net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H) and soil heat flux (G) were investigated using two years (2016\u20132017) eddy covariance measurements from a rotated paddy field in southern China. The results showed that LE was the main consumer of Rn. Seasonal LE/Rn varied from 0.77 to 0.86 for the rice seasons, and from 0.48 to 0.51 for the milk vetch and fallow seasons. H showed an opposite seasonal trend with LE. G was higher during the milk vetch and fallow seasons because of the greater coverage of exposed soil. The high Priestley-Taylor coefficient (\u03b1, 1.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16) and decoupling factor (\u03a9, 0.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15) corroborated the energy-limited conditions for the rotated paddy field, indicating that Rn was the main meteorological factor governing ET. Canopy conductance (Gc) was closely related to \u03b1, suggesting that daily ET was significantly affected by Gc. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and leaf area index (LAI) played secondary roles in daily ET through their effects on Gc. ET was also affected by the wet and dry conditions of the paddy field. ET was slightly enhanced under dry conditions when LAI was low, while it decreased when LAI was large.", "The role of surface roughness, albedo, and Bowen ratio on ecosystem energy balance in the Eastern United States ": "Land cover and land use influence surface climate through differences in biophysical surface properties, including partitioning of sensible and latent heat (e.g., Bowen ratio), surface roughness, and albedo. Clusters of closely spaced eddy covariance towers (e.g., <10km) over a variety of land cover and land use types provide a unique opportunity to study the local effects of land cover and land use on surface temperature. We assess contributions albedo, energy redistribution due to differences in surface roughness and energy redistribution due to differences in the Bowen ratio using two eddy covariance tower clusters and the coupled (land-atmosphere) Variable-Resolution Community Earth System Model. Results suggest that surface roughness is the dominant biophysical factor contributing to differences in surface temperature between forested and deforested lands. Surface temperature of open land is cooler (\u22124.8\u00b0C to \u22120.05\u00b0C) than forest at night and warmer (+0.16\u00b0C to +8.2\u00b0C) during the day at northern and southern tower clusters throughout the year, consistent with modeled calculations. At annual timescales, the biophysical contributions of albedo and Bowen ratio have a negligible impact on surface temperature, however the higher albedo of snow-covered open land compared to forest leads to cooler winter surface temperatures over open lands (\u22120.4\u00b0C to \u22120.8\u00b0C). In both the models and observation, the difference in mid-day surface temperature calculated from the sum of the individual biophysical factors is greater than the difference in surface temperature calculated from radiative temperature and potential temperature. Differences in measured and modeled air temperature at the blending height, assumptions about independence of biophysical factors, and model biases in surface energy fluxes may contribute to daytime biases.", "Ear density estimation from high resolution RGB imagery using deep learning technique ": "Wheat ear density estimation is an appealing trait for plant breeders. Current manual counting is tedious and inefficient. In this study we investigated the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to provide accurate ear density using nadir high spatial resolution RGB images. Two different approaches were investigated, either using the Faster-RCNN state-of-the-art object detector or with the TasselNet local count regression network. Both approaches performed very well (rRMSE\u22486%) when applied over the same conditions as those prevailing for the calibration of the models. However, Faster-RCNN was more robust when applied to a dataset acquired at a later stage with ears and background showing a different aspect because of the higher maturity of the plants. Optimal spatial resolution for Faster-RCNN was around 0.3\u2009mm allowing to acquire RGB images from a UAV platform for high-throughput phenotyping of large experiments. Comparison of the estimated ear density with in-situ manual counting shows reasonable agreement considering the relatively small sampling area used for both methods. Faster-RCNN and in-situ counting had high and similar heritability (H\u00b2\u224885%), demonstrating that ear density derived from high resolution RGB imagery could replace the traditional counting method.", "Simulation of maize evapotranspiration: An inter-comparison among 29 maize models ": "Crop yield can be affected by crop water use and vice versa, so when trying to simulate one or the other, it can be important that both are simulated well. In a prior inter-comparison among maize growth models, evapotranspiration (ET) predictions varied widely, but no observations of actual ET were available for comparison. Therefore, this follow-up study was initiated under the umbrella of AgMIP (Agricultural Model Inter-Comparison and Improvement Project). Observations of daily ET using the eddy covariance technique from an 8-year-long (2006\u20132013) experiment conducted at Ames, IA were used as the standard for comparison among models. Simulation results from 29 models are reported herein. In the first \u201cblind\u201d phase for which only weather, soils, phenology, and management information were provided to the modelers, estimates of seasonal ET varied from about 200 to about 700\u2009mm. Subsequent three phases provided (1) leaf area indices for all years, (2) all daily ET and agronomic data for a typical year (2011), and (3) all data for all years, thus allowing the modelers to progressively calibrate their models as more information was provided, but the range among ET estimates still varied by a factor of two or more. Much of the variability among the models was due to differing estimates of potential evapotranspiration, which suggests an avenue for substantial model improvement. Nevertheless, the ensemble median values were generally close to the observations, and the medians were best (had the lowest mean squared deviations from observations, MSD) for several ET categories for inter-comparison, but not all. Further, the medians were best when considering both ET and agronomic parameters together. The best six models with the lowest MSDs were identified for several ET and agronomic categories, and they proved to vary widely in complexity in spite of having similar prediction accuracies. At the same time, other models with apparently similar approaches were not as accurate. The models that are widely used tended to perform better, leading us speculate that a larger number of users testing these models over a wider range of conditions likely has led to improvement. User experience and skill at calibration and dealing with missing input data likely were also a factor in determining the accuracy of model predictions. In several cases different versions of a model within the same family of models were run, and these within-family inter-comparisons identified particular approaches that were better while other factors were held constant. Thus, improvement is needed in many of the models with regard to their ability to simulate ET over a wide range of conditions, and several aspects for progress have been identified, especially in their simulation of potential ET.", "Forecasting crop yield using remotely sensed vegetation indices and crop phenology metrics ": "We used data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in association with county-level data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop empirical models predicting maize and soybean yield in the Central United States. As part of our analysis we also tested the ability of MODIS to capture inter-annual variability in yields. Our results show that the MODIS two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) provides a better basis for predicting maize yields relative to the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Inclusion of information related to crop phenology derived from MODIS significantly improved model performance within and across years. Surprisingly, using moderate spatial resolution data from the MODIS Land Cover Type product to identify agricultural areas did not degrade model results relative to using higher-spatial resolution crop-type maps developed by the USDA. Correlations between vegetation indices and yield were highest 65\u201375 days after greenup for maize and 80 days after greenup for soybeans. EVI2 was the best index for predicting maize yield in non-semi-arid counties (R\n                     2\n                     =0.67), but the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed better in semi-arid counties (R\n                     2\n                     =0.69), probably because the NDWI is sensitive to irrigation in semi-arid areas with low-density agriculture. NDVI and EVI2 performed equally well predicting soybean yield (R\n                     2\n                     =0.69 and 0.70, respectively). In addition, EVI2 was best able to capture large negative anomalies in maize yield in 2005 (R\n                     2\n                     =0.73). Overall, our results show that using crop phenology and a combination of EVI2 and NDWI have significant benefit for remote sensing-based maize and soybean yield models.", "ASPEN PLUS simulation model for CO2 removal with MEA: Validation of desorption model with experimental data ": "The chemical absorption process has been extensively studied as one of the main carbon capture and separation technologies. This process comprises two stages: The absorption of CO2 into the solvent and the desorption, to regenerate the solvent and produce the high concentrated CO2 gas.\n                  Validated simulation models are essential for the scale-up of the chemical absorption process and they are typically validated using only data from one pilot plant. In this work, a simulation model of the desorption column built in ASPEN PLUS v8.6 was validated using four experimental pilot campaigns using 30wt% MEA. The desorbers in the different campaigns varied in the diameters, structured packing heights and packing types.\n                  A good agreement is observed between experimental data and the simulation results of the chemical absorption process presented here. The model shows an AARD (average absolute relative deviation) of 9.2% for the CO2 stripped (kg/h) for the tested 78 experimental runs. The simulated temperatures of the liquid flux leaving the reboiler show a deviation of 3.3% compared with the experimental data. The deviations on the estimation of the CO2 stripped show some dependency on the CO2 loading in the rich amine flux entering the desorber. However, the deviations are independent on the temperature of the rich amine.", "Prevalence of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in a wastewater effluent-receiving river in the Netherlands ": "Antibiotics are being used intensively for humans and livestock worldwide and have led to the presence of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as a point source for ARB&Gs, and water catchments consequently are potential receptors of ARB&Gs. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of antibiotics (macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines), ARGs (ermB, sul1, sul2, tetW), and class 1 integron (targeting the integrase gene), in a Dutch river that receives wastewater treatment plant effluent. Sediment and water samples were collected during one year along the river. The WWTP significantly increased the amounts of antibiotics and ARGs in the river as compared to the upstream samples, of which the antibiotics decreased once they entered the river. ARGs were persistent in the water and sediment from the WWTP effluent discharge point until 20\u202fkm downstream. This study provides insight in the prevalence of antibiotics and ARGs in a wastewater effluent-receiving river system in the Netherlands. Even though human antibiotic usage is low in the Netherlands, antibiotics, residues of antibiotics, and ARGs are detected in the river surface water-sediment system, which shows that a river has the potential to act as a reservoir of ARGs.", "Recent advances in photocatalysis for environmental applications ": "Advanced Oxidation technologies (AOTs) are gaining attention as an effective waste water treatment methodology capable of degrading diverse spectrum of recalcitrant organic contaminants and microbes. Undoubtedly, photocatalysis is a promising AOT to alleviate the problem of water pollution. Despite recent research into other photocatalysts (e.g. ZnO, ZnS, Semiconductor-Graphene composites, perovskites, MoS2, WO3 and Fe2O3), titanium dioxide (TiO2) remains the most popular photocatalyst due to its low cost, nontoxicity and high oxidising ability. Moreover, titania photocatalysts can easily be immobilized on various surfaces and be scaled up for large scale water treatment. The current review aims to highlight recent advancements in photocatalytic AOTs with main emphasis on TiO2 photocatalysis. This review also discusses the use of TiO2 photocatalysis for water and waste treatment, treating contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), pesticides, endocrine disrupters (EDs) and bacteria using both UV and visible light irradiations. It was concluded that with efficient photoreactor configuration and further studies on the photocatalyst regeneration, TiO2 photocatalysis is a viable option for the reclamation of agricultural/irrigational waste water. Novel doped photocatalysts such as ZnS-CuS-CdS, carbon spheres/CdS, g-C3N4-Au-CdS, ZnS-WS2-CdS, C3N4-CdS and Pd-Cr2O3-CdS have also been discussed. Finally, the advances in the actively studied metal organic framework based photocatalysts that are emerging as effective alternate for metal oxide based photocatalysts is also discussed in detail.", "Efficiency of various recent wastewater dye removal methods: A review ": "Dye effluents released from numerous dye-utilizing industries are harmful towards the environment and living things. Consequently, existence of dye effluent in environmental water bodies is becoming a growing concern to environmentalists and civilians. A long term sustainable and efficient dye effluent treatment method should be established to eliminate this issue. Dye wastewater should be treated first before release to minimize its negative impacts towards the environment and living things. However, due to lack of information on efficient dye removal methods, it is difficult to decide on a single technique that resolves the prevailing dye effluent issue. Therefore, this paper reviews existing research papers on various biological, chemical and physical dye removal methods to find its efficiency through percentage of dye removal. Although there are numerous existing tried and tested methods to accomplish dye removal, most of them have a common disadvantage which is the generation of secondary pollution to the environment. This paper highlights enzyme degradation (biological) and adsorption (physical) dye removal as these are known as one of the most efficient dye removal techniques these days. This paper also suggests the usage of a combined adsorbent as it is envisioned that this technique has better efficiency and is able to remove dyes at a faster rate.", "Removal of cadmium from wastewaters with low-cost adsorbents ": "Instead of using commercial activated carbon or ion exchange resins, researchers have worked on inexpensive materials, such as wastes from industry and agricultural operations due to their outstanding adsorption behavior toward heavy metal ions. Low-cost adsorbents are easily and locally available in large quantities. The modification of these materials could considerably increase their sorption capacity. In this review, the technical feasibility of various low-cost adsorbents for removal of Cd(II) from wastewaters has been discussed. Due to widespread cadmium contamination and its toxicity, there is considerable interest to remove it before discharge into wastewater streams. Several factors affecting an adsorption process such as pH, contact time as well as the reported maximum adsorption capacity values are summarized. The subsequent regeneration and reuse of adsorbents has been given considerable attention and some adsorption studies using real wastewater samples were also discussed.", "A review on Fenton-like processes for organic wastewater treatment ": "Fenton-like processes have been studied widely in recent years and are considered promising for organic wastewater treatment.

Especially, the water pollution is growing rapidly due to the wastewater discharge from the industries. The only way to find the new water resource is the reuse of treated wastewater. Several remediation technologies are available which provides a convenience to reuse the reclaimed wastewater. Heavy metals like Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd, Hg, etc. contributes various environmental problems based on their toxicity. These toxic metals are exposed to human and environment, the accumulation of ions takes place which causes serious health and environmental hazards. Hence, it is a major concern in the environment. Due to this concern, the significance of developing technology for removing heavy metals has been increased. This paper contributes the outline of new literature with two objectives. First, it provides the sketch about treatment technologies followed by their heavy metal capture capacity from industrial effluent. The treatment performance, their remediation capacity and probable environmental and health impacts were deliberated in this review article.

However, the issue associated with traditional biodiesel production is the expensive production cost on the industrial scale, mainly contributed by the raw materials. Therefore, catalyst plays an important role with the purpose to speed up the overall biodiesel production rate and minimizing the production cost. Over the course, numerous researches have been done on various types of catalyst in biodiesel production. Henceforth, this review comprises of a comprehensive overview of biodiesel production by discussing the latest trends, that utilizes biomass waste-derived biochar catalyst. Apart from that, the focus of this review will be on magnetic catalyst (derived from both biomass and non-biomass) used in biodiesel synthesis whereby the magnetic catalyst synthesis method and characterisation, as well as compilation of experimental data of different literatures on using magnetic catalyst will be included in the framework of this paper. Moreover, the magnetic catalyst reusability studies are also highlighted in this review. Application of biomass-based magnetic catalyst in biodiesel production may be one of the solutions to overcome the catalyst separation issue and to further the development of economically feasible biodiesel industry and ultimately, transforming the current energy options into a greener and more sustainable sources of energy.", "The mechanism of the spontaneous detonation of ammonium nitrate in reactive grounds ": "The mechanism of the decomposition of ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and of ammonium nitrate (AN) emulsions has been investigated. The formation of NO gas bubbles at the end of an induction period was observed, which led to the evolution of brown NO2 gas on contact with air. Inhibition of the decomposition reaction could be achieved by reducing the NO concentration in the gas phase, with inhibitors not in physical contact with the reaction mixture. NO adsorbing clay minerals (hydrotalcite) were effective inhibitors, indicating multiple mechanisms of inhibition. A central role is assigned to nitrous acid (HNO2): sequestering NO prevents its formation, base inhibitors keep it in the non-reactive form of the nitrite ion (pKa of HNO2\n                     \u223c3), and urea in acidic conditions decomposes it to harmless N2. Our results have implications in industries where NOx emissions can cause significant environmental problems for both aquatic and marine life as well as for human health.", "A review on Fenton and improvements to the Fenton process for wastewater treatment ": "The increase in the disposal of refractory organics demands for newer technologies for the complete mineralization of these wastewaters. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) constitute a promising technology for the treatment of such wastewaters and this study presents a general review on such processes developed to decolorize and/or degrade organic pollutants. Fundamentals and main applications of typical methods such as Fenton, electro-Fenton, photo-Fenton, sono-Fenton, sono-photo-Fenton, sono-electro-Fenton and photo-electro-Fenton are discussed. This review also highlights the application of nano-zero valent iron in treating refractory compounds.", "Trends in CO2 conversion and utilization: A review from process systems perspective ": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) community has been struggling over the past few decades to demonstrate the economic feasibility of CO2 sequestration. Nevertheless, in practice, it has only proven feasible under conditions with a market for the recovered CO2, such as in the beverage industry or enhanced oil/gas recovery. The research community and industry are progressively converging to a conclusion that CO2 sequestration has severe limitations for the value proposition. Alternatively, creating diverse demand markets and revenue streams for the recovered almost-pure CO2 may prevail over CO2 sequestration option and improve the economic feasibility of this climate change mitigation approach. As such, research in the carbon capture and management field is seen to be shifting towards CO2 utilization, directly and indirectly, in energy and chemical industries.\n                  In this paper, we have critically reviewed the literature on carbon capture, conversion, and utilization routes and assessed the progress in the research and developments in this direction.

The variety of applications of TiO2 as a photocatalyst has been taken place because of low operating temperature, biologically inert nature, low energy consumption, water insolubility, ease availability and photoactivity, less toxicity, high chemical stability, suitable flat band potential, narrow band gap and environmentally benign. The successful and efficient application of photocatalysis depends on quality of photocatalyst, nature of pollutants, and source of light, which should be in close contact with each other. The TiO2 photocatalyst is used for the effluent treatment of textile wastewater in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Heterogeneous UV-TiO2 photocatalysis is capable to remove organic pollutants from textile wastewater, which has been widely studied and the technology also being commercialized in many developing countries in the world. This review focuses on the mechanism of UV-TiO2 photocatalysis, modification of TiO2 photocatalyst, and application of doping and co-doping in order to improve the photocatalytic activity in wastewater treatment.

This enzyme was isolated and purified from the bioremediation products of textile wastewater containing direct green azo dye in a UFC/CSA prototype bioreactor. To improve the enzyme stability, efficiency and recyclability, peroxidase was immobilized on Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles produced and modified by co-precipitation using glutaraldehyde. The immobilized enzyme was characterized by transmission electron microscopy analysis and examined against different pH as well as storage time and temperatures. The MNPs-immobilized peroxidise was remarkable stable towards temperature and pH perturbations, compared to the free enzyme form. Moreover, the immobilized peroxidase maintained its full activity upon storage at 4 and 25\u2009\u00b0C for 90 days, and upon recycling for up to 100 cycles. Finally, the MNPs-immobilized peroxidase was successfully employed to decolorize dyes of different chemical natures in a lab scale bioreactor. Hence, we believe that the immobilized peroxidase on magnetic nanoparticles reported in this work can be potentially used in various industrial and environmental applications.", "Potential and challenges of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in dye wastewater treatment: A review ": "Enzymes are known to catalyze reactions at high efficiency, operate at milder conditions and are biodegradable. Due to enzyme limitations such as sensitivity to environmental conditions, enzyme immobilization is often used. The commonly employed immobilization methods include adsorption, entrapment, covalent attachment and cross-linking. Many research works have now focused on the immobilization of enzymes on nanoscale support due to the higher surface area to volume ratio, effective enzyme loading, significantly enhanced mass transfer efficiency and minimization of diffusional problems. The application of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in the treatment of dye wastewater is thus, of high interest. Therefore, this paper has critically reviewed (1) the current technologies available for dye wastewater treatment; (2) different methods utilized for enzyme immobilization; and (3) the application and performance of enzyme incorporated nanotechnology for dye wastewater treatment. We identified that there is high potential for enzyme incorporated nanotechnology to be implemented in dye wastewater treatment due to the high decolorization performance (e.g. laccase immobilized on Fe3O4/SiO2 nanoparticles achieved 99% decolorization of Procion Red MX-5B in 20\u202fmin). We have also identified the key challenges faced by enzyme incorporated nanotechnology in dye wastewater treatment that includes: (i) realization of lab scale experiments to industrial applications; (ii) lack of understanding of enzymes incorporated nanotechnology; (iii) recovery of immobilized enzyme; (iv) synthesis of hybrid nanoflowers; and (v) sustainability of the nanomaterials used.", "Acid mine drainage: Challenges and opportunities ": "Acid mine drainage (AMD) or acid rock drainage (ARD) is considered as one of the main pollutants of water in many countries that have historic or current mining activities. Its generation, release, mobility, and attenuation involves complex processes governed by a combination of physical, chemical, and biological factors. In general, AMD is produced by the oxidative dissolution of sulphide minerals. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of AMD. It critically analyses the work performed in recent years on its occurrence, effects (on human health, plant life and aquatic species), and summarizes the remediation approaches taken so far to overcome the problem of AMD. The challenges faced in tackling the remediation of AMD have also been considered. Commercially developed projects that are either in operation, being piloted or under evaluation have also been discussed.

The effect of ferrous ions (Fe2+), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and pH was evaluated. Complete degradation was achieved within 12\u2009min of reaction time under the optimized conditions of Fe2+- 30\u2009mg/l, H2O2 \u2013 375\u2009mg/l, and pH\u2009\u2013\u20093.0 during Fenton\u2019s process. Efficiency towards degradation of AMX was enhanced when the Fenton\u2019s process was coupled with UV- light illumination, solar light illumination, and UV light-Ultrasound treatment. Complete degradation was observed within 3.5\u2009min and 9\u2009min during the photo-Fenton and solar photo-Fenton process, respectively. The sono-Fenton process takes a longer time to degrade AMX than other processes while sono-photo-Fenton process degrades AMX within 6\u2009min. The reason for a reduced rate of degradation of AMX in the sono-Fenton process may be attributed to the competition of ultrasound and Fenton for H2O2, which ultimately decreases Fenton reagent in the process. The study concluded that the Fenton process coupled with other UV/solar light is more efficient than the stand-alone Fenton process towards degradation of AMX.", "\n               Shorea robusta derived activated carbon decorated with manganese dioxide hybrid composite for improved capacitive behaviors ": "Shorea robusta derived activated carbon decorated with MnO2 was successfully prepared.

However, when applied in slurry form, agglomeration of nanoparticle will lead to serious decrease in photocatalytic performance due to hinderance effect. By combining the photocatalyst and adsorbents, which is designated as integrated photocatalyst adsorbent (IPCA), an adsorbent material which also degrades toxic organic compounds in the presence of UV/visible light irradiation could be produced. The compound does not only preserve all the interesting characteristics of both individual components, but also overcomes serious drawbacks, such as low absorptivity, rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and hinderance effect of photocatalyst when applied in slurry form. There are several criteria that must be obeyed by the absorbent material used such as high absorption capacity to target compound, reasonable transparency to UV\u2013vis light, high surface area, inhibition of photocatalyst leaching and good stability with dispersing solvent. In this review article, the authors presented an overview on the application of photocatalyst, adsorbents and integrated photocatalyst adsorbents for wastewater treatment. Moreover, the discussions were also focused on the major adsorbent which has been integrated with photocatalyst such as carbon, clays, zeolite matrix materials and others.

X-ray diffraction studies indicated the formation of wurtzite hexagonal phase for ZnO, monoclinic for CuO and FCC structure for silver nanocomposites. The surface morphology of nanoparticles were studied using FESEM. FTIR studies confirmed the presence of silver & M\u2013O bonds. UV\u2013vis DRS studies revealed that silver doping reduced the band-gap energy which overcomes fast recombination rate of electron-hole pairs of the nanoparticles. TGA studies indicated enhanced thermal stability of doped nanocomposites. Hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with NaBH4 showed that Ag/ZnO & Ag/CuO exhibited greater photoreduction capacity than undoped ZnO & CuO. ZnO, Ag/ZnO, CuO & Ag/CuO nanocomposites have antagonistic effect on the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus with greater inhibition zones. Ag/CuO NPs exhibited the highest sensitivity against various bacterial strains with MIC below 1\u2009mg. Ag/CuO nanorods showed excellent adsorption properties with high removal capacity of MG of about 90%. Kinetic, thermodynamic and equilibrium studies on adsorption of MG onto Ag/CuO nanorods was carried out. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO and Ag/ZnO nanocomposites was investigated by studying the degradation of methylene blue & malachite green under UV irradiation.

A study of the performance of an electro-Fenton reactor ": "The electro-Fenton degradation of Triclosan in aqueous solution was studied using a cylindrical reactor in which polarized carbon cloth electrodes and a cation exchange resin were employed. Using a factorial design of experiments approach, the effect of four variables (considering two levels for each one), was measured on four response parameters that reflect the electrooxidation efficiency of the electrochemical reactor. The results revealed that in all cases triclosan degradation was very efficient (above 95%) and that while there is a reasonable effect of all variables and their interactions, the one with the strongest influence on the process is the nature and magnitude of the ionic strength of the electrolytic solution. In this way, while the presence of a buffer species in this solution can keep the pH in a value that affects the generation of \u2022OH radicals from the Fenton mixture, a high ionic strength solution can promote the elimination of Fe ionic species from the reactor by decreasing resin Fe retention due to competition effects of other ions for the binding sites of the substrate. HPLC experiments of the effluent solutions, also revealed that the degradation by-products of triclosan were dependent on the nature and ionic strength of the electrolytic solution in the electro-Fenton process under study. Finally, comparison of the different operation modes, also suggested that electro-adsorption of Fe cationic species in the negatively polarized cathode surface, is the main factor that controls Fe ion retention within the reactor.", "Pre-treatment and anaerobic digestion of food waste for high rate methane production \u2013 A review ": "Food waste with high decomposition potential can be successfully digested anaerobically for the production of biogas. As the fossil-fuel reserves decline anaerobic digestion can be a better alternative as a renewable energy source. The byproducts such as biogas with 50\u201360% methane content can be efficiently used for electricity production and the final digested sludge as a fertilizer. Even though anaerobic digestion is a proven technology, still there exist some technical difficulties (organic loading rate, solid retention time, biogas composition, specific gas production) and scientific understandings (carbon to nitrogen ratio, volatile fatty acids production, pH variation, nutrient concentration) in operating reactors for solid organic wastes. First the paper gives an overview of certain fundamental aspects of anaerobic digestion considered important for the digestion of food waste and its biochemical reactions. Then it describes food waste as the substrate for anaerobic digestion and its optimal conditions for the increased activity of biogas production. Finally it has been reviewed about the performance of the different pre-treatment methods and anaerobic reactor configurations in the digestion of food waste for increasing methane content in the biogas.", "Flocculation: An effective way to harvest microalgae for biodiesel production ": "Microalgae are considered the most suitable feedstock for biodiesel production due to their higher areal productivity and lipid content. The economical production of biofuels from microalgae is important. This paper is a review of different techniques used for flocculating microalgae such as use of inorganic salts, organic salts, bioflocculants, autoflocculation and electrolytic flocculation for harvesting microalgae for biodiesel production. It was found that the usage of natural flocculants for harvesting microalgae eliminates the toxicity of biomass harvested but the cost of flocculant makes it uneconomical for large scale applications. The economic method of harvesting large quantity of microalgae still requires further research and development.", "Effect of physicochemical and biological parameters on the quality of river water of Narmada, Madhya Pradesh, India ": "Narmada River is considered to be the holy river of the state Madhya Pradesh.

Three methods (Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index, National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index and Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index) were used for calculation of water quality index. This was observed that the water quality was found to be excellent to good in the season summer and winter and poor to unsuitable for human consumption in the season monsoon along the river Narmada. The fall in the quality of water in monsoon season was due to poor sanitation, turbulent flow, soil erosion and high anthropogenic activities.", "Participation of Water Users Associations in Gash spate system management, Sudan ": "Water Users Associations (WUAs) have been introduced in Gash Delta Agricultural Scheme (GDAS) in 2004. The level of participation and performance of these associations have been influenced by many factors. The purpose of this paper is to measure the level of participation and to identify the factors influences the performance of WUAs in GDAS in eastern part of Sudan. Field visits, questionnaires, and focus group discussions were conducted during 2013/2014 crop season. The participation of farmers was classified to full, average, less and no participation. The results indicated that WUAs fully participate in water distribution and clearance of agricultural land. It is found that WUAs partially participate in provision of finance, seeds, attend flooding time and report water breakages. WUAs less participate in maintaining of bonds and not yet contribute in mapping of wetland. The results also indicated that WUAs have influenced by the lack of cooperation with other related institutions working in GDAS. The obtained results will contribute in improvement of participatory spate system management.", "Modeling and simulation of a micro grid-connected solar PV system ": "In 2012, the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy (MERE); began promoting the system of \u2018Feed-in Tariff\u2019 in billing. The introduced system allows the user to generate electricity through solar panels mounted on the roofs of residential buildings and governmental organizations and tied to the grid. To benefit from MERE\u2019s approach, the National Water Research Center (NWRC) (Qanatir, Egypt) set up a pilot rooftop 91kW PV system. All the generated electricity is fed into the 220V, 50Hz low voltage grid serving NWRC premises. In this manuscript a MATLAB Simulink model is constructed mimicking a detailed representation of the system tied either to the local low voltage grid or to the national high voltage grid. The aim of such modeling effort is to provide early evaluation of the system performance. The economical savings of both scenarios are compared based on the new billing system. Results show that the current system saves 100 thousand L.E./year, while tying the system to the national grid will save 235.8 thousand L.E./year.", "Modeling of discharge and sediment transport through the SWAT model in the basin of Harraza (Northwest of Algeria) ": "The objective of this study is to model discharge and solid erosion quantification through a small agricultural watershed by applying the SWAT model (Soil and Water Assessment Tools) on the Wadi Harraza\u2019s basin of which is part of Wadi Cheliff\u2019s basin, with an average altitude of 500m, drains an area of 568sqkm. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT, version 2009) model integrated with Geographic Information System (ArcGIS, version 10.0) were used to simulate the discharge and sediment concentration of Wadi Harraza\u2019s basin for the period from 2004 to 2009. Model calibration and validation were performed for monthly time periods using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting 2 (SUFI-2, version 2) within SWAT-CUP. Our calibration and validation outputs for monthly simulation showed a good model performance for discharges. Thus the evolution of the average total annual sediment in the Wadi Harraza\u2019s basin which will be deposited in the Wadi Cheliff, is estimated at 54.24tha\u22121.", "Removal of pathogenic bacteria from wastewater using silver nanoparticles synthesized by two fungal species ": "Nanotechnology are fast advancing and currently became more effective than the conventional technologies used in water treatment that offers safe opportunities for using unconventional water supply sources. Fungi are more versatile in growth and metal tolerance in contrast to bacterial population. This work aims to demonstrate the extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticle by using two filamentous fungi Penciillium Citreonigum Dierck and Scopulaniopsos brumptii Salvanet-Duval isolated from Lake Burullus, examine the biosynthesized nano-silver particles by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The functional group of protein molecules surrounding AgNPs was identified using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. Check the antibacterial activity of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles at two concentrations (550.7 and 676.9mg/l) and interact it with bacteria for different durations (15, 60 and 120min). Polyurethane foam was used as silver carrier and nano-silver solution for the removal of pathogenic bacteria in polluted water. The synthesized AgNPs showed an excellent antibacterial property on gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains.", "Characterization of groundwater quality using water evaluation indices, multivariate statistics and geostatistics in central Bangladesh ": "This study investigates the groundwater quality in the Faridpur district of central Bangladesh based on preselected 60 sample points. Water evaluation indices and a number of statistical approaches such as multivariate statistics and geostatistics are applied to characterize water quality, which is a major factor for controlling the groundwater quality in term of drinking purposes. The study reveal that EC, TDS, Ca2+, total As and Fe values of groundwater samples exceeded Bangladesh and international standards. Ground water quality index (GWQI) exhibited that about 47% of the samples were belonging to good quality water for drinking purposes. The heavy metal pollution index (HPI), degree of contamination (C\n                     d), heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) reveal that most of the samples belong to low level of pollution. However, C\n                     d provide better alternative than other indices. Principle component analysis (PCA) suggests that groundwater quality is mainly related to geogenic (rock\u2013water interaction) and anthropogenic source (agrogenic and domestic sewage) in the study area. Subsequently, the findings of cluster analysis (CA) and correlation matrix (CM) are also consistent with the PCA results. The spatial distributions of groundwater quality parameters are determined by geostatistical modeling. The exponential semivariagram model is validated as the best fitted models for most of the indices values. It is expected that outcomes of the study will provide insights for decision makers taking proper measures for groundwater quality management in central Bangladesh.", "Simulating streamflow in an ungauged catchment of Tonlesap Lake Basin in Cambodia using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model ": "The study objective of this work is to test the applicability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate the streamflow through calibration and validation for both daily and monthly basis in the Stung Pursat River catchment, an ungauged sub-catchment of Tonle Sap Basin in Cambodia. In order to achieve the objective of the study, SWAT model was set up with study period of 10 years (2001\u20132010). Additionally, ArcSWAT2012 and ArcGIS10.2.2 combined with Sequential Uncertainty Fitting-2 (SUFI-2) algorithms were used to conduct uncertainty analysis, calibration and validation of the SWAT model using daily observed streamflow data at the catchment outlet. Daily simulation produced the results with Nash-Sutcliffe Simulation Efficiency (NSE) of 0.38, Percent Bias (PBIAS) of +5.1% and Root Mean square error-observation standard deviation Ratio (RSR) of 0.79 in calibration period, and with NSE of \u22126.61, PBIAS of \u221278.38% and RSR of 2.67 in validation period. The streamflow results of monthly time series were improved and acceptable with NSE of 0.60 while decrease the value of PBIAS and RSR to 1.14, and 0.63 respectively. The SWAT model should be used to simulate monthly streamflow in such an ungauged catchment like the Stung Pursat catchment due to data scarcity and uncertainty.", "Evaluation of heavy metal contamination using environmetrics and indexing approach for River Yamuna, Delhi stretch, India ": "The objective of the present study is to investigate the current status of heavy metal pollution in River Yamuna, Delhi stretch. The concentrations of Nickel, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, and Zinc in water samples have been studied during December 2013\u2013August 2015. The overall mean concentration of heavy metals was observed in the following order Fe>Cu>Zn>Ni>Cr>Pb>Cd. Correlation analysis formed two distinct groups of heavy metals highlighting similar sources. This was further corroborated by results from principal components analysis that showed similar grouping of heavy metals (Ni, Zn, Fe, Pb, Cd) into PC1 having one common source for these heavy metals and PC2 (Cu, Cr) having another common source. Further, our study pointed out two sites i.e. Najafgarh drain and Shahdara drain outlet in river Yamuna as the two potential sources responsible for the heavy metal contamination. Based on heavy metal pollution index value (1491.15), we concluded that our study area as a whole is critically polluted with heavy metals under study due to pollutant load from various anthropogenic activities.", "A DPSIR-analysis of water uses and related water quality issues in the Colombian Alto and Medio Dagua Community Council ": "A portion of Colombia\u2019s water resources is located on the Pacific coast within the territory of the Community Council of Alto and Medio Dagua (CC-AMDA). Though a harmonious balance between the communities\u2019 subsistent activities and nature was maintained for centuries, the appearance of modern modes of resource extraction has negatively affected the environment, especially the water resources. The Driver-Pressure-State- Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to analyze water quality problems within this community council. The DPSIR analysis revealed that agriculture, mining, logging and infrastructure development constitute important sectoral drivers with some contribution from tourism and fisheries. Pressures included inputs of organic matter, sediment, nutrients and chemical contaminants to the Dagua river, and to the Bay of Buenaventura. These produced corresponding State changes in the water bodies. Impacts on human welfare were poor public health, reduced food and water security, economic loss and some displacement. Societal Responses included public protests and campaigns, legal actions and policy changes for improved governance. As a future policy option, the formation of community-based water resources management is recommended. Though DPSIR was able to link cause-effect relations, further empirical research on these water bodies is necessary to fill in existing gaps in the data set, particularly for public health threatening contaminants.", "Wastewater treatment in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands using different media (setup stage) ": "Wastewater treatment through horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands (CWs) using three different treatment media (gravel, pieces of plastic pipes, and shredded tire rubber chips) were investigated in Samaha village, Dakahliya, Egypt. The study focused on the wetland setup stage during the first months of its operation (setup stage). In this stage media porosity, bacterial biofilm, and plant roots growth were in progress and it was prior to the operational steady state stage. Objectives of this paper are to study the change in media porosity of HSSF wetland cells in order to estimate duration of wetland setup stage, and to evaluate the use of different bed media on biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) treatment. The results showed that after 180 days of operation, the wetland cells had reached steady porosity and had started stable treatment. Also performance of plastic media bed in pollutants reduction was better than gravel and rubber beds and gravel media was in advanced than rubber media.", "Improved concrete properties to resist the saline water using environmental by-product ": "This paper investigates the influence of using environmental by-product materials (silica fume and fly ash) in concrete on the chloride ion permeability of concrete. Nine concrete mixtures were designed to have the same degree of workability and air content with water/cementitious material ratio of 0.4. The studied parameters include the main fresh and hardened concrete properties such as slump, air content, unit weight, compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, static Young's modulus, and dynamic elastic modulus. Concrete samples were kept in water for 28 days, then immersed in artificial sea water for 5 months. The total and soluble chloride contents were measured through the concrete using the potentiometric titration analysis. The obtained test results indicated that the use of ternary systems in concrete improved the different characteristics of the product concrete and showed a significant resistance to chloride penetration. The weights of chloride in mix 9 (10% silica fume and 25% fly ash) at depths from the concrete surface to 30mm were less than the weights of control mix 1 (100% ordinary Portland cement) by about 60%. Further, the ternary systems can be used in concrete industry with considerable proportions.", "Studies on high iron content in water resources of Moradabad district (UP), India ": "In India, the district of Moradabad lies between 28\u00b021\u2032 to 28\u00b016\u2032 north latitude and 78\u00b04\u2032 to 79\u00b0 east longitude in western Uttar Pradesh. The city is known for its export of brass handicrafts to various countries across the world including North America and Europe and is also known as Peetal Nagri (Brass City). A field survey was conducted in district Moradabad along with a public interaction program on water related problems. A total of 108 representative villages covering all eight blocks of Moradabad district were visited and interactions were held with the local population to find out the status of drinking water quality and associated problems. The previous studies on surface and groundwater quality assessment of Moradabad district did not cover the entire area or present the water quality awareness amongst the local population despite of the repeatedly complains about the yellow colour of water.\n                  Water quality of surface and groundwater has been assessed with respect to metal concentration using ICP-OES technique. Out of the 64 water samples collected, copper, arsenic, lead and chromium concentrations were always within the permissible limits. While iron concentration, more than 50% of the samples were beyond permissible limit. Maximum iron level in groundwater sample was 3820ppb and that in surface water sample was 6294ppb whereas the permissible limit is 300ppb.\n                  The overload of iron may cause severe health problems such as liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis of liver, diseases related to heart and central nervous system, infertility etc. The presence of high concentration of iron leads to adverse changes in colour, odour and taste of water and it also stains clothes and utensils. However, the local health authority's records are not available.", "Aquatic environmental monitoring and removal efficiency of detergents ": "In this study, the detergent's concentrations in aquatic environment principally drinking and surface water along River Nile and near rural village were determined to report the influence of different physicochemical characteristics on the distribution of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) that lead to toxicity in human beings. The removal efficiency of LAS using zeolite and granular activated carbon technique was assessed.\n                  The results showed wide variations observed between surface (0.07\u20130.38mgLAS/l) and bottom water (0.05\u20130.17mgLAS/l) due to increase in population density and human activities that recorded highest concentration along rural area (surface: 1.24\u20132.45 and bottom: 0.93\u20131.083mgLAS/l). Low concentration of surfactants was found in drinking water (0.005\u20130.007mgLAS/l) compared to the concentration of the corresponding water samples along the River Nile. In conclusion, the study indicated that the treatment processes for drinking water production were insufficient for the complete removal of surfactants and adsorption process by using zeolite as low cost, most beneficial, economically feasible method as well as easy to operate for producing high quality of water.", "Validation method of organochlorine pesticides residues in water using gas chromatography\u2013quadruple mass ": "In analytical chemistry laboratories, it is critical to have a sensitive method to provide applicable qualitative and quantitative data.

The adsorption of heavy metals was investigated under various pH values ranged from 2 to 8 at 25\u00b0C. The obtained results indicate that at low pH (2\u20134), the removal efficiency of diatomite for heavy metal increased slightly as the pH, adsorbent dose and contact time increased, while at pH>4, the percentage of metal ions adsorbed decreased with increasing pH due to precipitation of heavy metals. At pH equal 4, with using 2gL\u22121 of diatomite and 75min as contact time, the maximum adsorption capacity of diatomite was obtained. The high adsorption capacity of diatomite makes it a suitable low cost material for the removal of different heavy metals from aqueous solutions.", "Impact Resistance of Rubberized Self-Compacting Concrete ": "Impact loads due to ship collision on irrigation structures is significantly decreasing their durability. Loss of material and degradation are quite common problems facing lock walls and piers. In the current research, rubberized self-compacting concrete (SCC) was used to investigate problems associated with impact. SCC with cement kiln dust cement replacement was used for that purpose. Concrete specimens were prepared with different crumb rubber ratios of 10% (RSCC-10), 20% (RSCC-20), 30% (RSCC-30), and 40% (RSCC-40) sand replacement by volume. Standard compressive, flexure, and splitting strength tests were conducted to monitor the effect of the added rubber on concrete behavior. Moreover, impact testing program was applied to specific specimens, cylinder of diameter 200mm and thickness 50mm, according to ACI committee 544 procedures. The number of blows to first and ultimate cracks was determined. The relationship between the mechanical properties and impact resilience is also presented. With the increase in rubber percentage the resistance to impact increased, but there was a decrease in specimen strength and modulus of elasticity. The variation in results was discussed and mix RSCC-30 exhibited the best impact resistance, 3 times over control mix with 40% reduction of compressive strength.", "Additional stresses on buildings induced by vibration effects ": "Construction activities, blasting and traffic are the main sources of ground vibrations that may have a detrimental effect on buildings.\n                  The main objective of this research is to study the relationship between additional stresses on building induced by vibrations, vibration nature and building dynamic characteristics.\n                  Five numerical models were subjected to base excitation to represent different vibration sources and wave forms. These waves were scaled to the same peak acceleration.\n                  Experimental dynamic tests were carried out using five physical models with different characteristics. These models were subjected to different types of vibration. The vibration characteristics were identified and the models top acceleration responses were measured. Moreover, the models maximum stresses were measured due to each vibration load.\n                  The relationships between stress increasing, fundamental period and base excitation type were plotted; also the relationship between pseudo acceleration response at the top of the building and the frequency ratio between the model fundamental frequency and the base excitation predominant frequency was also plotted. These relations were analyzed and concluded to tangible results.", "Improving accuracy of downscaling rainfall by combining predictions of different statistical downscale models ": "A flexible framework of multi-model of three statistical downscaling approaches was established in which predictions from these models were used as inputs to Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Traditional ANN, Simple Average Method (SAM), and combining models (SDSM, Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR), Generalized Linear Model (GLM)) were applied to a studied site in North-western England. Model performance criteria of each of the primary and combining models were evaluated. The obtained results indicate that different downscaling methods can gain diverse usefulness and weakness in simulating various rainfall characteristics under different circumstances. The combining ANN model showed more adaptability by acquiring better overall performance, while GLM, MLR and showed comparable results and the SDSM reveals relatively less accurate results in modelling most of the rainfall amount. Furthermore traditional ANN has been tested and showed poor performance in reproducing the observed rainfall compared with above methods. The results also show that the superiority of the combining approach model over the single models is promising to be implemented to improve downscaling rainfall at a single site.", "Sensitivity analysis and mapping the potential groundwater vulnerability zones in Birbhum district, India: A comparative approach between vulnerability models ": "The assessment of groundwater vulnerability is essential especially in developing areas, where agriculture is the main source of the population. In the present study, four different overlay and index method, namely, DRASTIC, modified DRASTIC, pesticide DRASTIC and modified pesticide DRASTIC are implemented with a view to identifying the most appropriate method that predicts the vulnerable zone to groundwater pollution. Sensitivity analysis reveals that net recharge is the most influential parameter of the vulnerability index. Cross comparison of model output shows the highest similarity of 97% is observed between drastic and modified drastic while the maximum difference in models prediction of 49% is observed between modified drastic and pesticide drastic. Reported nitrate concentrations in groundwater are considered for validation of model-generated final output map. The prediction power of the models are assessed using success and prediction rate method and it highlights DRASTIC model as the most suitable model with 89.69% and 84.54% of the area under area under the curve (AUC) for success and prediction rate respectively.", "Groundwater: Extraction versus recharge; vulnerability assessment ": "The rising demands of groundwater for agricultural, due to the non-reliability of surface water sources have placed groundwater resource under serious pressure subjecting it to depletion and quality deterioration risks. Since, The Nile Delta aquifer is one of the most important renewable groundwater reservoirs in Egypt; it stands as the second source of water after the Nile, especially in the Nile Delta region. The Nile Delta aquifer is continuously recharged by irrigation water and through seepage from surface water. Moreover the Nile Delta aquifer is vulnerable to saltwater intrusion resulting from increasing groundwater abstraction. A 3D regional model for the Nile Delta aquifer system has been constructed to be used as a water management tool for different water management scenarios. The model was used to test the sensitivity of the aquifer to different extraction and recharge rates and investigate the system response on heads and salinity of the aquifer. The results confirmed that sensitivity of the aquifer to the tested parameters differs from one place to another.", "Effect of motor vibration problem on the power quality of water pumping stations ": "In this paper the effect of motor vibration problems on the dynamic performance and electrical power quality of water pumping stations is studied. A pump unit was tested for a full load and no load operating conditions. The dynamic results indicated that there is a problem of looseness in the motor base plate. The measurements were repeated again after achieving good support to the motor on its base plate. The results indicated that the vibration level decreased about 48% due to good support. The electrical power quality analysis showed that; the total harmonic distortion (THD) increases by about 1\u20132% due to the effect of bad motor vibration, and the 5th and 7th harmonic contents also increased by about 0.5\u20131.0%. Also the bad motor vibration caused large values of instantaneous flicker. These results indicated that the bad motor support causes many dynamics troubles and causes some power quality problems for the electrical feeder.", "Characterization of hydro chemistry and groundwater quality evaluation for drinking purpose in Adigrat area, Tigray, northern Ethiopia ": "This paper assesses the chemistry of groundwater and evaluate its quality for drinking purpose using water quality index (WQI) approach and comparing to WHO and Ethiopia water quality standards in Adigrat area in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Chemical composition of the groundwater in the area varies widely depending on the human activities. A total of 22 depth integrated groundwater samples were collected from 13 boreholes, 4 shallow, 4 hand-dug wells in addition to 1 reservoir, using purposive sampling technique. These samples were analyzed for physico-chemical parameters which include cations (Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, Manganese, Chromium, copper and Ammonia), anions (Fluoride, Chlorine, Nitrate, Nitrite, Bicarbonate, Sulphate and Phosphate) and other parameters (total hardness, hardness as calcium carbonate, Alkalinity pH, electrical conductivity, Total Dissolved solids) as well as physical parameters (turbidity, true color, odor and taste), were assessed to evaluate the groundwater quality for drinking.\n                  The groundwater is suitable for drinking purpose with respect to pH, EC, TDS and CaCO3 hardness as well as physical parameters (turbidity, true color, odor and taste).

Out of 212 bacterial isolates, 39.2% and 60.8% were recovered from drains and Rosetta branch, respectively. Susceptibility of bacteria to different antibiotics showed multiple antibiotics resistances (MAR) for the majority of isolates. Meanwhile, sensitivity was mostly directed to ofloxacin and norfloxacin antibiotics. Calculated MAR index values (>0.25) classified area of study as potentially health risk environment. Testing virulence ability of bacteria from drains showed positive results (65%). Contrastively, virulent strains in Rosetta branch were mostly lacking in this study. Concluding remarks justify the strong correlation (r=+0.82) between MAR and virulence of bacteria in polluted aquatic ecosystems, and highlight the potential of drains as reactors for their amplification and dissemination. The study suggests regular monitoring for antibiotics resistance in native bacteria of River Nile, prohibition of unregulated use of antibiotics, and proper management for wastes disposal.", "Water poverty in upper Bagmati River Basin in Nepal ": "Water Poverty Index (WPI) is a simple and transparent tool to measure water stress at the household and village levels so that local an'd national water agencies can manage problem of access to water, quality and variability; water uses and capacity for water management considering environmental aspects.

It is transforming how we assemble our prototypes and, in the future, manufacture our products. There have been a number of materials that can be utilized for this technology, however, high performance polymer nanocomposites are a very important class of material that is just recently being used in additive manufacturing. High performance polymer is a group of polymer materials that are known to retain its desirable mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties when subjected to harsh environment such as high temperature, high pressure, and corrosive chemicals. When mixed with nanofillers such as carbon nanotube, nanoclay, and graphene, these polymers can have improved mechanical properties and sometimes acquire properties that were not present initially like thermal and electrical conductivity.

The various types of polyurethane waste products, consisting of either old recycled parts or production waste, are generally reduced to a more usable form, such as flakes, powder or pellets, depending on the particular type of polyurethane that is being recycled. The various recycling technologies for material and chemical recycling of PU materials have greatly contributed to improve the overall image regarding the recyclability of polyurethanes in recent years, by far the most important being regrinding and glycolysis. These technologies open an emerging, effective and economic route for recycling polyurethane rigid foams and composite. Polyurethane foam in automotive seating has been successfully recycled using regrind technology. Glycolysis of polyurethanes can be economically acceptable, but still requires more development in order to tolerate more contamination in the post-consumer material. Current technologies can recover the inherent energy value of polyurethanes and reduce fossil fuel consumption. Energy recovery is considered the only suitable disposal method for recovered material for which no markets exist or can be created. Increasing waste-to-energy and other thermal processing activities involving gasification, pyrolysis and two-stage combustion has contributed for the disposal of significant amounts of scrap PU without many difficulties. It is concluded that many of the plastic feedstock recycling processes appear to be technically feasible and robust enough to warrant further development in the future.", "A review on lignin-based polymeric, micro- and nano-structured materials ": "Next to cellulose, lignin is the second most abundant biopolymer, and the main source of aromatic structures on earth. It is a phenolic macromolecule, with a complex structure which considerably varies depending on the plant species and the isolation process. Lignin has long been obtained as a by-product of cellulose in the paper pulp production, but had rather low added-value applications. Changes in the paper market have however stimulated the need to focus on other applications for lignins. In addition, the emergence of biorefinery projects to develop biofuels, bio-based materials and chemicals from carbohydrate polymers should also generate large amounts of lignin with the potential for value addition.\n                  These developments have brought about renewed interest in the last decade for lignin and its potential use in polymer materials. This review covers both the topics of the direct use of lignin in polymer applications, and of the chemical modifications of lignin, in a polymer chemistry perspective. The future trend toward micro- and nanostructured lignin-based materials is then addressed.", "Decontamination of caesium and strontium from stainless steel surfaces using hydrogels ": "Current methods for the decontamination of radioactively contaminated surfaces in nuclear facilities typically rely on the use of liquid agents to remove radionuclides. This generates large volumes of highly hazardous liquid waste which must then be treated in costly processes which often require purpose built plant. For the first time we report a nitric acid loaded polymer hydrogel based approach which gives a high decontamination factor for the removal of 137Cs and 90Sr on 304\u202fL grade stainless steel surfaces. The generation of minimal liquid waste and no lateral spread or increased penetration of radionuclides helps mitigate many of the intrinsic hazards of liquid based decontamination methods. Once dried these gels are able to retain the contaminants for treatment as solid waste resulting in a concentrated, less mobile waste form presenting significantly reduced hazards and treatment constraints.", "Design and development of self-healing coating based on thiol\u2013epoxy reactions ": "Cracks caused by the effects of mechanical or chemicals forces on coatings may cause their performance to deteriorate and may shorten their lifetime. The microcapsules used for self-healing coatings provide automatic recovery and extend the life of the coatings. In this study, polyurea-formaldehyde epoxy resin (PUF-epoxy) microcapsules were synthesized by in-situ polymerization; because, they allow the size control of the microcapsules, the thickness of the shell can be controlled, its production is easy, it is cheap and combinable with industry. Synthesized microcapsules were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), optical microscope, UV spectrum, zeta analyzer and contact angle measurements. As a result of the thermal analysis, the core (epoxy) content of the microcapsules was 57% by weight and 60% by the extraction method based on the principle of selective dissolution, and these two values were compatible with each other. The average microcapsule diameter was found as 185\u202fnm. For the first time in the literature, an epoxy-containing microcapsule was added to the thiol-containing coating material and a self-healing coating was prepared. The epoxy-containing microcapsules were artificially cracked and the epoxy resin released from it reacted with the thiol received in the coating. For this reason, it was observed that the artificial scratches formed on the coatings showed good self-healing properties.", "Investigation of swelling/degradation behaviour of alginate beads crosslinked with Ca2+ and Ba2+ ions ": "Spherical beads have been prepared by ionotropic gelation of sodium alginate in the presence of CaCl2 and BaCl2 solutions and their swelling behavior has been studied. The barium ion-crosslinked beads exhibit almost minimum swelling of 40\u00b13% in PBS at pH 7.4 but possess greater stability while calcium alginate beads exhibit nearly 160% of water uptake and subsequently dissolve. The beads appear to swell through ion-exchange process which was confirmed by monitoring the Ca2+ release from the calcium alginate beads. The release was found to be diffusion controlled. On treatment with 0.1 M HCl, the calcium alginate beads demonstrated a decrease in water uptake in PBS at pH 7.4 with faster degradation while for acid treated barium alginate beads, the water uptake was found to increase on treatment with HCl. When the two beads samples were put in media of continuous varying pH (to mimic the passage of beads from mouth to colon), barium alginate beads possessed greater stability, thus showing potential to be used for colon-targeted oral delivery.", "Cross-linking of cellulose and poly(ethylene glycol) with citric acid ": "A novel approach to modifying native cellulosic fibres with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) impregnation and simultaneous cross-linking by citric acid (CA) was investigated. To understand the contributions of different components in the system, control references with just CA and cellulosic fibres (filter paper) were studied. The effect of sodium hypophosphite as a catalyst was also assessed. The results revealed that ester bonds are indeed formed in the cellulose\u2013PEG\u2013CA reaction system, as indicated by weight percentage gain (WPG) and FTIR analysis. The best results were achieved by using 5% CA and 10% PEG (calculated as weight-% from cellulose). In the reaction, the environmentally friendly CA prevents PEG from being leached out of cellulose during washing, resulting in promising future applications in dimensionally stabilized products based on cellulosic fibres.", "A review of the latest development of polyimide based membranes for CO2 separations ": "Membrane technology is a very emerging industrial process offering significant advantages in terms of low energy requirements, capital investments, easy to operate and compact equipment, in comparison with the traditional processes. This is due to the selective barrier, through the thin layer structure, which is called membrane, in which the separation occurs with relative lower energy demands. To this end, many types of materials, commercially available or synthesized in the laboratory, have been tested as candidate materials in various membrane applications. Properties such as, plasticization, solubility in inorganic or organic solvents, high thermal properties, flexibility, mechanical strength are required for the selection of the optimum material for every industrial application. In any case, the major factors that define the selection of a material as well as the efficiency of a certain filtration process are the high permeation and separation coefficients. The separation mechanism in a polymeric membrane mainly depends on material's nature combined with its formation process. Due to extreme differences between the polymer candidates many studies have been reported in the literature regarding the optimum materials for the different membrane types. Polyimides are a very attractive class of polymers that can be used on membrane technology, exhibiting high selectivities combined with high permeances for a large variety of applications including gas and liquid separations. In this article the principle theory of the mass transfer phenomena through polymers and a brief outline of polyimides based gas separation membranes are presented and discussed. In specific, selected works of the preparation routine and the gas permeation/selectivity properties of polyimide based membranes are presented and discussed by giving emphasis on the carbon dioxide permeation and separation properties.", "Preparation and application of starch nanoparticles for nanocomposites: A review ": "The increasing scientific and industrial interest for starch nanoparticles (SNP) has led to the development of numerous methods for preparing sub-micron starch fillers for nanocomposites applications. Starch nanocrystals (SNC), which constitute the focus of this review, are one type of SNP with crystalline property and platelet like morphology. SNC can be extracted from various starch botanical sources, allowing to obtain a large range of amylose content, shape, viscosity in suspension, surface reactivity and thermal resistance. To date, the most common method for extracting SNC remains the mild acid hydrolysis of the amorphous parts of native granular starch. So far, alternative methods render much lower yield. Since first publications on SNC, the principal aim is to use them as reinforcement in polymer matrices. Thanks to the reactive nature of starch, SNC surface can be modified by grafting or cross-linking which renders them more readily dispersible in the polymer matrix. The present review focus on the reinforcing effect and mechanisms of SNC, as well as on their impact of barrier properties of polymers.", "Chitosan-modifications and applications: Opportunities galore ": "Of late, the most bountiful natural biopolymer chitin and chitosan have become cynosure of all party because of an unusual combination of biological activities plus mechanical and physical properties. However applications of chitin are limited due to its inherent insoluble and intractable nature. Chitosan, alkaline hydrolytic derivative of chitin has better solubility profile, less crystallinity and is amenable to chemical modifications due to presence of functional groups as hydroxyl, acetamido, and amine. The chemical modification of chitosan is of interest because the modification would not change the fundamental skeleton of chitosan, would keep the original physicochemical and biochemical properties and finally would bring new or improved properties. In view of rapidly growing interest in chitosan its chemical aspects and chemical modification studies is reviewed. The several chemical modifications such as oligomerization, alkylation, acylation, quternization, hydroxyalkylation, carboxyalkylation, thiolation, sulfation, phosphorylation, enzymatic modifications and graft copolymerization along with many assorted modifications have been carried out. The chemical modification affords a wide range of derivatives with modified properties for specific end use applications in diversified areas mainly of pharmaceutical, biomedical and biotechnological fields. Assorted modifications including chitosan hybrids with sugars, cyclodextrin, dendrimers, and crown ethers have also emerged as interesting multifunctional macromolecules. The versatility in possible modifications and applications of chitosan derivatives presents a great challenge to scientific community and to industry. The successful acceptance of this challenge will change the role of chitosan from being a molecule in waiting to a lead player.", "Preparation of poly(thiourethane) thermosets by controlled thiol-isocyanate click reaction using a latent organocatalyst ": "s\n               \n                  Different poly(thiourethane) thermosets were prepared by means of a thiol-isocyanate click reaction starting from three diisocyanates with different structure (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI, 4,4\u2032-methylene bis(cyclohexy isocyanate), HMDI and hexamethylene diisocyanate, HDI, and a tetrathiol, pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate), PETMP. The curing process has been catalyzed by basic and acid catalysts. The use of a thermally activated base generator (1-methylimidazolium tetraphenylborate, BG1MI), which is an organocatalyst, allowed a better control on the curing initiation than those traditionally used dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) or tertiary amines. The curing evolution was investigated by DSC and FTIR spectroscopy.\n                  The materials obtained were characterized by thermomechanical and mechanical tests. Homogeneous materials were obtained in all cases. The chemical structure of the network was correlated with the thermal and mechanical data determined. Tg values in the range of 75 to 150\u202f\u00b0C were obtained. The thermal degradation of these materials has also been investigated and a complex degradation mechanism, with three different steps was observed in all cases. These materials showed a higher thermal stability than their oxygen counterparts did.\n                  The thermosets obtained using the latent organocatalyst have similar characteristics to the ones obtained by using the common DBTDL.", "Effect of backbone structure on the thermoelectric performance of indacenodithiophene-based conjugated polymers ": "Two indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based conjugated polymers, PIDT-EDOT and PIDTT-EDOT, were designed and synthesized as organic thermoelectric materials. Compared to PIDT-EDOT, the IDT unit of PIDTT-EDOT was extended by incorporating two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units into the polymer main chain. The polymer PIDTT-EDOT showed better thermal stability and more planar conjugated structure than PIDT-EDOT. Meanwhile, different thermoelectric properties were observed when the two polymer films were doped with FeCl3. PIDTT-EDOT showed better thermoelectric properties than PIDT-EDOT, and the highest power factor observed for PIDTT-EDOT was 0.867\u202f\u03bcW\u202fm\u22121\u202fK\u22122 at 453\u202fK, which is approximately 25 times higher than that of PIDT-EDOT. These results indicate that a slight change in the polymer main chain will have a great impact on the thermoelectric properties of IDT-based conjugated polymers. The data presented herein can be used as a reference for the design of new high-performance thermoelectric materials.", "Dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose cross-linked chitosan for the recovery of palladium and platinum from aqueous solution ": "Platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) have widespread applications, such as in catalysts, jewelry, fuel cells, and electronics because of their favorable physical and chemical properties. Recovery of Pt and Pd from secondary sources is of great concern due to the increased market demand and limitation of the natural reserves of these precious metals. The aim of this research is to achieve recovery of Pt and Pd ions from dilute aqueous solution using dialdehyde of carboxymethyl cellulose (DCMC) crosslinked chitosan (Ch-DCMC). The DCMC was prepared by periodate oxidation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Both the DCMC and Ch-DCMC were characterized before and after Pt or Pd adsorption using Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of cross-linking ratios of chitosan and DCMC (1:1, 1:0.8, 1:0.5, 1:0.25 and 1:0.1) on the Pt and Pd recovery was studied. The optimal cross-linking ratio was found to be 1:0.25 (chitosan: DCMC) with maximum adsorption capacity of 80.8\u202fmg/g Pt and 89.4\u202fmg/g Pd. High selectivity for Pt and Pd compared to base metals and common anions was achieved.", "Porous structure of hypercrosslinked polystyrene: State-of-the-art mini-review ": "The paper evaluates accumulated information about the apparent inner surface area (S\n                     app), pore volume (W\n                     o), pore size (diameter, D), and pore size distribution (PSD) of the single-phase hypercrosslinked polystyrene networks prepared by an intensive post-crosslinking of either dissolved linear polystyrene or swollen gel-type styrene\u2013divinylbenzene copolymers. Critical analysis of data obtained by conventional physical methods used for the characterization of porous solids (low temperature adsorption of nitrogen or argon, mercury intrusion porosimetry, inversed size exclusion chromatography, electronic microscopy, positronium annihilation) reveals the most trustworthy porosity parameters of the above hypercrosslinked polystyrene resins as S\n                     app\n                     \u2a7e1000m2/g, W\n                     o in the range of 0.3\u20130.5cm3/g, D in dry networks from 4\u20135 to 30\u00c5 and only slightly increasing in swollen samples. The hypercrosslinked networks thus present first basically microporous polymeric material that exhibits narrow PSD resulting from a statistically uniform distribution of crosslinks.", "Low cost fabrication of polypropylene fiber composite membrane with excellent mechanical, superhydrophilic, antifouling and antibacterical properties for effective oil-in-water emulsion separation ": "In this work, a low cost and flexible composite membrane containing the meltblown and spunbond polypropylene (PP) microfibers was designed and fabricated by means of the hot pressing followed by dip-coating of chitosan solution. We systematically studied the morphological structure, wettability, mechanical property, anti-oil fouling and anti-bacterial performance. The chitosan-modified PP (CS-PP) composite membrane exhibited the superhydrophilicity, underwater superoleophobicity and ultralow oil-adhesion property. Meanwhile, it was found that, solely under the driving of gravity, the water permeation flux of the CS-PP composite membrane was 325, 315, 276 and 265\u202fL\u00b7m\u00b7\u22122\u00b7h\u22121 for the toluene-in-water, n-hexane-in-water, diesel-in-water and vegetable oil-in-water emulsions, respectively, and the separation efficiency was up to 99%. The antibacterial activity could be observed for the CS-PP composite membrane by the inhibition zone testing. In addition, the combination of meltblown and spunbond PP microfiber endowed the composite membrane with excellent tensile strength (up to 6.78\u202fMPa). All these results suggest the CS-PP composite membrane as a promising potential and energy-efficient separation membrane for the treatment of surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsion.", "Crosslinked chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol)-based polyelectrolytes for proton exchange membranes ": "The preparation of polyelectrolytes based on crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and chitosan (CS) was considered as a feasible alternative to develop highly functionalised, cost-effective and eco-friendly membranes for proton exchange fuel cell technologies. CS/PVA-based membranes were combined with sulfosuccinic acid (SSA) as crosslinking and sulfonating agent, and glycerol (GL) to promote flexibility and favour their manageability. The chemical structure, the thermo-oxidative behaviour, the ethanol uptake, the electric, the proton conductivity, and the performance in direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) were assessed. In general, all the CS/PVA-based polyelectrolytes showed a synergetic increase of thermo-oxidative stability, appropriate absorption and diffusion of ethanol and good proton conductivity, suitable for the typical service conditions of fuel cells. The GL in the membranes reacted with SSA, reduced the ethanol absorption, the diffusion coefficient and the proton conductivity, but acted as a plasticiser that increased the ductile manageability of the polyelectrolytes to be mounted on the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA). Higher presence of CS and higher proportion of GL in the polyelectrolyte, improved the material performance in the DEFC. In particular, the crosslinked polyelectrolyte 40CS/PVA/SSA/20GLwith a 40%wt. of CS referred to PVA, and a 20%wt. of GL referred to CS, showed a suitable behaviour in the DEFC test, with a maximum value of power density of 746\u202fmW\u00b7cm\u22122.", "Synthesis and characterization of a novel inulin hydrogel crosslinked with pyromellitic dianhydride ": "Smart hydrogels with pH and enzyme triggered release suitable for colon specific drug delivery were prepared by crosslinking inulin with pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) in a simple one pot synthesis. Back titration, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV) demonstrated that the hydrogel crosslinking reaction resulted in ester linkages and carboxylic acid groups and that the amount of the crosslinker in the hydrogel increased with increasing PMDA concentration in the crosslinking reaction. Thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the chemical change by illustrating the hydrogels changed thermal properties and appearance compared to inulin. This hydrogel showed excellent swelling in water and the degree of swelling was inversely proportional to the cross-linking density, as determined using Flory-Rehner theory. Due to the presence of the carboxylic acid groups in the structure, the swelling was pH dependent, with significantly reduced swelling as acidity decreased from pH\u202f7.4 to pH\u202f1.2.", "Using grafted poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) for the compatibilization of thermoplastic starch-polylactic acid blends ": "Thermoplastic starch (S) and polylactic acid (PLA) blend films were obtained by melt blending and compression moulding using grafted polycaprolactone with maleic anhydride and/or glycidyl methacrylate (PCLMG or PCLG) as compatibilizers. The effect of both the PLA ratio in the blend (20 and 40% with respect to starch) and the amount of both compatibilizers (2.5 and 5%) on the film properties was analysed. Compatibilized blends presented a better dispersion of the PLA in the continuous starch phase, but the use of PCLG provoked a phase inversion in the matrix when 40% of the starch was substituted by PLA. The compatibilized blend films exhibited higher values of elastic modulus than pure starch films, but were less extensible. The use of compatibilizers did not affect the film's water vapour permeability, which was reduced by up to 33 or 50% for 20 and 40% PLA, respectively, although inverted films with 40% PLA and 5% PCLG, exhibited marked reduction (67%). Compatibilizers decreased the oxygen permeability of the films by about 50%, regardless of the ratio of PLA and the kind and amount of compatibilizer. Therefore, substituting 20% of the starch by PLA and incorporating 5% of PCLG would be a good strategy to obtain films useful for food packaging.", "Mucoadhesion: A promising approach in drug delivery system ": "Mucoadhesion, the state in which two materials, amongst which one is biological in nature, adhere to each other for extended periods of time with the help of interfacial forces, provides an attractive strategy to overcome the hurdles of conventional drug delivery systems including first pass metabolism, and localized delivery of biomolecules including proteins, peptides and oligonucleotides. Mucoadhesion provides great opportunities for the delivery of a variety of compounds via different routes of administration viz. ocular, nasal, vaginal and buccal. In addition mucoadhesion also makes it possible to obtain prolonged, local or systemic drug action. In this review we discussed about potential applications of mucoadhesion and mucoadhesive polymers in drug delivery along with the mechanism of mucoadhesion and the methods for evaluation of mucoadhesive drug delivery systems.", "Preparation and evaluation of an eco-friendly, reactive, and phytic acid-based flame retardant for wool ": "Bio-derived phytic acid exhibits great potential to improve the flame retardancy of textile materials, but it has poor washing durability. In order to address this problem, an efficient, reactive, and phosphorus-containing flame retardant (FR) HPPHBTCA was synthesized using phytic acid, pentaerythritol and 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid, and the chemical structure of HPPHBTCA was characterized. HPPHBTCA was applied to develop FR functional wool fabric, and its FR efficiency and washing durability were evaluated. The wool fabric treated with 0.14\u202fmol/L HPPHBTCA had self-extinguishing performance even after 20 washing cycles during the vertical burning test, presenting good FR ability and resistance to washing. The catalytic char-forming effect of HPPHBTCA contributed to the enhanced FR and smoke suppression properties of wool fabric, and the ester bonds formed between HPPHBTCA and wool fiber resulted in the good washing durability. The HPPHBTCA treatment had a negligible effect on the whiteness, tensile strength and handle of wool fabric. This study offers a novel route to prepare the eco-friendly and durable FR agent using natural and phosphorus-containing compound.", "Recent developments in sensing devices based on polymeric systems ": "This review is focused on the analysis of recent developments in the application of polymers in the detection and quantification of target species. The work begins with a description of the polymers that are employed as sensory materials, covering molecularly imprinted polymers or MIPs, hybrid polymers, acrylic polymers, conductive polymers, polymers with chiral motifs and also the use of polymeric arrays. After the description of the sensory polymers, the different target species which can be detected using sensory polymeric devices, including metallic cations and anionic species, gases, explosives, radionuclides and bacteria or the recent biomedical and biological applications is described. Finally, the sensory devices fabricated using smart polymers, including, for example, sensory devices based on Quartz Crystal Microbalances or the use of micro and nanoporous materials as substrates for sensory polymeric coatings is listed and reviewed. The work also details the different detection mechanisms based on the type of response of the sensory polymers, such as electrical, piezoelectric or fluorescence. In brief, the review details a review of the research work published in the last 10 years in this quickly evolving field, with special emphasis in the biomedical and biological applications, which have emerged recently raising great attention. To conclude, some perspectives and future challenges that must be overcome by this research field in the next years is exposed.", "Statistical physics of ring polymers based on topological volume concept ": "Physical properties of ring polymers are subjected to topological constraint, understanding of which has been a significant challenge as a fundamental problem in polymer science. Here we overview a recent attempt to describe behavior of non-concatenated rings in their dense solution based on the notion of topological volume. Discussion includes the size scaling and dynamics of rings, and the phase behavior of blends containing ring polymers. We also discuss the bond correlation function of a ring in two-dimension, for which the non-crossing topological constraint plays a central role.", "Blends of tri-block copolymers and addition curing resins: Influence of block copolymer-resin compatibility on toughness and matrix properties on toughenability ": "In any sort of rubber toughening of thermosets, there are two principal influences on toughness: Morphology of the elastomer particulate phase and toughenability of the matrix resin. These two factors are difficult to separate experimentally. A new approach is presented which is based on large numbers of data. By analysing property-property-relationships an attempt is made to identify generalizable rules. A tri-block copolymer (PCL-PDMSi-PCL) is analysed in detail: By varying the molecular weights of the compatible and incompatible blocks in two different epoxy resins the influence of morphology on toughness is studied. Linear (Tg and rubbery plateau modulus) and non-linear (yield stress and post-yield behaviour) matrix properties are examined for a larger number of resin/curing agent combinations toughened with three different toughening agents in order to elucidate which matrix property controls toughenability. The same resin/curing agent array was used to study the influence of matrix polarity on morphology and properties for one PCL-PDMSi-PCL tri-block-copolymer.", "Perstorp's new plasticizer promises to enhance the performance and environmental profile of flexible PVC ": "Swedish speciality chemicals producer Perstorp is launching Pevalen Pro, a renewable non-phthalate plasticizer. The new polyol ester product will initially contain up to 40% of renewable content but with the long-term potential of becoming 100% renewable, the company reports. Using the new plasticizer will therefore improve the environmental footprint of flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Perstorp says.", "Sanitized invests in customer-specific development of antimicrobial masterbatches ": "Swiss antimicrobials producer Sanitized AG has added a specially developed twin-screw extruder to the capabilities available at its TecCenter in Burgdorf [ADPO, May 2016, p. 7]. The company says that this investment allows even faster development of new masterbatch combinations and the manufacture of test amounts of polymers with individual antimicrobial additives. In particular, it facilitates the targeted, customer-specific development of antimicrobial masterbatch qualities in nearly any type of polymer, it claims.", "Results decline for Orion Engineered Carbons in challenging first quarter ": "Global carbon black supplier Orion Engineered Carbons reported net income of US$19.0 million on sales revenue of $384.7 million for the first quarter of 2019. A year earlier, the company posted net income of $26.8 million and revenue of $406.7 million. Orion attributes the declines largely to \u2018suboptimal market conditions\u2019.", "Assessing, quantifying and valuing the ecosystem services of coastal lagoons ": "The natural conservation of coastal lagoons is important not only for their ecological importance, but also because of the valuable ecosystem services they provide for human welfare and wellbeing. Coastal lagoons are shallow semi-enclosed systems that support important habitats such as wetlands, mangroves, salt-marshes and seagrass meadows, as well as a rich biodiversity. Coastal lagoons are also complex social-ecological systems with ecosystem services that provide livelihoods, wellbeing and welfare to humans. This study assessed, quantified and valued the ecosystem services of 32 coastal lagoons. The main findings of the study are: (i) the definitions of ecosystem services are still not generally accepted; (ii) the quantification of ecosystem services is made in many different ways, using different units; (iii) the evaluation in monetary terms of some ecosystem service is problematic, often relying on non-monetary evaluation methods; (iv) when ecosystem services are valued in monetary terms, this may represent very different human benefits; and, (v) different aspects of climate change, including increasing temperature, sea-level rise and changes in rainfall patterns threaten the valuable ecosystem services of coastal lagoons.", "Intrinsic values in nature: Objective good or simply half of an unhelpful dichotomy? ": "Two generations of conservationists and philosophers have built a strong case for intrinsic values in nature; they are the basis of the normative postulates of conservation biology. I argue that the recognition of intrinsic natural value is a fundamental and non-negotiable aspect of an eco-evolutionary worldview. Recently, relational values, \u201cpreferences, principles, and virtues associated with relationships\u201d, have been proposed as a third category of values in nature, which may help to resolve the debate between instrumental and intrinsic valuation. By depicting intrinsic values as part of an unhelpful dichotomy between anthropocentric and ecocentric values, the current assessment of relational values fails to adequately account for the modern philosophical view of intrinsic natural value. The recognition of intrinsic natural value is not merely an academic exercise, but rather a vital aspect of conservation of the biosphere; recognition of value entails the obligation to do what is right, i.e., protect the good. Any attempt to reframe the discussion about values and environmental protection through more formal recognition of relational values will need to more clearly address how relational and intrinsic values coexist and how they can jointly form the basis for nature conservation.", "Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 in the like-minded megadiverse countries ": "The group of like-minded megadiverse countries (LMMCs), which harbours a wealth of biological and cultural diversity, adopted a Carta in 2016 to accelerate progress towards achieving Aichi Biodiversity Target 11. This paper presents the progress made over the last two years and an analysis of the LMMCs\u2019 national priority actions; approved Global Environment Facility, GEF-5 and GEF-6 protected area-related biodiversity projects; and relevant targets, goals, and actions from National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). Through their recent actions, these countries have contributed to progress in Target 11, especially with respect to marine protected area expansion, where they contributed one-sixth of the area added in national waters over the past two years. Results indicate that if implemented as planned, actions proposed by the LMMCs will increase terrestrial and marine protected area coverage by 1,106,148\u202fkm2 and 192,214\u202fkm2 respectively. Of these commitments, 227,230\u202fkm2 in terrestrial and 144,475\u202fkm2 in marine protected areas have the highest chance of being implemented. In total, 741 commitments were identified from the above sources, with implications on the qualitative elements of Target 11 (coverage of areas important for biodiversity, areas important for ecosystem services, ecological representation, connectivity, effective management, equitable management, and integration into the wider landscapes and seascapes). Of these 741 commitments, 25% showed a strong likelihood of being implemented. The country-level analysis of all commitments indicates that equitable management and integration will show the most progress, measured against identified gaps, if commitments are implemented as proposed. This progress on the qualitative elements of Target 11 in the LMMCs will also provide benefits and co-benefits for other Aichi Targets and for the requirements of other multi-lateral environmental agreements, as well as at the global level.", "Assessing the conservation potential of fish and corals in aquariums globally ": "Aquatic ecosystems are indispensable for life on earth and yet despite their essential function and service roles, marine and freshwater biomes are facing unprecedented threats from both traditional and emerging anthropogenic stressors. The resultant species and ecosystem-level threat severity requires an urgent response from the conservation community. With their care facilities, veterinary and conservation breeding expertise, reintroduction and restoration, and public communication reach, stand-alone aquariums and zoos holding aquatic taxa have great collective potential to help address the current biodiversity crisis, which is now greater in freshwater than land habitats. However, uncertainty regarding the number of species kept in such facilities hinders assessment of their conservation value. Here we analyzed, standardized and shared data of zoological institution members of Species360, for fish and Anthozoa species (i.e. Actinopterygii, Elasmobranchii, Holocephali, Myxini, Sarcopterygii and Anthozoa). To assess the conservation potential of populations held in these institutions, we cross-referenced the Species360 records with the following conservation schemes: the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES), the IUCN Red List of Threatened species, climate change vulnerability, Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) and The Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE). We found that aquariums hold four of the six fish species listed by the IUCN Red List as \u2018Extinct in the Wild\u2019, 31% of Anthozoa species listed by Foden et al. (2013) as vulnerable to climate change, 19 out of the 111 Anthozoa EDGE species, and none of the species prioritized by the AZE. However, it is very likely that significant additional species of high conservation value are held in aquariums that do not manage their records in standardized, sharable platforms such as Species360. Our study highlights both the great value of aquarium and zoo collections for addressing the aquatic biodiversity crisis, as well as the importance that they maintain comprehensive, standardised, globally-shared taxonomic data.", "Debunking the myth that a legal trade will solve the rhino horn crisis: A system dynamics model for market demand ": "There is considerable debate in the literature over whether or not to legalise the trade in rhino horns. Here a system dynamics model is developed that considers five components: rhino abundance, rhino demand, a price model, an income model and a supply model. The study indicates the importance of shifting from a conventional (sectoral) conservation model to a more non-conventional (sustainable) approach that models the interactions between the different components. While the results under the no trade scenario are similar for both the equilibrium and disequilibrium model, under the trade scenario results were sometimes quite disparate. This study finds that sometimes second best solutions from an economic perspective may be optimal if conservation interests are to be achieved.", "Does a reduction in the price of rhino horn prevent poaching? ": "Rhino poaching around the world has increased inordinately, to the extent that concerns exist over the possible survival of the species. An open access rhino poaching model is developed for South African rhino. The model is a hybrid dynamical model, as both a system dynamics model as well as a Bayesian network model are developed. The system dynamics model is used to estimate the unknown parameter values (through optimisation) and also to determine the intervals for the parameters. These intervals are then used in the Bayesian Belief Network model to assess uncertainty. Hybrid approaches improve the ability to validate models compared with conventional modelling. The resultant model indicates that reducing the price of rhino horn would not be effective at curbing poaching, unless poacher costs are also increased. However, increasing poacher costs is not a realistic policy option since these costs are largely beyond the control of decision-makers. The insensitivity of price to poaching effort has implications for methods proposed to reduce the value of rhinos, such as introducing synthetic rhino horn and the de-horning of rhinos.", "Incorporating landscape heterogeneity into multi-objective spatial planning improves biodiversity conservation of semi-natural grasslands ": "Recent actions to mitigate biodiversity loss in agricultural environments appear insufficient despite the considerable efforts channeled via the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy. One likely reason for this failure is the limited attention paid to the regional and landscape level ecological characteristics in farmland conservation planning. We demonstrate how to obtain conservation prioritization solutions that would address simultaneously three goals, including two landscape level targets: minimizing local habitat quality loss, maximizing habitat connectivity, and incorporating landscape heterogeneity. As these goals may be contradictory, we investigate the potential trade-offs between them. We used the Zonation prioritization tool to examine how our three goals could be implemented in the agricultural landscapes of southwest Finland. We used measures of (i) biodiversity value of grasslands, (ii) connectivity between grasslands, and (iii) landscape heterogeneity which comprised of (land cover type based) compositional heterogeneity and (field margin based) configurational heterogeneity. Integration of landscape heterogeneity measures and habitat connectivity resulted in some trade-offs with local habitat quality, the most prominent observation being that landscape heterogeneity co-varied with grassland connectivity. Among the two landscape heterogeneity parameters, inclusion of compositional heterogeneity resulted in more clustered prioritization solutions than configurational heterogeneity, which had a spatially more balanced impact. Concordance among landscape scale factors implies high potential for reconstruction of a functioning network of semi-natural grasslands in areas under intensive agricultural use. Broader scale multi-objective planning approaches can thus importantly support targeting biodiversity conservation planning and mediating the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy objectives.", "Nature conservation on decommissioned military training areas \u2013 German approaches and experiences ": "Military training areas (MTAs) host high numbers of endangered habitats and species due to their large area, generally low fertilizer and biocide exposure, and a high dynamic of disturbances caused by military training activities. Since the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, thousands of former military properties have been closed due to international disarmament agreements. Based on a literature review, we present the importance of decommissioned MTAs in Germany for nature conservation, their number, area, and status, as well as the German approaches and experiences managing these sites. More than 119,000\u2009ha of former military areas of high conservation value were transferred by the Federal Government to German Federal States, the German Federal Environmental Foundation, and other nature conservation organizations as part of the so-called National Nature Heritage (NNH), and an additional 60,000\u2009ha were saved in other ways. It is a big challenge in nature conservation to establish appropriate management systems to maintain the endangered habitats and species on these sites, most of which are contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO). Several projects have been implemented in Germany to develop strategies to deal with UXO contamination. We discuss management options, from prescribed burning on UXO contaminated sites to the establishment of wilderness, in the light of the requirements of the European Union\u2019s Natura 2000 network of protected areas.", "Does traditional and advanced guarding reduce crop losses due to wildlife? A comparative analysis from Africa and Asia ": "Crop damage caused by herbivorous wildlife species on farms located within conservation landscapes, is a driver of human-wildlife conflict (HWC). Guarding of farms, whereby farmers spend the night out in the fields, in areas adjacent to protected areas is, therefore, very common in many African and Asian countries. Furthermore, guarding is often combined with other crop protection measures, but little is known about the efficacy of these measures.\n                  We examined the effect that different traditional and advanced crop protection measures (active and passive guarding strategies, barriers and combinations of measures) had on the magnitude of damaged crops. For this, we examined the cost of crop damage caused by a total of 20 wildlife species in two African and two Asian study areas, where different protection types were applied. Data was compared with the cost of crop damage on unprotected fields. We continuously used a standardised HWC assessment scheme over six years (2009\u20132014), based on site observations and measurements in addition to interviews with victims.\n                  The analysis of crop damage costs revealed substantial losses, especially from that caused by elephants (Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus) and other large herbivores, such as zebra (Equus quagga) and common eland (Taurotragus oryx). Once wildlife had entered the farms, it was found that crop protection measures by farmers were only able to reduce damage costs when applied as a communal, strategic guarding system. Surprisingly, all other traditional crop protection strategies have proven ineffective in reducing crop damage costs. Electrical fences actually increased the risk of crop damage when combined with guarding and the chasing of wildlife strategies. Therefore, we recommend reviewing the practice of traditional guarding strategies and the effectiveness of fences. Furthermore, we emphasise the need for objective evaluation of HWC mitigation strategies in the long-term.", "Setting conservation priorities for Lebanese flora\u2014Identification of important plant areas ": "Considered as a hotspot for biodiversity in the Mediterranean Basin, Lebanon is currently witnessing anarchic urbanization and unprecedented destruction of its natural habitats. Unregulated urbanization is also compounded by the surge in Lebanon\u2019s population due to the unabated influx of Syrian refugees since 2012. This work aims to define Important Plant Areas (IPAs) with exceptional botanical richness. These IPAs should constitute the priority zones for conservation, contributing to the fulfillment of national targets in the framework of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\n                  A customised methodology was developed to suit to the Lebanese geomorphological characteristics, using an approach that combined three indicators: species richness; species conservation value including endemism and rarity; and, the habitat conservation value. Out of the characterized 1250 cells of 3\u202fkm\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fkm covering Lebanon, 11 were ranked as IPAs of very high importance and 20 as IPAs of high importance. These 31 top ranked cells covered 3% of Lebanon\u2019s area. These IPAs contained diverse habitat mosaics, including forests, mountain screes, cliffs and grasslands and host a total of 2386 species amounting to 79% of the flora of Lebanon and 80% of the species endemic to Lebanon. Seven of these top ranked cells contained species strictly endemic to Lebanon. Only 26% of these IPAs were already designated as protected areas and hosted 45% of Lebanon\u2019s plant species.\n                  This map of IPAs provides important information for stakeholders, practitioners and politicians involved in conservation in Lebanon to protect endangered zones and develop rational strategies for their conservation.", "\u2018Ecosystem service opportunities\u2019: A practice-oriented framework for identifying economic instruments to enhance biodiversity and human livelihoods ": "Economic instruments that promise \u201cwin-win\u201d solutions for both biodiversity conservation and human livelihoods have become increasingly popular over recent years. There however remains a gap in terms of practical and policy-relevant guidance about appropriate approaches that take into account the local needs and the specific cultural, legal, and ecological context in which such instruments are being developed and applied. This paper presents a step-by-step framework that helps conservation and development planners and practitioners to identify economic instruments that can promote pro-conservation behaviour in a specific setting. The concept of \u2018ecosystem service opportunities\u2019 builds on, and brings together, general economic principles and an ecosystem services perspective. The framework was designed to also address a number of concerns regarding economic approaches in order to help practitioners recognise the potentials and limits of economic approaches to nature conservation. The framework is illustrated by its application within the realm of a biodiversity conservation project in Thailand.", "Identifying key factors, actors and relevant scales in landscape and conservation planning, management and decision making: Promoting effective citizen involvement ": "The paper analyses the current limitations of the constraints of decision and action processes in land-use, resource management and conservation policies and approaches, identifying their main factors, proposing alternative strategies to solve the present gaps and limitations. It identifies the need for a new paradigmatic approach based on innovative forms of involvement, commitment and individual and community rewarding systems. This approach is developed based on the characterization of the main drivers of land-use, resource management and conservation policies, namely \u03b1-perceptions (immediate and primary satisfaction) and k-perceptions (more mediate and complex consideration of satisfaction, implying long-term perceptions and collective benefits beyond the individual interests). It also analyses the effects of the introduction of new forms of income and incentives (such as trade-offs and payments for environmental services) or management approaches such as Ecological-Based Management or the use of Nature-Based Solutions. The main axioms and instruments necessary to build such a new paradigmatic approach (namely trade-offs, accountability and contractualization) are described. On this basis, it is possible to present a concept for an innovative institutional and social culture and a governance system aimed at an effective land-use, resource management and conservation policies. This governance concept is described and its sustaining individual, social and institutional drivers enunciated.", "Understanding social demand for sustainable nature conservation. The case of a protected natural space in South-Eastern Spain ": "The implementation of sustainable management plans for protected areas is one of the main challenges for public institutions. These plans involve public participation and the assessment of social benefits provided by these open spaces. This work proposes the use of choice experiments methodology for the evaluation of management alternatives for a protected area. The case study within this work is El Valle and Carrascoy Natural Park, which is included in the Natura 2000 Network. This Protected Natural Area (PNA) is located in a peri-urban area; thus, it combines high natural values and high anthropic pressure. A Choice Experiment (CE) was designed through consultation with the Park managers and technicians, and it was applied to a representative sample of the population within the Region of Murcia (South-Eastern Spain). CE allowed an estimation of the value of different management alternatives, classified according to the three main sustainability areas: social; economic; and, environmental. The results show population's demand for environmental management alternatives, such as protection of flora and fauna and promotion of ecotourism, as well as a rejection of quarrying in the PNA. The economic values estimated allow the proposal of a distribution of the annual budget of the PNA according to the social demand.", "Willingness to pay for mitigating human-elephant conflict by residents of Nepal ": "Human-elephant Conflict (HEC) is a significant problem in Nepal, with approximately two-thirds of households being impacted by elephants (Elephas maximus), particularly during the winter. In addition to elephant casualties, more than 10% of the households surveyed have had human casualties (injury or death) during the past 5 years. This study evaluates the economic viability of elephant conservation in Nepal within the context of current and proposed HEC mitigation scenarios. Face-to-face interviews were carried out using a structured questionnaire to elicit the residents\u2019 willingness to pay (WTP) for elephant conservation and HEC mitigation programs using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Residents\u2019 WTP was found to be positively related to income and education, and negatively related to damage-related programs. Local stakeholders were willing to pay about 42% more to programs that were economically transparent and improved upon existing management. Residents\u2019 WTP were also greater if they have had previous HEC-related injuries or deaths.", "The use of ecological integrity indicators within the natural capital index framework: The ecological and economic value of the remnant natural capital of M\u00e9xico ": "In this paper, the ecological integrity hierarchy framework (EIHF) and the natural capital index framework (NCI) are integrated as decision-making tools for evaluating the natural capital of Mexico. Two hierarchy-levels of ecological integrity indicators are used to estimate the quality and quantity of the natural capital, the amount of ecological degradation and ecological sustainability. After human transformation, the extent still considered as \u201cnatural\u201d in the country is \u223c67%; while the amount of human transformed areas is \u223c33%, which gives a total estimate of NCI\u2009=\u20090.334; i.e., only \u223c33.4% of the national capital remains available, while \u223c33% is ecologically degraded. Furthermore, the critical natural capital; i.e., the legacy for future generations that remains in the country is only \u223c12%. The total estimated value of the current natural capital in Mexico is \u223c$457.1 billion/yr, which is \u223c435 times greater than the national GDP ($1.051 billion in 2010). The cost of maintaining the degradation of the natural capital is \u223c$144.6 billion/yr (\u223c138 times greater than national GDP in 2010). The potential value of the natural capital after restoration would be \u223c$602 billion/yr. Valuing the natural capital can be helpful for strategic environmental evaluations and useful for spatial decision support systems that evaluate natural capital as a decision-making tool.", "Seventy-year chronology of Salinas in southern France: Coastal surfaces managed for salt production and conservation issues for abandoned sites ": "After World War II, twenty-nine coastal Salinas (122\u2009km2), located in the vicinity of coastal lagoons and in deltas, were exploited along the Mediterranean coastlines in South France. Today, only five of these are still actively producing salt, currently representing 175\u2009km2. Concomitant with the abandonment of many of the smaller Salinas, the larger Salinas in the Rh\u00f4ne delta (Camargue) strongly increased their surfaces at the expense of natural ecosystems, of which a part has also been abandoned after 2009. This paper documents these changes in landscape use by chronological GIS mapping and describes the fate of the 91\u2009km2 of abandoned Salina surfaces. The majority of this area (88\u2009km2) is included in the Natura 2000 network, among which most (74\u2009km2) has been acquired by the French coastal protection agency (Conservatoire du Littoral) to be designated as Protected Areas. Only a very minor part (<1%) has been lost for industry and harbour development. Managing abandoned Salinas as Protected Areas is a challenge, because of the different landscape, biodiversity conservation, natural and cultural heritages issues at stake. In two cases, abandoned Salinas have been brought back again into exploitation by private initiative thus allowing for the protection of original hypersaline biodiversity. In other cases, the shaping of the landscape by natural processes has been privileged. This has facilitated the spontaneous recreation of temporal Mediterranean wetlands with unique aquatic vegetation, and offered opportunities for managed coastal re-alignment and the restoration of hydrobiological exchanges between land and sea. In other areas, former salt ponds continue to be filled artificially by pumping favouring opportunities for waterfowl. This has often been combined with the creation of artificial islets to provide nesting ground for bird colonies protected from terrestrial predators.", "Concern about climate change, biodiversity loss, habitat degradation and landscape change: Embedded in different packages of environmental concern? ": "Climate change and biodiversity loss are often seen as the two most serious environmental threats facing humanity. It also seems to be a common notion that concerns about these issues are embedded in the same package of environmental concern among the public. In this article, we probe the relationship between dimensions of concern about environmental challenges. In a general population survey in Norway, respondents were asked how concerned they were about several environmental issues. Factor analysis revealed that concern about climate change and concern about major causes of biodiversity loss, such as habitat destruction, loaded on different factors. When respondents ranked the three issues they were most concerned about, there was minimal overlap between climate change and biodiversity loss. It appears that relatively distinct profiles exist, based on different interpretations of current environmental challenges. The profiles are differently related to background factors such as social class, education and gender. These relationships are not strong, but the association between confidence in various institutional actors and the concern profiles is quite distinct, and different for the two. Further research is needed to properly elucidate drivers behind the different orientations.", "Mapping recreational visits and values of European National Parks by combining statistical modelling and unit value transfer ": "Recreation is a major ecosystem service and an important co-benefit of nature conservation. The recreational value of National Parks (NPs) can be a strong argument in favour of allocating resources for preserving and creating NPs worldwide. Managing NPs to optimize recreational services can therefore indirectly contribute to nature conservation and biodiversity protection. Understanding the drivers of recreational use of national parks is crucial.\n                  In this study we use a combination of primary data on annual visitor counts for 205 European NPs, GIS and statistical regression techniques to analyse how characteristics of NPs and their surroundings influence total annual recreational visitor numbers. The statistical model can be used for land-use planning by assessing the impact of alternative conservation scenarios on recreational use in NPs. The recreational use of new NPs can be estimated ex-ante, thereby aiding the optimisation of their location and design.\n                  We apply the model to: (1) map recreational visits to potential new NPs across Europe in order to identify best NP location; (2) map recreational visits to a proposed new NP in the west of Germany in order estimate monetary values and to show how visits are distributed across the site; and (3) predict annual visits to all NPs of 26 European countries. Total annual visits amount to more than 2 billion annually. Assuming a mean value per visit derived from 244 primary value estimates indicates that these visits result in a consumer surplus of approximately \u20ac 14.5 billion annually.", "Identifying high value areas for conservation: Accounting for connections among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats in a tropical island system ": "Functional ecosystems depend on biotic and abiotic connections among different environmental realms, including terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats. Accounting for such connections is increasingly recognized as critical for conservation of ecosystems, especially given growing understanding of the way in which anthropogenic landscape disturbances can degrade both freshwater and marine habitats. This need may be paramount in conservation planning for tropical island ecosystems, as habitats across realms are often in close proximity, and because endemic organisms utilize multiple habitats to complete life histories. In this study, we used Marxan analysis to develop conservation planning scenarios across the five largest islands of Hawaii, in one instance accounting for and in another excluding habitat connectivity between inland and coastal habitats. Native vegetation, perennial streams, and areas of biological significance along the coast were used as conservation targets in analysis. Cost, or the amount of effort required for conservation, was estimated using an index that integrated degree and intensity of anthropogenic landscape disturbances. Our results showed that when connectivity is accounted for among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats, areas identified as having high conservation value are substantially different compared to results when connectivity across realms is not considered. We also showed that the trade-off of planning conservation across realms was minimal and that cross-realm planning had the unexpected benefit of selecting areas with less habitat degradation, suggesting less effort for conservation. Our cross-realm planning approach considers biophysical interactions and complexity within and across ecosystems, as well as anthropogenic factors that may influence habitats outside of their physical boundaries, and we recommend implementing similar approaches to achieve integrated conservation efforts.", "National park affinity segments of overnight tourists differ in satisfaction with, attitudes towards, and specialization in, national parks: Results from the Bavarian Forest National Park ": "The study explored whether national-park affinity segments of tourists differ regarding their level of specialization in, attitudes towards, and satisfaction with, national parks between 2013 and 2014. The research categorized 429 overnight tourists to the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, into three affinity segments based on the role the national park played in their travel decision. More than the half of the respondents had a high or rather high national-park affinity. Differences in specialization, attitudes and satisfaction between the segments were found. However, differences were only observed between the more national park-interested segments compared to visitors who are not aware of visiting a national park or whose decision to visit the area was not influenced by the national park label, except for satisfaction. Tourists with higher national-park affinity had more positive attitudes towards, and were more specialized in, national parks and were more satisfied with nature conservation management. For satisfaction, most differences were observed between the segment with the lowest and the one with the highest affinity. Study findings may support sustainable park management and park affinity research.", "More wilderness for Germany: Implementing an important objective of Germany\u2019s National Strategy on Biological Diversity ": "There are numerous reasons for the establishment of more wilderness areas. The issue is becoming more and more important worldwide, considering the increasing natural disruption. This also applies to densely populated countries like Germany. The National Strategy on Biological Diversity (NBS) sets goals for preserving and establishing more wilderness areas in Germany: 2% of the national land territory shall be designated to become large-scale wilderness areas and 5% of the forested areas in Germany are to be preserved as permanently unused woodland (areas). There may be partial overlaps since large forest areas of unused woodland qualify for both wilderness targets.\n                  The implementation of these wilderness objectives is achieved within the political framework through public administration activities, scientific work and communication.\n                  As a result of these activities a definition for wilderness areas in Germany as well as quality criteria for large wilderness areas in Germany have been developed. Furthermore, the potential for large wilderness areas was identified on a surface-oriented basis. These potential areas cover approximately 3.5% of Germany's land territory and can be found in woodlands, watercourses, coastlines, peatlands and high mountain ranges as well as in former military training grounds or mining areas.\n                  To support the wilderness targets, the Federal Government has made 156,000 hectares of federal land available as \u2018National Natural Heritage\u2019. To date, approximately 0.6% of the national land territory is protected as large-scale wilderness areas and approximately 1.9% of the forested area is designated to be permanently unused woodland; however, there is still a gap of 1.4% (large areas) and 3.1% (forests), to fulfill the targets of the NBS.\n                  It is shown, that no starting point of the natural state can be defined for \u2018wilderness areas\u2019. For a particular area to be classifiable as a wilderness area, natural processes without or with very slight human influence must be ensured.\n                  Our analysis reveals that the goals for more wilderness areas in Germany are ambitious, but achievable. The first steps for their realization, like the establishment of specific goals, the development of specific strategies and programs by the federal states and the demonstration of a realistic potential for more wilderness areas in Germany have been taken. However, the road to reach these goals is still long, and in the following years there is a continual need for numerous concerted activities by the relevant stakeholders in the field of wilderness.", "Structured and unstructured citizen science: Seven decades of expanding bird populations in central Ontario, Canada ": "Citizens\u2019 observations of wildlife offer a wealth of information. Such data, however, may be prone to biases or inaccuracies \u2014 in particular, the over-reporting of novel species and under-reporting of common or mundane species. Few studies have assessed the relationship between unstructured and structured observations using long-term data. We compared 69 years of voluntary bird sightings, recorded in the regular publication of Peterborough Field Naturalists (PFN), 1948\u20132016, to systematic Christmas Bird Counts (CBC; during winter) and Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS; during spring) in central Ontario, Canada. We focused on seven species that had expanded their ranges into the area: Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), Purple Finch (Haemorhous purpureus), Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius). For each species, we compared the first record, the annual number of sightings, and the annual relative abundance from the PFN to the first record and annual relative abundance in the CBC and BBS. We anticipated that naturalists\u2019 accounts would be more sensitive to the arrival of novel species but would underestimate abundance as the species became common.\n                  In general, our results agreed with these predictions. In 11 of 12 cases, the naturalists detected a species well in advance of the CBC and BBS \u2014 on average by 1\u00bd decades (range: 5\u201333 years). The correlations in bird abundance between unstructured (PFN) and structured (CBC and BBS) data were variable; most were weak and negative. We found significant negative correlations for the two most common species, Northern Cardinal (winter) and House Finch (spring), as well as for Wild Turkey (winter), and a positive correlation for the rarest species, the Red-bellied Woodpecker (spring). We surmise that novelty underlies these results \u2014 that rarity increases the likelihood of reporting by non-professionals. We conclude that unstructured observations are valuable in detecting novel species, but they may be inconsistent, even inverse, indicators of the abundance of expanding species, once established.", "The change in the attitudes of Czech hunters towards Eurasian lynx: Is poaching restricting lynx population growth? ": "Even though the Eurasian lynx is a less controversial species than the wolf or brown bear, poaching remains a major cause of lynx mortality in Europe, potentially threatening population expansion in key areas. Our study was designed to explore the attitude of hunters and other stakeholders (students of secondary forestry schools and University forestry faculties) towards lynx and their experience with illegal killing of lynx in the Czech Republic. Self-administered questionnaires were addressed to local hunters and to students in 2001 and again in 2015. The survey in 2001 was conducted in two separate hunting regions of Bohemia, one where lynx have been artificially reintroduced and another in which lynx have become established through natural colonisation. In 2015 the survey was extended to two further areas where lynx have re-established themselves through natural colonisation, in the east of the Czech Republic. Altogether 415 and 922 questionnaires were completed in 2001 and 2015, respectively. The attitude of hunters towards lynx was not affected by hunting region, lynx population density or nature of the population (human re-introductions vs natural recolonisation), but attitudes became more negative in 2015 than they had been in 2001. The majority of hunters still believed that lynx had negative effects on other wildlife and 27% stated that they do not wish to co-exist with lynx. Half of secondary school students and a third of tertiary students still believe that lynx threaten roe deer stocks, even though roe and red deer are present at high density and cause extensive damage in commercial forestry. Hunters as well as forestry students had first-hand knowledge about illegal hunting of lynx. The proportion of hunters admitting to having poached lynx themselves was 10% with the proportion of repeated illegal kills made by the same person increasing between 2001 and 2015. Population modelling suggested that at least 25% of the population might be poached annually, sufficient to restrict population growth and further expansion of lynx distribution.", "The Fitness Check of the Birds and Habitats Directives: A discourse analysis of stakeholders\u2019 perspectives ": "In 2015, the European Union\u2019s Birds and Habitats Directives underwent an evaluation in which selected national stakeholders provided their perspectives on the directives\u2019 implementation. Analyzing the views of different stakeholder groups from eight European member states, this study found that these views could be synthesized into three more general perspectives. The first perspective focuses on problems, indicating that these are caused by legislative drawbacks in the directives. The second perspective holds that problems are generated by improper implementation by member states. The third perspective commends the benefits of the directives in face of the existing implementation problems. Interest groups and to a minor extent governmental bodies espoused the first perspective, and environmental non-governmental organizations especially favored the third. The struggle between these three perspectives reflects ongoing debates regarding positive and negative aspects of the directives and possibilities for improving their implementation. We conclude that the relevance and impact of conservation policies should never be seen as self-evident. In order to reach the conservation goals envisaged, continuous efforts are needed to enforce and maintain environmental legislation.", "Mass-culling of a threatened island flying fox species failed to increase fruit growers\u2019 profits and revealed gaps to be addressed for effective conservation ": "Human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) pose a growing threat to biodiversity worldwide and solutions can be as sound as the understanding of the HWC itself. Conservation biologists therefore must carefully examine their local situations to inform on which approach and strategies may be best. In this context, Mauritius implemented what may be the first mass-culls of an already threatened native species when it culled the flying fox (Pteropus niger) in 2015 and 2016 to try increase fruit producers\u2019 profits. Although the Red List category of the species consequently worsened to \u2018Endangered\u2019 and fruit production dropped substantially, a third mass-cull was decided in 2018. A critical analysis is important to draw lessons that may help to prevent recurrences particularly that HWC involving Pteropus spp. are common and set to worsen. We synthesized the best literature available locally and also elsewhere in relevant situations, to critically appraise the setting, nature, timeline of events and outcome of both completed mass-culling campaigns to explore why and how they happened so as to help towards devising better approaches to such conflicts. The idea to cull P. niger originated around 2002 and a small cull was done in 2006. The first mass-cull started immediately after Mauritius\u2019 biodiversity protection law was weakened in 2015 primarily to legalize culls of threatened native species, but still breached the law in place then. The 2016\u2009mass-cull was recommended in line with the law, but was not evidence-based and consequently did not result in improved profits of fruit producers. Appeals supported by best scientific evidence from local and international organizations and conservationists to the effect that culls will not increase fruit production, but instead further endanger the species, were ignored. To forestall recurrences here and elsewhere, it matters to recognize their precursor signs and the conditions that favoured them including why the mass-culls were not stopped. The events provide a rare opportunity to explore the strategy that was used by conservationists and open the way to propose impactful alternatives or additional actions instead. The situation also exemplifies an eroding commitment towards biodiversity conservation, eased by withdrawal from evidence-based policy that suit short term goals of election cycles at the expense of longer term environmental interests.", "Dynamics of global forest area: Results from the FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 ": "The area of land covered by forest and trees is an important indicator of environmental condition. This study presents and analyses results from the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA 2015) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. FRA 2015 was based on responses to surveys by individual countries using a common reporting framework, agreed definitions and reporting standards. Results indicated that total forest area declined by 3%, from 4128Mha in 1990 to 3999Mha in 2015. The annual rate of net forest loss halved from 7.3Mhay\u22121 in the 1990s to 3.3Mhay\u22121 between 2010 and 2015. Natural forest area declined from 3961Mha to 3721Mha between 1990 and 2015, while planted forest (including rubber plantations) increased from 168Mha to 278Mha. From 2010 to 2015, tropical forest area declined at a rate of 5.5Mhay\u22121 \u2013 only 58% of the rate in the 1990s \u2013 while temperate forest area expanded at a rate of 2.2Mhay\u22121. Boreal and sub-tropical forest areas showed little net change. Forest area expanded in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, East Asia, and Western-Central Asia, but declined in Central America, South America, South and Southeast Asia and all three regions in Africa. Analysis indicates that, between 1990 and 2015, 13 tropical countries may have either passed through their forest transitions from net forest loss to net forest expansion, or continued along the path of forest expansion that follows these transitions. Comparing FRA 2015 statistics with the findings of global and pan-tropical remote-sensing forest area surveys was challenging, due to differences in assessment periods, the definitions of forest and remote sensing methods. More investment in national and global forest monitoring is needed to provide better support for international initiatives to increase sustainable forest management and reduce forest loss, particularly in tropical countries.", "A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests ": "Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.", "Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: What, why and how? ": "This paper introduces a Special Issue of Forest Ecology and Management that includes a collection of analytical results from the 2015 Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA 2015) covering 25years of forest change (1990\u20132015). FRA 2015 builds on a series of global assessments that began in 1948 and covers change in forest area and type, volume, biomass and carbon stocking, measures of sustainable forest management, biodiversity and conservation, soil and water protective functions, wood production and a number of socio-economic variables. It covers 234 countries and territories with an emphasis on forest resource change over a twenty-five year period (1990\u20132015) and also looks forward to anticipated forest change \u2013 both as government targets for forest area and projected change (to 2030) to global production and conservation forest area (to the year 2050). This paper describes important contributions of global forest resource estimates to forest management, the methods used in the collection and analysis of FRA 2015 data and provides links to additional information resources. It discusses some of the limitations of this global dataset, some of the steps taken to improve quality and the characteristics that make this type of global data most useful. While forest area change dominates public use of the FRA, the state of the forest resource and management is critical to understanding the ecological and social values of the forest and forestry. Country level reporting not only provides insights that are only possible through national reporting but also provides greater national-level understanding and discussion of forest resource change. The papers that follow in this Special Issue provide analyses of FRA 2015 data covering a wide range of topics related to sustainable forest management and forest change.", "Changes in planted forests and future global implications ": "This paper focuses on an analysis of planted forests data from the 2015 Forests Resources Assessment of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FRA 2015). It forms one of a series of papers in the FRA 2015 special issue of this journal.\n                  While total forest area decreased from 4.28 billion hectares to 3.99 billion hectares from 1990 to 2015, with percent global forest cover dropping from 31.85% to 30.85%, the area of planted forests increased from 167.5 to 277.9 million hectares or 4.06% to 6.95% of total forest area. Increase was most rapid in the temperate zone, and regionally in East Asia, followed by Europe, North America, and Southern and Southeast Asia.\n                  However the annualised rate of increase in area of planted forests slowed in the 2010\u20132015 period to 1.2%, below the 2.4% rate suggested is needed to supply all of the world\u2019s timber and fibre needs.\n                  The majority of planted forests comprised native species with only 18\u201319% of the total area being of introduced species. Introduced species were dominant in the southern hemisphere countries of South America, Oceania and Eastern and Southern Africa where industrial forestry is dominant.\n                  Twenty countries accounted for 85% of planted forest area and a different 20 countries for 87% of planted forest roundwood supply. As with forest area, roundwood supply from planted forests also showed an increasing trend although this was based on minimal data. There was a mismatch in composition and rankings of the top 20 countries with top forest area and roundwood production suggesting that there are substantial opportunities to increase roundwood production in the future, especially in China which has the largest area but is currently ranked 3rd in roundwood production.\n                  Outlook statements were developed for the FAO sub regions based on past changes in planted forest area, population growth, and climate and forest health risks to identify key issues for the future. The overall view from this study suggests that climate impacts, especially from extreme climatic events will affect planted forests in the future and that forest health impacts can also be expected to increase. Outlooks vary regionally. Europe and North America are likely to be most concerned with climate and health risks; Asia will experience population pressure that will impact on land availability for new forests and risks from extreme weather events, and will need to make the most of its existing forests; Africa will need to increase planted forest area to offset continuing deforestation and rapid population growth; and Oceania, the Caribbean, Central and South America are likely to be most concerned with climate impacts.\n                  To ensure the continued contribution of planted forests, a number of responses will be required to both maintain existing and also to develop new forests. Intensification of production in existing forests will lessen the need for greater forest areas and offset any land use conflicts related to food security; climate adaptation strategies will need to be developed as a matter of urgency, and forest health focus must remain a priority for research. Establishment of new forests will be eased through greater community and stakeholder engagement. Application of models such as WWF\u2019s New Generation Plantations, which recognises the importance of society and the need to consider the full range of forest products and services within the wider landscape and spectrum of land uses, will be important.\n                  We recommend that to enable deeper analysis related to planted forests future FRA Assessments consider ways to better gather data specific to planted forests such as productivity so that this important component of global forests can be better understood.", "Tamm Review: Re-imagining forestry and wood business: pathways to rural development, poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation in the tropics ": "Millions of people are dependent on tropical forests for livelihood. However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships.\n                  Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments.\n                  To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to re-imagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation.", "Finding the sweet spot: Shifting optimal climate for maple syrup production in North America ": "Climate change is affecting the benefits society derives from forests. One such forest ecosystem service is maple syrup, which is primarily derived from Acer saccharum (sugar maple), currently an abundant and widespread tree species in eastern North America. Two climate sensitive components of sap affect syrup production: sugar content and sap flow. The sugar in maple sap derives from carbohydrate stores influenced by prior year growing season conditions. Sap flow is tied to freeze/thaw cycles during early spring. Predicting climate effects on syrup production thus requires integrating observations across scales and biological processes. We observed sap at 6 sugar maple stands spanning sugar maple\u2019s latitudinal range over 2\u20136\u202fyears to predict the role of climate variation on sugar content and sap flow. We found that the timing of sap collection advanced by 4.3\u202fdays for every 1\u202f\u00b0C increase in March mean temperature, sap volume peaked at a January-May mean temperature of 1\u202f\u00b0C, and sap sugar content declined by 0.1 \u00b0Brix for every 1\u202f\u00b0C increase in previous May-October mean temperature. Using these empirical relationships, we projected that the sap collection season midpoint will be 1\u202fmonth earlier and sap sugar content will decline by 0.7 \u00b0Brix across sugar maple\u2019s range by the year 2100 in an RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. The region of maximum sap flow is expected to shift northward by 400\u202fkm, from near the 43rd parallel to the 48th parallel by 2100. Our findings suggest climate change will have profound effects on syrup yield across most of sugar maple\u2019s range; drastic shifts in the timing of the tapping season accompanied by flat to moderate increases in syrup yield per tap in Canada contrast with declines in syrup yield and higher frequencies of poor syrup production years across most of the U.S. range.", "Status and trends in global primary forest, protected areas, and areas designated for conservation of biodiversity from the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 ": "The global community has recognized the importance of forests for biodiversity, and has prioritized the preservation of forest biodiversity and ecosystem functions through multiple multilateral agreements and processes such as the Convention on Biodiversity\u2019s Aichi Targets and the Millennium Development Goals. The Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) provides one mechanism for tracking progress toward such goals in three particular areas: primary forest area, protected forest areas, and areas designated for the conservation of biodiversity. In this paper, we quantify current area and trends in forest areas designated for the conservation of biodiversity, protected forest areas, and primary forests by country and biome; and examine the association between total forest area and measures of protection, per-capita income, and population. The overall findings suggest that countries are increasingly protecting forests of ecological significance at the global scale (7.7% of forests were protected in 1990 rising to 16.3% in 2015), with a strong upward trend in protected areas in the tropical domain (from 12% in 1990 to 26.3% in 2015). However, primary forest area has declined by 2.5% globally and by 10% in the tropics over the period 1990\u20132015 (using data for countries that reported in all years). Given that many species in the tropics are endemic to primary forests, losses in that climatic domain continue to be of concern, although the rate of decline appears to be slowing.\n                  Using multiple regression analysis, we find that a 1% increase in protected area or area designated for biodiversity conservation within a country is associated with an increase in total forest area in that country of about 0.03% (p\n                     <0.05). A 1% within-country increase in population density and per capita GDP are associated with a decrease in forest area of about 0.2% (p\n                     <0.01) and an increase in forest area of about 0.08% (p\n                     <0.05) respectively. Our findings also indicate that, since FRA is used as one mechanism for tracking progress toward goals like the AICHI Biodiversity Targets, country correspondents may require additional assistance toward reporting on primary forest, protected forest, and biodiversity conservation statistics.", "Forest Resources Assessment of 2015 shows positive global trends but forest loss and degradation persist in poor tropical countries ": "The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 shows that deforestation has slowed and afforestation has increased globally during 1990\u20132015. Planted forests have increasingly provided goods and services hitherto derived from natural forests, and mosaic forests in agricultural landscapes are increasing. Forest gain is occurring at higher latitudes and in richer countries whilst forest loss continues in poor countries in the tropics. Some middle income tropical countries are now also transitioning to forest gain. These transition countries are characterised by reforms to forest management and improvements in agricultural practices but also by significant expansions of planted forest, which account for \u223c25\u2013100% of gains. Forest-area estimates of the FRA align with satellite-derived estimates, with deviations of \u2a7d\u00b17% globally and \u2a7d\u00b117% for the tropics. Mosaics comprised of trees outside forests, remnant forest patches, and young regenerating forests constitute a modest proportion of the tropical forest estate and are seemingly well inventoried by the FRA. Extensive areas of forest experienced partial canopy cover reduction since 2000, particularly in the tropics where their area is \u223c6.5 times that deforested since 1990. The likelihood of the eventual loss of these forests and a decline in their capacity to provide goods and services is a matter of concern. Demand for industrial wood and fuelwood increased 35% in the tropics since 1990, principally in poorer countries, and growth in demand will accelerate into the future, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Notwithstanding significant increases in forests within protected areas since 1990 to 517Mha (16.3%) globally and 379Mha (26.6%) in the tropics, increasing demands for ecological services, forest products, and climate change mitigation is likely to be met from an expanding area of planted forests more than from the declining area of natural forests, particularly in Africa. The global rate of planted-forest expansion since 1990 is close to a target rate of 2.4% per annum necessary to replace wood supplied from natural forests in the medium term, though the expansion rate has declined to 1.5% since 2005. Multiple-use forests permitting both production and conservation account for 26% of the global forest area and 17% of the tropical forest area, and have increased by 81.8Mha or 8.5% globally since 1990, with most gains in the tropics. Sustainable forest management in low-income and tropical countries remains modest, with only 37% low-income country forests covered by forest inventories. International support has proven effective at increasing this coverage since 2010.", "Climate change impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability of European forest ecosystems ": "This study compiles and summarizes the existing knowledge about observed and projected impacts of climate change on forests in Europe. Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short\u2013medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks.\n                  Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged.\n                  Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit.", "Global progress toward sustainable forest management ": "Sustainable forest management (SFM) is many things to many people \u2013 yet a common thread is the production of forest goods and services for the present and future generations. The promise of sustainability is rooted in the two premises; first that ecosystems have the potential to renew themselves and second that economic activities and social perceptions or values that define human interaction with the environment are choices that can be modified to ensure the long term productivity and health of the ecosystem. SFM addresses a great challenge in matching the increasing demands of a growing human population while maintaining ecological functions of healthy forest ecosystems. This paper does not seek to define SFM, but rather provides analyses of key indicators for the national-scale enabling environment to gain a global insight into progress in implementing enabling and implementing SFM at the national and operational levels. Analyses of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA) country report data are used to provide insights into the current state of progress in implementing the enabling conditions for SFM. Over 2.17 billion ha of the world\u2019s forest area are predicted by governments to remain in permanent forest land use, of which some 1.1 billion ha are covered by all of the SFM tools investigated in FRA 2015. At the global scale, SFM-related policies and regulations are reported to be in place on 97% of global forest area. While the number of countries with national forest inventories has increased over that past ten years from 48 to 112, only 37% of forests in low income countries are covered by forest inventories. Forest management planning and monitoring of plans has increased substantially as has forest management certification, which exceeded a total of over 430 million ha in 2014. However, 90% of internationally verified certification is in the boreal and temperate climatic domains \u2013 only 6% of permanent forests in the tropical domain have been certified as of 2014. Results show that more work is needed to expand the extent and depth of work on establishing the enabling conditions that support SFM over the long term and suggests where those needs are greatest.", "Linking forest growth with stand structure: Tree size inequality, tree growth or resource partitioning and the asymmetry of competition ": "Stand structure can strongly influence forest growth and other processes, such as the water balance, carbon partitioning, nutrient cycling and light dynamics. However, individual structural variables can be positively or negatively correlated with growth. This is the case for variables such as size inequality and those that describe resource partitioning, such as the degree of symmetric/asymmetric competition and growth dominance. Several contrasting growth-structure correlations are reviewed and linked to forest processes by considering the different types of tree interactions they are associated with. Contrasting growth-structure correlations appear to converge when they are examined using a simple framework where stand growth is a function of three variables as opposed to any one of the variables alone; stand density, size distributions and tree size-growth relationships. The size distributions quantify how the stand density is distributed between the different sizes while the size-growth relationships quantify how growth is partitioned between different sizes. Size inequality may not often be a useful explanatory variable and instead it appears to sometimes correlate with growth because it can be correlated with other variables that influence growth. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the effects of structure on growth have received little attention and a long-term growth and yield data set from central Europe was used to examine how the effects of structure can change along climatic gradients. The simple framework of three variables could be used to separate the effects of structure and functioning when comparing mixed and monospecific forests, as well as to design silvicultural interventions or to determine whether past management interventions have achieved their goals. The implications for selecting which structural variables to use and when scaling up to the stand level, are also discussed.", "Reduced-impact logging for climate change mitigation (RIL-C) can halve selective logging emissions from tropical forests ": "Selective logging causes at least half of the emissions from tropical forest degradation. Reduced-impact logging for climate (RIL-C) is proposed as a way to maintain timber production while minimizing forest damage. Here we synthesize data from 61 coordinated field-based surveys of logging impacts in seven countries across the tropics. We estimate that tropical selective logging emitted 834 Tg CO2 in 2015, 6% of total tropical greenhouse gas emissions. Felling, hauling, and skidding caused 59%, 31%, and 10% of these emissions, respectively. We suggest that RIL-C incentive programs consider a feasible target carbon impact factor of 2.3\u202fMg emitted per Mg of timber extracted. Operational modifications are needed to achieve this target, such as reduced wood waste, narrower haul roads, and lower impact skidding equipment. Full implementation would reduce logging emissions by 44% (366 Tg CO2 year\u22121) and deliver 4% of the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Climate Agreement from tropical countries, while maintaining timber supplies.", "Projecting global forest area towards 2030 ": "There is strong interest in gaining an informed view of changes likely to occur in forest area and the impacts of these changes on production forestry and forest conservation. Despite the complexity of underlying causes, it is largely accepted that deforestation is mainly focused in the tropics and driven by conversion to agriculture. Similarly, energy demand and GDP are largely determining wood consumption and production. Based on these assumptions, we built a model predicting natural forests and planted forests\u2019 evolution in the next 15years, and compared the results of the modelling with survey results from country expertise. The results suggest that on a global level, forest resources loss is likely to slow down. The forests that are most at risk of conversion were clearly identified within the tropical domain, while the forest under protected areas showed very little risk of being converted to other land uses in the near future.", "Effects of understory fire management treatments on California Hazelnut, an ecocultural resource of the Karuk and Yurok Indians in the Pacific Northwest ": "Before widespread fire exclusion policies, American Indians used broadcast understory fires or cultural burns to enhance resources integral for their livelihood and cultural practices. To restore ecocultural resources depleted from decades of fire exclusion and to reduce wildfire risks, the Karuk and the Yurok Tribes of Northwest California are leading regional collaborative efforts to expand broadcast fires and fuel reduction treatments on public, private, and Tribal lands in their ancestral territories. Through collaboration with Karuk and Yurok Tribal members and basketweavers, we evaluated the effects of broadcast fires and three fire proxy treatments on California hazelnut shrubs (Corylus cornuta var. californica) that produce highly valued ecocultural resources for basketry materials. Across a 10\u202fha Douglas-fir and mixed hardwood forest (500\u202fm a.s.l.) in the Klamath mountains, we established 27 stratified blocks (16\u202fm2) and within each block applied three fire proxy treatments designed and used by Tribal members with an untreated control. These treatments involved manual hazelnut stem cutting, directly blistering hazelnut stems via propane torch, and igniting surface fuels piled within hazelnut shrubs to top-kill stems. Broadcast fire was applied to 12 separate blocks. After a full growing season (12\u201318\u202fmonths post-treatment/burn), shrubs were re-measured. We then harvested these stems (n\u202f=\u202f604; 50 shrubs) across treatments and compared results with stems gathered independently by two experienced Karuk/Yurok basketweavers (n\u202f=\u202f396 and n\u202f=\u202f73) from an adjacent broadcast burned site. Compared to the untreated shrubs, pile burning, propane torching, and broadcast burning increased basketry stem production by 7\u201310 fold (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), while the cutting treatment increased production by 4-fold (p\u202f=\u202f0.006). Shrubs with relatively greater access to sunlight (southern aspect, \u226551% and <70% canopy cover) produced fewer quality stems when compared to shrubs with an eastern aspect (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and \u226570% canopy cover (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Harvested stems across all treatments displayed similar stem length distributions to those gathered by one of the two basketweavers (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Our results demonstrate that these fire-proxy methods are an effective means to increase the production and quality of basketry materials. Expanding the area and frequency of targeted understory fire-based forest treatments on private, public and Tribal lands in California and the Pacific Northwest would substantially increase the availability of these fire-enhanced ecocultural resources that are currently limited in supply and in high demand.", "Utilizing a topographic moisture index to characterize understory vegetation patterns in the boreal forest ": "For the purpose of informing biodiversity conservation efforts in managed landscapes, we explored whether and how understory plant communities (abundance, diversity, composition) were related to a topographic moisture index, called depth-to-water, in the boreal mixedwood forests of northwestern Alberta. Depth-to-water is an index of relative site moisture derived from the Wet Areas Mapping tool using a fine-scale digital elevation model based upon remotely-sensed lidar (light detection and ranging) data. Sample plots were placed along the depth-to-water moisture gradient in three forest types: conifer-dominated, mixedwood, and broadleaf -(deciduous) dominated. Understory vascular plant diversity, abundance, and composition were measured for each plot. We found understory attributes were related to the depth-to-water index with the relationships varying among forest types. In coniferous stands, diversity and abundance (cover) were higher on drier sites. In broadleaf and mixedwood stands, understory abundance was higher on drier sites, but diversity was not related to the depth-to-water index. Lastly, composition was significantly, but weakly, related to the depth-to-water index in all three forest types. Our study shows that this moisture index, based on remotely-sensed data, can be used to characterize patterns in understory vascular plant communities; hence it can be useful for identifying areas of particular interest for conservation or management.", "Changes in forest production, biomass and carbon: Results from the 2015 UN FAO Global Forest Resource Assessment ": "Forests are important sources of livelihoods to millions of people and contribute to national economic development of many countries. In addition, they are vital sources and sinks of carbon and contribute to the rate of climate change. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has been collecting and presenting data on global forest resources and forest cover since 1948. This paper builds on data from FAO\u2019s 2015 Global Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) and presents information on growing stock, biomass, carbon stock, wood removals, and changes of forest area primarily designated for production and multiple use of the world\u2019s forests.\n                  Between 1990 and 2015, the total growing stock volume has increased in East Asia, Caribbean, Western and Central Asia, North America, Europe (including the Russian Federation), and Oceania with the highest relative increase in East Asia and the Caribbean. In all other subregions the total growing stock volume decreased. North and Central America, Europe and Asia report forest C stock increases while South America and Africa report strong decreases and Oceania reports stable forest C stocks. The annual rate of decrease of forest C stock weakened between 1990 and 2015.\n                  The total volume of annual wood removals including woodfuel removals increased between 1990 and 2011, but shows a remarkable decline during the 2008\u20132009 economic crisis.\n                  Forest areas designated for production purposes differ considerably between subregions. The percentage of production area out of total forest area ranges between 16 percent in South America and 53 percent in Europe. Globally about one quarter of the forest area is designated to multiple use forestry.\n                  The balance between biomass growth and removals shows considerable sub-regional differences and related implications for the sustainable use of forests.", "Tamm Review: Direct seeding to restore oak (Quercus spp.) forests and woodlands ": "The scale of opportunity to implement forest restoration exceeds billions of ha worldwide, and a part of this area in northern temperate regions includes formerly oak (Quercus spp.)-dominated ecosystems. The cost of achieving restoration is often high, and tends to increase with severity of ecosystem degradation. Therefore, it is important to develop cost-efficient regeneration practices to support forest restoration. Direct seeding of acorns, one of the earliest artificial forest regeneration techniques developed, offers several benefits including costs that can be about a third of planting oak seedlings. However, direct seeding is presently a more uncertain practice for establishing oak forests and woodlands than is planting seedlings. Much of this uncertainty can be a result of acorn depredation by rodents even though other factors may also limit oak establishment. This review provides a synthesis of foundational knowledge, particularly from Europe and North America, pertaining to the biology and ecology of acorn production, acorn germination, early seedling growth, and acorn depredation by granivorous rodents. We build on this knowledge to review research on operational direct seeding practices and four basic strategies for acorn depredation control (chemical, ecological, physical and silvicultural). We suggest that environmentally sound approaches to minimize acorn depredation and increase seedling establishment currently exists. For example, seeding operations probably hold higher chances for success if scheduled during years of high masting, if applied on open sites (areas with little shrub and tree cover), and if acorn lots are sized and sown at an appropriate depth. Several gaps in our knowledge limit the development of improved operational practices for broader success. We lack information on basic acorn biology and proper handling and storage practices for many of the oaks around the world. And, we need research to support development of new techniques or combinations of strategies and techniques that minimize acorn depredation under a wide range of site conditions. Nevertheless, our synthesis suggests that direct seeding will remain a cost-effective and environmentally sound practice for oak forest and woodland establishment, and it will likely gain expanded use as future research informs innovation that increases seed availability, decreases acorn depredation, and raises predictability of oak seedling establishment.", "Structure and dynamics of forests dominated by Sequoiadendron giganteum\n             ": "The largest tree species, Sequoiadendron giganteum has a small native range restricted to California\u2019s Sierra Nevada. Awe-inspiring stature contributed to its protection from logging, but anthropogenic climate change\u2014particularly hotter drought\u2014and over a century of fire suppression are possible threats. We measured 60 trees in seven forests to improve allometric equations for the species and installed five 1-ha plots to quantify biomass of Sequoiadendron and associated vegetation. Plots were re-measured after 5\u202fyr to compute biomass increments and examine effects of management history as well as impacts of recent drought. Forests held up to 2683\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121 aboveground biomass (1373\u202fMg\u202fC\u202fha\u22121) and had leaf area index (LAI) up to 14.5 with Sequoiadendron accounting for the bulk of biomass but not LAI. Live trees of other species contributed up to 10.6 LAI and had biomass increments up to 6.1\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121\u202fyr\u22121, but drought contributed to tree mortality in three plots, where live biomass declined by 6.2\u201310.3\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121\u202fyr\u22121. Two plots had very little tree mortality and gained 5.5\u20137.9\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121\u202fyr\u22121. Sequoiadendron productivity was strongly correlated with tree-level photosynthetic capacity, but at the height of the drought, relative growth\u2014expressed as the ratio of biomass produced during the driest and wettest recent years\u2014correlated positively with site productivity and negatively with both vertical distance to water and presumed competition from neighboring trees. Prescribed fire in one plot caused a growth release in trees whose lower trunks were burnt and small neighboring Abies lowiana were killed. Effects of 21st century drought on Sequoiadendron productivity were greater in northern than southern locations but of lesser magnitude than many past events. No Sequoiadendron recruitment was observed. Planting can overcome the species\u2019 dependence on fire for regeneration, and Sequoiadendron has great potential for carbon sequestration in a variety of settings, including commercial forestry.", "The evolving threat of Rapid \u2018\u014chi\u2018a Death (ROD) to Hawai\u2018i\u2019s native ecosystems and rare plant species ": "Hawai\u2018i\u2019s most widespread native tree, \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), has been dying across large areas of Hawai\u2018i Island mainly due to two fungal pathogens (Ceratocystis lukuohia and Ceratocystis huliohia) that cause a disease collectively known as Rapid \u2018\u014chi\u2018a Death (ROD). Here we examine patterns of positive detections of C. lukuohia as it has been linked to the larger mortality events across Hawai\u2018i Island. Our analysis compares the environmental range of C. lukuohia and its spread over time through the known climatic range and distribution of \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a. Analyses show this fungal pathogen generally encompassed the core, but not the extremes of the climatic range of \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a. We further modeled the potential distribution of C. lukuohia across the Hawaiian Archipelago to estimate the risk of ROD to other islands. Given the potential for C. lukuohia to alter the structure of \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a dominated forests, we used our projected potential distribution of C. lukuohia to assess the risk of ROD to threatened and endangered plant species across Hawai\u2018i. Many native plants are likely vulnerable to these types of large \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a mortality events: of 234 endangered native plant species considered, 147 (62.8%) have more than half of their range within current and expanding C. lukuohia suitable areas. We also found evidence that protecting habitat by fencing out introduced feral ungulates reduces the prevalence of the disease likely by reducing physical damage caused by these animals to \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a trees, a precondition for Ceratocystis infection. Given the ongoing spread of C. lukuohia, we developed a dynamic web portal to host our results online, where models and analyses are updated with new lab-confirmed detections to provide managers with a useful tool to help monitor and assess the risk of C. lukuohia as it continues to spread.", "Wood density reduced while wood volume growth accelerated in Central European forests since 1870 ": "Forest stand growth dynamics in Central Europe have accelerated since 1870 due to a rise in temperature, extended growing seasons, and other components of climate change. Based on wood samples from the oldest existing experimental plots in Central Europe, we show that the dominant tree species Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.) exhibit a significant decrease in wood density since more than 100\u202fyears. While stand and trees grow faster with respect to wood volume, we can show that wood density decreased by 8\u201312% since 1900. These results object a na\u00efve direct transformation of volume growth trends into an accelerated biomass production. Since 1900, stand biomass increment increased 9\u201324 percentage points less compared to volume increment (29\u2013100% increase reduces to 20\u201376%). For a given stem diameter and annual ring width, tree stability against windthrow, wood strength, energy content and C sequestration are even reduced under recent conditions. The generally decreased late wood density, partly going along with an increased early wood fraction, suggests the observed extension of the growing season and fertilization effect of dry deposition as the main causes.\n                  Our results indicate that current increased wood volume growth rates must not be straightforwardly converted into sequestrated C and biomass harvest potentials assuming historic values for wood density. This should be taken into account in monitoring, modeling, and utilization of carbon and biomass in forests under global change.", "Genetic considerations in ecosystem restoration using native tree species ": "Rehabilitation and restoration of forest ecosystems are in growing demand to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and desertification\u2014major environmental problems of our time. Interest in restoration of ecosystems is increasingly translated into strong political commitment to large-scale tree planting projects. Along with this new impetus and the enormous scale of planned projects come both opportunities and risks: opportunities to significantly increase the use of native species, and risks of failure associated with the use of inadequate or mismatched reproductive material, which though it may provide forest cover in the short term, will not likely establish a self-sustaining ecosystem. The value of using native tree species in ecosystem restoration is receiving growing recognition both among restoration practitioners and policy makers. However, insufficient attention has been given to genetic variation within and among native tree species, their life histories and the consequences of their interactions with each other and with their environment. Also restoration practitioners have often neglected to build in safeguards against the anticipated effects of anthropogenic climate change. Measurement of restoration success has tended to be assessments of hectares covered or seedling survival in a short timeframe, neither of which is an indicator of ecosystem establishment in the long term. In this article, we review current practices in ecosystem restoration using native tree species, with a particular focus on genetic considerations. Our discussion is organised across three themes: (i) species selection and the sourcing of forest reproductive material; (ii) increasing resilience by fostering natural selection, ecological connectivity and species associations; and (iii) measuring the success of restoration activities. We present a number of practical recommendations for researchers, policymakers and restoration practitioners to increase the potential for successful interventions. We recommend the development and adoption of decision-support tools for: (i) collecting and propagating germplasm in a way that ensures a broad genetic base of restored tree populations, including planning the sourcing of propagation material of desired species well before the intended planting time; (ii) matching species and provenances to restoration sites based on current and future site conditions, predicted or known patterns of variation in adaptive traits and availability of seed sources; and (iii) landscape-level planning in restoration projects.", "On promoting the use of lidar systems in forest ecosystem research ": "Forest structure is an important driver of ecosystem dynamics, including the exchange of carbon, water and energy between canopies and the atmosphere. Structural descriptors are also used in numerous studies of ecological processes and ecosystem services. Over the last 20+ years, lidar technology has fundamentally changed the way we observe and describe forest structure, and it will continue to impact the ways in which we investigate and monitor the relations between forest structure and functions. Here we present the currently available lidar system types (ground, air, and space-based), we highlight opportunities and challenges associated with each system, as well as challenges associated with a wider use of lidar technology and wider availability of lidar derived products. We also suggest pathways for lidar to further contribute to addressing questions in forest ecosystem science and increase benefits to a wider community of researchers.", "Canopy space filling and tree crown morphology in mixed-species stands compared with monocultures ": "Mixed-species forest stands are well explored in their favourable ecological, economical, and socio-economical functions and services compared with pure stands, but still poorly understood in their structure and functioning. Canopy structure and tree morphology affect the environmental conditions within the stand, the tree growth, and by this most forest functions and services. Here, I review how canopy structure and crown morphology in mixed stands can differ from pure stands and how this depends on the selection of tree species and interactions between them. The focus is on the macrostructure of canopy and crowns derived from the trees\u2019 positions, their convex crown hulls, and their space filling with branches.\n                  In mixed canopies the sum of the crown projection area, but not the ground coverage by crowns, mostly exceeds pure stands due to multiple crown overlaps. The interspecific differences in crown shape and allometric scaling cause a \u2018selection effect\u2019 when complementary species are combined. In interspecific environment furthermore \u2018true mixing effects\u2019 like intraspecific shifts in size, shape, and inner space filling of crowns may occur. The much denser and more plastic canopy space filling in mixed stands may increase light interception, stand density, productivity, and growth resilience to disturbances. I discuss the relevance of interspecific interactions for forest management, model building, and theory development and draw perspectives of further research into stand canopy and crown structure.", "Modeling the height-diameter relationship of planted Pinus kesiya in Zambia ": "Plantations of non-native tree species cover over 50,000\u202fha in Zambia of which Pinus kesiya accounts for 36% of the main tree species. In order to quantify the growing stock of P. kesiya, updated and reliable height-diameter (h-d) models are required. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop appropriate h-d models for P. kesiya that are consistent with current forest management practices in the country. Using 7691 measured pairs of diameter and height of P. kesiya from four different forest sites, the following questions were investigated; (i) do frequently used h-d models accurately estimate height of P. kesiya in Zambia?; and (ii) what h-d models account for site and rotation in the country? Predicted h from the frequently used h-d models (N\u00e4slund, Modified Logistic and Hossfeld) was significantly lower than the measured h (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001). This suggests that frequently used h-d models for pine significantly underestimates tree height of P. kesiya in Zambia. The deviations associated with these models varied but generally increased with tree diameter. In this regard, country level h-d model developed using the Weibull function, and tested in this study proved to be more accurate than the frequently used models in predicting tree height of P. kesiya in Zambia. Furthermore, site and rotation were found to influence the overall accuracy and reliability of the country level model (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001) suggesting the need to refine this model in order to account for site and/or rotation effect. Therefore, the h-d models that are specific to site and in some instances to rotation were derived and increased the accuracy and precision in estimating tree height of P. kesiya in the country. These locally developed h-d models are recommended for future forest plantation inventories, management planning and as a basis for modeling h-d relationships for other Pinus species in the country.", "Overstory trees in excess: A threat to restoration success in Brazilian Atlantic forest ": "Tree planting is the most widely used technique for tropical forest restoration because it accelerates the recovery of forest structure and ecosystem functioning. Despite the importance of tree size distribution to the ecological function and habitat quality of restored forests, it has received little attention. Here we ask if the structure of reference forests has been recovered by planting tree seedlings and discuss the implications of skewed tree-size distributions for sustainability of restored forests. We sampled 11 tropical forest sites that had undergone restoration for between 16 and 53\u202fyears after planting tree seedlings and nine reference ecosystems (old-growth, secondary and degraded forests) in Brazilian Atlantic forest, and compared them by the abundance of individuals in five diameter classes. Restored forests presented 83% greater abundance of large trees (>20\u202fcm DBH), 41% lower abundance of saplings (1\u202f\u2264\u202fDBH\u202f<\u202f5\u202fcm) and 43% lower abundance of small trees (5\u202f\u2264\u202fDBH\u202f<\u202f10\u202fcm). The abundance of smaller individuals (DBH\u202f<\u202f1\u202fcm), however, did not differ between restored and reference forests, indicating successful colonization of the understorey. Low mortality in the large class (DBH\u202f\u2265\u202f20\u202fcm) results in excess of big trees, which constrains recruitment of small plants to the intermediate size classes, likely due to asymmetric competition for light. The excess of large trees demonstrates that gap dynamics can take longer to naturally re-establish in these even-aged forests, likely due to the high density of long-lived trees planted at the same time. Thinning may be a possible adaptive-management strategy to reduce the density of big trees and stimulate recruitment of intermediate size classes.", "Learning technical words through L1 and L2: Completeness and accuracy of word meanings ": "This paper investigates the quality of knowledge of technical words that high-school students learned from subject reading. In particular, it focuses on similarities and differences between students who learned new words through their L1 and their L2. In the study, 72 students were divided into two groups and asked to read and listen to two expository texts. One group received the texts in their L1 (Slovak) and the other group in their L2 (English). Afterwards the participants were tested on their knowledge of twelve technical words that appeared in the texts. The responses were examined in terms of the completeness of word meaning and the presence of errors. The results showed that compared to the L1-instructed students, the L2-instructed participants provided word meanings that were less complete and less precise. Word meanings from both groups contained errors involving omission of correct meaning components and inclusion of incorrect meaning components. L2-instructed participants made more errors of both kinds. The differences between the two groups are discussed with respect to vocabulary acquisition and subject learning.", "Sources of college EFL learners' self-efficacy in the English public speaking domain ": "The English language is playing an ever-increasing role in global cultural, political, and economic domains. This underscores a rapidly growing need for good English public speaking (EPS) skills among college students and a need to better understand instructionally manipulable factors, such as self-efficacy, that may contribute to EPS skills development. Grounded in Bandura's self-efficacy theory, this study investigated the degree to which four sources of self-efficacy\u2014 enactive mastery experience (EME), vicarious experience (VE), verbal persuasion (VP), and physiological and affective states (PAS)\u2014predicted EPS self-efficacy among 263 adult Chinese English as a foreign language learners. The overall results in the combined sample largely support Bandura's hypothesized sources of self-efficacy, with EME, VE, and VP\u2014but not PAS\u2014significantly making unique contributions to predicting EPS self-efficacy. The results by subsample highlight prior EPS course experience, gender, and academic major as factors that may impact the existence and the magnitude of the relationship between self-efficacy and its theoretical sources. This is particularly important for educators who wish to foster their students' EPS self-efficacy beliefs as the findings suggest that different groups of students may respond differently to their instructors' efforts. Pedagogical recommendations for EPS self-efficacy building are discussed.", "Using corpus-based discourse analysis for curriculum development: Creating and evaluating a pronunciation course for internationally educated nurses ": "This paper discusses the development of corpus-based curriculum for ESP, with a focus on two underresearched areas: health care communication and the use of corpus materials for pronunciation. Three aspects of corpus-based curriculum development are explored: corpus-based needs analysis; corpus-based materials development; and corpus-based assessment and evaluation (Flowerdew, 2012; Tono, 2011). First, this paper briefly reports on a quantitative corpus-based analysis of 104 nurse-patient interactions that was conducted to identify needs of nurses in clinical interactions, with a focus on the findings related to pronunciation (pitch range, tone choice, and prominence/sentence stress). Key differences were found between international and U.S. nurse discourse in the use of these features. Next, the paper describes the curriculum for a Pronunciation for Nurses course, with an emphasis on corpus-based materials development from the corpus described above. Finally, the paper discusses the corpus-based assessment of participants' progress and an evaluation of the Pronunciation for Nurses curriculum, including pre and post-tests, interviews with nurse participants, interviews with ESL teachers, and course evaluations. The methods discussed in the paper have implications for other ESP contexts and other aspects of language use.", "Using English for International Business: A European case study ": "With the continuing globalisation of markets and internationalisation of trade, professionals from a wide range of organisations, from large multinational corporations to small to medium size enterprises, are increasingly coming together to do business in the international workplace, particularly in meetings. Such international events usually bring together people from different linguistic and socio-cultural backgrounds with the result that a common language of communication is frequently adopted. More often than not this lingua franca is English. While English for International Business (EIB) has an essential function as a lingua franca in multilingual settings, it can also present challenges both linguistically and culturally, particularly as more and more interactions are between speakers whose first language is not English.\n                  This paper reports on preliminary research which forms part of a larger scale study investigating the use of English as a lingua franca in international business meetings. The paper summarises the findings of a questionnaire exploring the use of EIB by a particular European business organisation. It is hoped that the limited findings will help shed light on some of the language issues that may be present in such international contexts and the possible communications difficulties and frustrations that can result. A positive result is that as well as uncovering some of these challenges, the analysis also shows an awareness by many participants of some of the strategies that can be used to overcome them.", "Friend or foe? Google Translate in language for academic purposes ": "A recent development in digital technology, machine translation (MT), is improving in its ability to translate with grammatical and lexical accuracy, and is also becoming increasingly available for students of language for academic purposes. Given the acceptance of other digital technology for teaching and learning, it seems likely that machine translation will become a tool students will rely on to complete their assignments in a second language. This would have implications for the community of practice of academic language teaching. In this study students were asked to submit an essay in their first language and this was then translated into English through a web-based translation engine. The resulting English text was analysed for grammatical error. The analysis found that the translation engine was far from able to produce error-free text \u2013 however, judging in relation to international testing standards, the level of accuracy is approaching the minimum needed for university admission at many institutions. Thus, this paper sets out to argue, based on the assumption that MT will continue to improve, that this technology will have a profound influence on the teaching of Languages for Academic Purposes, and with imaginative use, will allow this influence to be positive for both the students and their instructors.", "Teaching master thesis writing to engineers: Insights from corpus and genre analysis of introductions ": "A large proportion of all graduates study engineering disciplines, and the number of master theses completed far outstrips that of doctoral-level works. However, engineering disciplines in general and their master theses in particular have received comparatively little attention from applied linguistics, leaving writing instructors with sparse guidance when preparing courses for MSc students in engineering. Here, we present the results of a corpus analysis of introduction sections in 57 master theses in mechanical engineering and a genre analysis of 16 of their introductions. A concordance analysis of the most frequent keywords revealed the typical discourse functions employed by students when writing about their research in this section. The genre analysis confirmed the presence of most of the elements of Swales's CARS schema in MSc theses. These findings contribute to knowledge of this understudied field in applied linguistics and can be used to design materials and courses for MSc engineering students focussing on vocabulary, rhetorical structures, and academic socialisation.", "Academic oral communication needs of East Asian international graduate students in non-science and non-engineering fields ": "East Asian students, the largest international student group in US higher education, are as a group typically known to be silent or reticent in class. This survey examined views of East Asian international graduate students concerning required academic listening and speaking skill levels in their university courses, their own difficulties in meeting these expectations, and their suggestions as to the ways in which English for Academic Purposes (EAP) teachers might better prepare them through listening and speaking activities. Students reported that, in their graduate courses, the three most common academic oral classroom activities were participating in whole-class discussions, raising questions during class, and engaging in small-group discussions. They were most concerned about leading class discussions and participating in whole-class discussions. They considered formal oral presentations and listening comprehension the most important skills for academic success in graduate courses, and pronunciation of English and note-taking skills the least important. Several important issues and specific pedagogical suggestions for EAP instructions, curriculum planning and material development emerged from the current study.", "Assessing the accuracy and teachers' impressions of Google Translate: A study of primary L2 writers in Hong Kong ": "", "English as a lingua franca in international business contexts ": "This article will provide an overview of current research focussing on the use of English as a lingua franca in international business contexts. It selectively reviews research investigating the role of written and spoken communication in English and the work that has been done on specific text genres used by the international business community, such as negotiations, meetings, e-mail and advertising. The use of English as a means of communication within the business world will be discussed with specific reference to the work of the researchers showcased in this Special Issue, and there is also a discussion of the implications of these and other research findings for the teaching of English for Specific Business Purposes.", "Thesis and dissertation writing: an examination of published advice and actual practice ": "This article explores the extent to which published advice on the organisation and structure of theses and dissertations concurs with what happens in actual practice. The study examines guides and handbooks which focus on thesis and dissertation writing and postgraduate research. The sample texts examined were master's and doctoral theses written in a number of different study areas at a major research university. The study found that only a few of the books examined devoted a substantial amount of space to this topic. It also found a wider range of thesis types than the guides and handbooks would suggest occurs. The study identified four main kinds of thesis: \u2018traditional: simple\u2019, \u2018traditional: complex\u2019, \u2018topic-based\u2019 and \u2018compilations of research articles\u2019. The article argues for teaching materials which show students the range of thesis options they might have, highlight the kind of variation that occurs in actual texts, and consider the rationale for the various choices they might make.", "Learning English Through Workplace Communication: Linguistic devices for interpersonal meaning in textbooks in Hong Kong ": "Using language to establish and maintain interpersonal relationships contributes to effective workplace communication. Importantly, language plays a significant role in constructing professional role and identity, building solidarity and rapport, presenting comments and views, and facilitating collaboration and problem-solving in the workplace. Yet, the teaching of workplace interpersonal language is under-researched, and the extent to which such teaching materials, in particular textbooks, can assist ESP teachers in the classroom is unknown. In this article, we report on a study which evaluates textbooks designed for a module on learning workplace English in the senior secondary curriculum in Hong Kong. Specifically, it examines the textbooks, both qualitatively and quantitatively, regarding the presentation and teaching of linguistic devices of four broad areas of interpersonal meaning in different written and spoken workplace text-types and student activities. While linguistic devices in all the four broad areas of interpersonal meaning are identified, some areas, and most of the linguistic devices, are not given sufficient attention. The article therefore recommends that the textbooks should address the deficiencies identified and present interpersonal language in the workplace much more explicitly. It also highlights the need for ESP teachers to not exclusively rely on textbooks for teaching interpersonal language.", "Register analysis and ESP pedagogy: Noun-phrase modification in a corpus of English for military navy submariners ": "Research in Maritime English (ME) has paid no attention to the range of texts and language to which Navy submariners are exposed during their training and professional careers. This research looked at Noun Phrase (NP)modification patterns in a longitudinal corpus of Submarine English (SE) professional texts in the Cartagena Military Submarine Corpus (CMSC). Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses, we found that SE is characterised by heavy nominal premodification, low adjective premodification, low prepositional phrase postmodification and by the predominant use of appositive nouns in postmodifying slots. These distinctive features of SE call for a register-sensitive pedagogy that unpack these characteristics and present them in context. We argue that the contribution of corpus linguistics is essential to explore registers which, for different reasons, have not been addressed or described linguistically in the past. Similarly, we maintain that the examination and teaching of NPs is essential to understand current trends in professional writing and communication.", "Is academic writing becoming more informal? ": "Informality has become something of a contemporary mantra as, from the denim-clad offices of internet startups to the pages of business reports, we are encouraged to shed old constraints and relax conventions. This paper explores the perception that since informality has now invaded a large range of written and spoken domains of discourse, academic writing has also followed this trend. It asks the question whether academics are now freer to construct less rigidly objective texts and craft a more inclusive relationship with their readers. Taking a corpus of 2.2 million words from the same leading journals in four disciplines at three periods over the past years, we explore changes in the use of ten key features regarded by applied linguists and style guide authors as representing informality. Our results show only a small increase in the use of these features, and that this is mainly accounted for by increases in the hard sciences rather than the social sciences. It is also largely restricted to increases in first person pronouns, unattended reference and sentences beginning with conjunctions. We discuss these results and argue they represent changes in rhetorical conventions which accommodate more obvious interpersonal interactions in the sciences.", "Needs analysis for specialized learner populations: Essential methodological improvements ": "This study surveys the design, methods and procedures reported in needs analyses (NAs) conducted for specialized English learner populations in varying contexts over the last thirty years (1984\u20132014). While NA practice has evolved and undoubtedly improved over time, our survey identified several remaining shortcomings and a lack of consistency in the sources, the methods and the interactions between sources and methods that researchers use to gather data and interpret findings, problems which decrease their reliability and validity. To illustrate how methodological rigor in NA practice and reporting can be achieved, we detail the methods and procedure followed in a large-scale task-based NA conducted for non-native English speakers working at a national research institution in the USA. Based on the current NA and the findings of our methodological survey, we provide a set of practical recommendations that are intended to be adaptable for local contexts and useful to language program administrators, curriculum designers and teachers responsible for the design of ESP courses and programs.", "A prosodic profile of American Aviation English ": "Aviation English is a codified register of English used by international pilots and controllers, derived from postwar American radiotelephony. Although regulations require proficiency in Aviation English, little has been done to describe it. The current study seeks to add to the literature by describing the prosodic profile, or rhythm and intonation, of American Aviation English as compared to Standard American English. Specifically, we examine corpora of air traffic controller speech and professional radio broadcasters\u2019 speech: two corpora of naturally produced speech. This study demonstrates that Aviation English has a more restricted pitch range, is faster, and exhibits less variable vowel durations and more variable consonant durations than Standard English. These prosodic differences from Standard English may create difficulties for Aviation English users, and indicate inaccuracy in the assumption that attaining proficiency in conversational English is sufficient for proficiency in Aviation English.", "Quantifying the impact of language on the performance of international accounting students: A cognitive load theory perspective ": "This study offers timely empirical evidence of the magnitude of the language effect on the performance of different language user groups, namely English as a Foreign Language (EFL), English as a Second Language (ESL), and English as a Native Language (ENL) in an accounting program instructed in English, an area that has been under researched. Informed by Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), this study develops an innovative research methodology (crossover repeated measures design), drawing on a large data analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a02912) of students' academic results in six accounting specialisation subjects between 2007 and 2014 in an Australian university's undergraduate accounting program. Results show that while all language user groups perform worse in more conceptually (MC) oriented subjects compared to less conceptually (LC) oriented subjects, the relative performance between MC and LC is strongly related to English language user groups. For the first time the magnitude of the impact is derived. The study has implications for the instructional design of accounting programs in English-speaking universities and their offshore programs in non-English speaking countries.", "A corpus-based analysis of grammatical complexity as a measure of international teaching assistants\u2019 oral English proficiency ": "Oral English proficiency is one among several crucial factors to help determine the eligibility of international teaching assistants (ITAs) for various tasks associated with teaching undergraduate students at U.S. universities. The oral English proficiency test (OEPT) is a test used to screen prospective ITAs whose TOEFL speaking scores were below the cutoff required for admission and to determine whether they need additional support courses. Drawing on previous studies conducted in the context of oral assessment and university settings, ten grammatical features were selected to investigate grammatical complexity in the responses of the OEPT test takers. Our study explores which grammatical features are more frequently used by the test takers who passed and failed the test. The results show that the OEPT tasks elicited grammatical features commonly found in academic university registers (e.g., classroom teaching). Highly proficient test takers also used grammatical features commonly found in written texts and more extended spoken discourse (e.g., relative clauses) more frequently than lower proficiency ones. We hope that the findings of this study will inform the ongoing rating scale validation for ITA contexts by providing test developers and raters with specific evidence of grammatical features used by test takers at particular scores.", "A three-dimensional model of personal self-mention in research papers ": "Self-mention in academic writing has been studied extensively, especially from the point of view of rhetorical functions. In this paper I argue that rhetorical functions represent only one dimension of self-mention. Adding the dimensions of grammatical forms and of hedging and boosting, I propose a three-dimensional model of self-mention. I then employ the model in the analysis of three types of writing in the field of linguistics \u2013 L1 English, L1 Slovak (a typologically different language), and L2 English writing by Slovak authors. The study shows that authors employ various degrees of the three dimensions of self-mention to meet expectations of their readers while maintaining a balanced power of self-mention. The results suggest that some, but not all, discourse practices related to self-mention might be transferred to L2 English from one's L1.", "Strengthening move analysis methodology towards bridging the function-form gap ": "Move analysis is a text analytical approach first developed by John Swales (1981) to investigate the underlying generic structure of research articles (RAs) in terms of moves-and-steps for pedagogical purposes. A widely shared aspiration of move analysts has been to identify the linguistic features characterizing the various RA moves not only in English, but also across languages. One shortcoming blocking this advancement is the lack of multilingual corpora fully annotated for their specific communicative functions in a coordinated and reliable manner. In this paper, we describe and discuss a methodology for analysing the various RA sections for their generic structure up from the step level in two languages and across a wide range of disciplines, using the discussion section as a test case for illustrating that methodology. Among the topics treated are establishing criteria for choosing a suitable sample of comparable RA discussions across the two languages, designing a model for annotating the section's moves and steps, creating an accessible computer-assisted coding scheme, achieving good levels of inter-rater reliability, and obtaining validation from expert informants and writers. In essence, this is a methodology paper offered as a working model for other EAP researchers undertaking similar analyses in future.", "Profiling maritime communication by non-native speakers: A quantitative comparison between the baseline and standard marine communication phraseology ": "This paper compares ESP communication by non-native speakers of Maritime English with communication outside a nautical setting in order to profile its structural idiosyncrasy. Vocabulary growth, word frequencies, lexical and key word densities, and grammar diversity as dependent linguistic variables observed in transcribed full-mission simulation exercises are contrasted to the Brown Corpus, the Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English and the Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP). Using quantitative linguistics, inherent structural patterns of nautical team communication are identified and similarities and variations highlighted. Significant differences found in all linguistic features are gauged by means of the Probability of Superiority (PS) effect size. A linguistic profile is created which quantifies the observed language patterns and provides a quantitative model for the linguistic genre of this particular discourse community. The model fills the gap of quantitative research on empirical bridge team communication samples and delivers a valid tool for estimating the magnitude of observed linguistic effects.", "\u201cIn this paper we suggest\u201d: Changing patterns of disciplinary metadiscourse ": "Metadiscourse is the commentary on a text made by its producer in the course of speaking or writing. Here we take an interpersonal perspective, focusing on metadiscourse as a repertoire of resources available for writers to organise a discourse or their stance towards its content or the reader. In this paper we explore whether, and to what extent, metadiscourse has changed in professional writing in different disciplines over the past 50 years. Extending our diachronic work analysing a corpus of 2.2 million words from articles in the top journals in four disciplines, we show there has been a significant increase in interactive features and a significant decrease in interactional types. Surprisingly, interactional metadiscourse shows a marked decline in the discursive soft knowledge fields and a substantial increase in the science subjects.", "The benefits of explicit teaching of language for curriculum learning in the physical education classroom ": "Among the many subjects taught at primary, secondary and tertiary institutions physical education (PE) has had limited discussion with respect to the language of PE. As an examination subject in secondary school, physical performance is one key factor leading to success in PE; however, PE disciplinary knowledge is often assessed through written or spoken texts, resulting in students needing to have both the ability to physically perform and the disciplinary literacy required to demonstrate knowledge of the subject. The present paper extends the discussion of content and language integrated learning (CLIL), by providing a theory of language and a pedagogy informed by systemic functional linguistics; and investigating the benefits of the explicit teaching of curriculum language related to PE in order to prepare students to succeed in PE exams. Data including observations and videos of classroom interaction, texts written by students and interviews with teachers and students were collected at Hamstead Hall Academy, Birmingham, UK, where over 50% of students have English as an additional language. The data were analysed to investigate if the explicit teaching of the language of PE had a positive impact on both teachers and students. In focussing specifically on the language of PE, the teachers became more aware of the role of language as meaning making resource, students' written assignments improved and overall the PE exam results increased dramatically. These findings illustrate the benefit of explicitly teaching discipline specific language for curriculum learning, and highlight the language of PE, which tends to be a marginalised subject in the discussion of ESP.", "Lexical bundles in stand-alone literature reviews: Sections, frequencies, and functions ": "Stand-alone literature reviews exist to synthesize the vast amount of data produced by modern academia, but to date, little research exists on this genre of written academic prose. The present study, therefore, investigates the frequency, dispersion, and discourse functions of lexical bundles in stand-alone literature reviews. A 3.4 million word corpus of 417 stand-alone literature reviews in psychology, education, and medicine was compiled, and four-word bundles occurring more than 40 times per million words were extracted. Part of the corpus was then divided into IMRD sections, (i.e., introduction, methods, results, and discussion), and the frequency, dispersion, and function of these lexical bundles were examined within each section. Results revealed that lexical bundles in stand-alone literature reviews were identical to those found in other studies of academic writing, which suggests that a core set of bundles for written academic prose may exist. However, the frequency of each bundle differed by section, and concordance lines presented a range of discourse functions. Bundles established research gaps, clarified results and methods, reported data, undergirded interpretations, and contextualized findings. Further research into lexical bundle frequency and use patterns within sections of stand-alone literature reviews is needed to establish pedagogical guidelines for lexical bundle use.", "Meeting the challenges of English-medium higher education: The first-year experience in Hong Kong ": "This article examines the language-related challenges that first-year students face when adjusting to the demands of English-medium higher education in Hong Kong. The article is based on the findings of a longitudinal study which tracked the university careers of 28 students from a range of backgrounds via in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted at regular intervals over their three years of study. These findings are complemented by the results of a questionnaire survey completed by around 3 000 students at the same university. The interview and survey findings indicate that students experience four particular problems during the crucial first year at university: understanding technical vocabulary, comprehending lectures, achieving an appropriate academic style and meeting institutional and disciplinary requirements. The evidence suggests that students are able to overcome these and other problems through a combination of strong motivation, hard work, effective learning strategies and supportive peer networks. To illustrate and personalise the first-year experience, the article paints \u2018portraits\u2019 of three students from different societal, educational and disciplinary backgrounds. These portraits follow a series of \u2018landscapes\u2019 which depict recurring patterns in the qualitative and quantitative data. The article concludes by discussing the implications of the study for EAP provision in ESL and EFL contexts.", "An innovative approach in the detection of Toxocara canis excretory/secretory antigens using specific nanobodies ": "Human toxocariasis is a zoonosis resulting from the migration of larval stages of the dog parasite Toxocara canis into the human paratenic host. Despite its well-known limitations, serology remains the most important tool to diagnose the disease. Our objective was to employ camelid single domain antibody fragments also known as nanobodies (Nbs) for a specific and sensitive detection of Toxocara canis excretory/secretory (TES) antigens. From an alpaca immune Nb library, we retrieved different Nbs with specificity for TES antigens. Based on ELISA experiments, these Nbs did not show any cross-reactivity with Ascaris lumbricoides, Ascaris suum, Pseudoterranova decipiens, Anisakis simplex and Angiostrongylus cantonensis larval antigens. Western blot and immunocapturing revealed that Nbs 1TCE39, 1TCE52 and 2TCE49 recognise shared epitopes on different components of TES antigen. The presence of disulphide bonds in the target antigen seems to be essential for recognition of the epitopes by these three Nbs. Three separate sandwich ELISA formats, using monovalent and bivalent Nbs, were assessed to maximise the detection of TES antigens in solution. The combination of biotinylated, bivalent Nb 2TCE49 on a streptavidin pre-coated plate to capture TES antigens, and Nb 1TCE39 chemically coupled to horseradish peroxidase for detection of the captured TES antigens, yielded the most sensitive ELISA with a limit of detection of 0.650\u202fng/ml of TES antigen, spiked in serum. Moreover, the assay was able to detect TES antigens in sera from mice, taken 3\u202fdays after the animals were experimentally infected with T. canis. The specific characteristics of Nbs make this ELISA not only a promising tool for the detection of TES antigens in clinical samples, but also for a detailed structural and functional study of TES antigens.", "Out of Africa: origins and evolution of the human malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax\n             ": "Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax account for more than 95% of all human malaria infections, and thus pose a serious public health challenge. To control and potentially eliminate these pathogens, it is important to understand their origins and evolutionary history. Until recently, it was widely believed that P. falciparum had co-evolved with humans (and our ancestors) over millions of years, whilst P. vivax was assumed to have emerged in southeastern Asia following the cross-species transmission of a parasite from a macaque. However, the discovery of a multitude of Plasmodium spp. in chimpanzees and gorillas has refuted these theories and instead revealed that both P. falciparum and P. vivax evolved from parasites infecting wild-living African apes. It is now clear that P. falciparum resulted from a recent cross-species transmission of a parasite from a gorilla, whilst P. vivax emerged from an ancestral stock of parasites that infected chimpanzees, gorillas and humans in Africa, until the spread of the protective Duffy-negative mutation eliminated P. vivax from human populations there. Although many questions remain concerning the biology and zoonotic potential of the P. falciparum- and P. vivax-like parasites infecting apes, comparative genomics, coupled with functional parasite and vector studies, are likely to yield new insights into ape Plasmodium transmission and pathogenesis that are relevant to the treatment and prevention of human malaria.", "Generation and functional characterisation of Plasmodium yoelii csp deletion mutants using a microhomology-based CRISPR/Cas9 method ": "CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful genome editing method that has greatly facilitated functional studies in many eukaryotic organisms including malaria parasites. Due to the lack of genes encoding enzymes necessary for the non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway, genetic manipulation of malaria parasite genomes is generally accomplished through homologous recombination requiring the presence of DNA templates. Recently, an alternative double-strand break repair pathway, microhomology-mediated end joining, was found in the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. Taking advantage of the MMEJ pathway, we developed a MMEJ-based CRISPR/Cas9 (mCRISPR) strategy to efficiently generate multiple mutant parasites simultaneously in genes with repetitive sequences. As a proof of principle, we successfully produced various size mutants in the central repeat region of the Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite surface protein without the use of template DNA. Monitoring mixed parasite populations and individual parasites with different sizes of CSP-CRR showed that the CSP-CRR plays a role in the development of mosquito stages, with severe developmental defects in parasites with large deletions in the repeat region. However, the majority of the csp mutant parasite clones grew similarly to the wild type P. yoelii 17XL parasite in mice. This study develops a useful technique to efficiently generate mutant parasites with deletions or insertions, and shows that the CSP-CRR plays a role in parasite development in mosquito.", "Trypanosomatid parasites infecting managed honeybees and wild solitary bees ": "The parasite Crithidia mellificae (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae) infects honeybees, Apis mellifera. No pathogenic effects have been found in individual hosts, despite positive correlations between infections and colony mortalities. The solitary bee Osmia cornuta might constitute a host, but controlled infections are lacking to date. Here, we challenged male and female O. cornuta and honeybee workers in laboratory cages with C. mellificae. No parasite cells were found in any control. Parasite numbers increased 6.6 fold in honeybees between days 6 and 19 p.i. and significantly reduced survival. In O. cornuta, C. mellificae numbers increased 2\u20133.6 fold within cages and significantly reduced survival of males, but not females. The proportion of infected hosts increased in O. cornuta cages with faeces, but not in honeybee cages without faeces, suggesting faecal \u2013 oral transmission. The data show that O. cornuta is a host of C. mellificae and suggest that males are more susceptible. The higher mortality of infected honeybees proposes a mechanism for correlations between C. mellificae infections and colony mortalities.", "\n               Haemonchus contortus: the then and now, and where to from here? ": "Haemonchus contortus (Barber\u2019s pole worm or \u201cBPW\u201d) is the nematode \u201cnemesis\u201d of small ruminant production systems in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Its reputation derives from a combination of high fecundity and a short generational interval that provides an enviable developmental plasticity for adaptation or resistance to control measures. This review critically examines the historical and current literature on the host\u2013parasite\u2013environment interaction for H. contortus, particularly in sheep, to highlight changes in parasite distribution and ecology on pasture, changes to the seasonal inhibition of fourth stage larvae and the most appropriate models to identify protective responses and assess vaccines. The review also proposes pathways to bring host genetics to fruition and avenues where advances in the parasite genome may complement control measures.", "Evolutionary sex allocation theory explains sex ratios in natural Plasmodium falciparum infections ": "Malaria transmission is achieved by sexual stages, called gametocytes, and the proportion of gametocytes that are male versus female (sex ratio) influences transmission success. In malaria model systems, variation in gametocyte sex ratios can be explained by the predictions of evolutionary sex allocation theory. We test these predictions using natural Plasmodium falciparum infections. The predicted negative correlation between sex ratio and gametocyte density holds: the sex ratio increases when gametocyte densities decrease, and this is most apparent in single genotype infections and in the dry season. We do not observe higher gametocyte sex ratios in mixed compared with single genotype infections.", "Rhoptry neck protein 11 has crucial roles during malaria parasite sporozoite invasion of salivary glands and hepatocytes ": "The malaria parasite sporozoite sequentially invades mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes; and is the Plasmodium lifecycle infective form mediating parasite transmission by the mosquito vector. The identification of several sporozoite-specific secretory proteins involved in invasion has revealed that sporozoite motility and specific recognition of target cells are crucial for transmission. It has also been demonstrated that some components of the invasion machinery are conserved between erythrocytic asexual and transmission stage parasites. The application of a sporozoite stage-specific gene knockdown system in the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, enables us to investigate the roles of such proteins previously intractable to study due to their essentiality for asexual intraerythrocytic stage development, the stage at which transgenic parasites are derived. Here, we focused on the rhoptry neck protein 11 (RON11) that contains multiple transmembrane domains and putative calcium-binding EF-hand domains. PbRON11 is localised to rhoptry organelles in both merozoites and sporozoites. To repress PbRON11 expression exclusively in sporozoites, we produced transgenic parasites using a promoter-swapping strategy. PbRON11-repressed sporozoites showed significant reduction in attachment and motility in vitro, and consequently failed to efficiently invade salivary glands. PbRON11 was also determined to be essential for sporozoite infection of the liver, the first step during transmission to the vertebrate host. RON11 is demonstrated to be crucial for sporozoite invasion of both target host cells \u2013 mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes \u2013 via involvement in sporozoite motility.", "\n               Schistosoma mansoni venom allergen-like proteins: phylogenetic relationships, stage-specific transcription and tissue localization as predictors of immunological cross-reactivity ": "Schistosoma mansoni venom allergen-like proteins (SmVALs) are part of a diverse protein superfamily partitioned into two groups (group 1 and group 2). Phylogenetic analyses of group 1 SmVALs revealed that members could be segregated into subclades (A\u2013D); these subclades share similar gene expression patterns across the parasite lifecycle and immunological cross-reactivity. Furthermore, whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that the phylogenetically, transcriptionally and immunologically-related SmVAL4, 10, 18 and 19 (subclade C) were all localized to the pre-acetabular glands of immature cercariae. Our results suggest that SmVAL group 1 phylogenetic relationships, stage-specific transcriptional profiles and tissue localization are predictive of immunological cross-reactivity.", "Reappraisal of Hydatigera taeniaeformis (Batsch, 1786) (Cestoda: Taeniidae) sensu lato with description of Hydatigera kamiyai n. sp. ": "The common cat tapeworm Hydatigera taeniaeformis is a complex of three morphologically cryptic entities, which can be differentiated genetically. To clarify the biogeography and the host spectrum of the cryptic lineages, 150 specimens of H. taeniaeformis in various definitive and intermediate hosts from Eurasia, Africa and Australia were identified with DNA barcoding using partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene sequences and compared with previously published data. Additional phylogenetic analyses of selected isolates were performed using nuclear DNA and mitochondrial genome sequences. Based on molecular data and morphological analysis, Hydatigera kamiyai n. sp. Iwaki is proposed for a cryptic lineage, which is predominantly northern Eurasian and uses mainly arvicoline rodents (voles) and mice of the genus Apodemus as intermediate hosts. Hydatigera taeniaeformis sensu stricto (s.s.) is restricted to murine rodents (rats and mice) as intermediate hosts. It probably originates from Asia but has spread worldwide. Despite remarkable genetic divergence between H. taeniaeformis s.s. and H. kamiyai, interspecific morphological differences are evident only in dimensions of rostellar hooks. The third cryptic lineage is closely related to H. kamiyai, but its taxonomic status remains unresolved due to limited morphological, molecular, biogeographical and ecological data. This Hydatigera sp. is confined to the Mediterranean and its intermediate hosts are unknown. Further studies are needed to classify Hydatigera sp. either as a distinct species or a variant of H. kamiyai. According to previously published limited data, all three entities occur in the Americas, probably due to human-mediated introductions.", "\n               Giardia: an under-reported foodborne parasite ": "Foodborne zoonotic pathogens are a serious public health issue and result in significant global economic losses. Despite their importance to public health, epidemiological data on foodborne diseases including giardiasis caused by the enteric parasite, Giardia duodenalis, are lacking. This parasite is estimated to cause \u223c28.2 million cases of diarrhoea each year due to contamination of food, but very few foodborne outbreaks have been documented due to the limitations of current detection as well as surveillance methods. The current method for the recovery of Giardia cysts from food matrices using immunomagnetic separation requires further standardisation and cost reduction before it can be widely used. It also should incorporate downstream molecular procedures for genotyping, and traceback and viability analyses. Foodborne giardiasis can be potentially controlled through improvements in national disease surveillance systems and the establishment of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point interventions across the food chain. Studies are needed to assess the true prevalence and public health impact of foodborne giardiasis.", "Metagenomics for broad and improved parasite detection: a proof-of-concept study using swine faecal samples ": "Efficient and reliable identification of emerging pathogens is crucial for the design and implementation of timely and proportionate control strategies. This is difficult if the pathogen is so far unknown or only distantly related with known pathogens. Diagnostic metagenomics \u2013 an undirected, broad and sensitive method for the efficient identification of pathogens \u2013 was frequently used for virus and bacteria detection, but seldom applied to parasite identification. Here, metagenomics datasets prepared from swine faeces using an unbiased sample processing approach with RNA serving as starting material were re-analysed with respect to parasite detection. The taxonomic identification tool RIEMS, used for initial detection, provided basic hints on potential pathogens contained in the datasets. The suspected parasites/intestinal protists (Blastocystis, Entamoeba, Iodamoeba, Neobalantidium, Tetratrichomonas) were verified using subsequently applied reference mapping analyses on the base of rRNA sequences. Nearly full-length gene sequences could be extracted from the RNA-derived datasets. In the case of Blastocystis, subtyping was possible with subtype (ST)15 discovered for the first known time in swine faeces. Using RIEMS, some of the suspected candidates turned out to be false-positives caused by the poor status of sequences in publicly available databases. Altogether, 11 different species/STs of parasites/intestinal protists were detected in 34 out of 41 datasets extracted from metagenomics data. The approach operates without any primer bias that typically hampers the analysis of amplicon-based approaches, and allows the detection and taxonomic classification including subtyping of protist and metazoan endobionts (parasites, commensals or mutualists) based on an abundant biomarker, the 18S rRNA. The generic nature of the approach also allows evaluation of interdependencies that induce mutualistic or pathogenic effects that are often not clear for many intestinal protists and perhaps other parasites. Thus, metagenomics has the potential for generic pathogen identification beyond the characterisation of viruses and bacteria when starting from RNA instead of DNA.", "Removal of adult cyathostomins alters faecal microbiota and promotes an inflammatory phenotype in horses ": "The interactions between parasitic helminths and gut microbiota are considered to be an important, although as yet incompletely understood, factor in the regulation of immunity, inflammation and a range of diseases. Infection with intestinal helminths is ubiquitous in grazing horses, with cyathostomins (about 50 species of which are recorded) predominating. Consequences of infection include both chronic effects, and an acute inflammatory syndrome, acute larval cyathostominosis, which sometimes follows removal of adult helminths by administration of anthelmintic drugs. The presence of cyathostomins as a resident helminth population of the equine gut (the \u201chelminthome\u201d) provides an opportunity to investigate the effect helminth infection, and its perturbation, has on both the immune system and bacterial microbiome of the gut, as well as to determine the specific mechanisms of pathophysiology involved in equine acute larval cyathostominosis. We studied changes in the faecal microbiota of two groups of horses following treatment with anthelmintics (fenbendazole or moxidectin). We found decreases in both alpha diversity and beta diversity of the faecal microbiota at Day 7 post-treatment, which were reversed by Day 14. These changes were accompanied by increases in inflammatory biomarkers. The general pattern of faecal microbiota detected was similar to that seen in the relatively few equine gut microbiome studies reported to date. We conclude that interplay between resident cyathostomin populations and the bacterial microbiota of the equine large intestine is important in maintaining homeostasis and that disturbance of this ecology can lead to gut dysbiosis and play a role in the aetiology of inflammatory conditions in the horse, including acute larval cyathostominosis.", "Lungworms and gastrointestinal parasites of domestic cats: a European perspective ": "With the exception of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, feline lungworms have been poorly studied. Information on their distribution is patchy and mostly limited to case reports. In this study, the occurrence of feline lungworms and co-infecting gastrointestinal parasites has been investigated in 12 European countries (i.e. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). An average of 10 domestic cats, with regular outdoor access, was sampled each month for 12months, and freshly passed faeces were collected. Stools were processed using a McMaster assay and a quantitative Baermann-Wetzel method. Animals positive for lungworms and/or gastrointestinal parasites were treated with a formulation containing fipronil, (S)-methoprene, eprinomectin, and praziquantel (Broadline\u00ae, Merial), and re-sampled 28days post-treatment. The association between lungworm infection and risk factors was analysed using statistical medians/means and the efficacy of the treatment against each lungworm species was assessed. Of 1990 cats sampled, 613 (30.8%) were positive for at least one parasite, while 210 (10.6%) were infected by lungworms. The prevalence of lungworm infection varied between the sampled sites, with the highest recorded in Bulgaria (35.8%) and the lowest in Switzerland (0.8%). None of the cats from Austria or the United Kingdom were infected by lungworms. Aelurostrongylus abstrusus was the species most frequently detected (78.1%), followed by Troglostrongylus brevior (19.5%), Eucoleus aerophilus (14.8%) and Oslerus rostratus (3.8%). The overall efficacy of the treatment was 99% for A. abstrusus and 100% for T. brevior, O. rostratus and E. aerophilus. Data presented provide a comprehensive account of the diagnosis, epidemiology and treatment of feline lungworms in Europe, as well as of the occurrence of co-infections by gastrointestinal parasites.", "Innate immune responses play a key role in controlling infection of the intestinal epithelium by Cryptosporidium\n             ": "Cryptosporidium infection leads to acute diarrhea worldwide. The development of cryptosporidiosis is closely related to the immune status of its host, affecting primarily young ruminants, infants, and immunocompromised individuals. In recent years, several studies have improved our knowledge on the immune mechanisms responsible for the control of the acute phase of the infection and have highlighted the importance of innate immunity. The parasite develops in the apical side of intestinal epithelial cells, giving these cells a central role, as they are both the exclusive host cell for replication of the parasite and participate in the protective immune response. Epithelial cells signal the infection by producing chemokines, attracting immune cells to the infected area. They also actively participate in host defense by inducing apoptosis and releasing antimicrobial peptides, free or incorporated into luminal exosomes, with parasiticidal activity. The parasite has developed several escape mechanisms to slow down these protective mechanisms. Recent development of several three-dimensional culture models and the ability to genetically manipulate Cryptosporidium will greatly help to further investigate host-pathogen interactions and identify virulence factors. Intestinal epithelial cells require the help of immune cells to clear the infection. Intestinal dendritic cells, well known for their ability to induce and orchestrate adaptive immunity, play a key role in controlling the very early steps of Cryptosporidium parvum infection by acting as immunological sentinels and active effectors. However, inflammatory monocytes, which are quickly and massively recruited to the infected mucosa, seem to participate in the loss of epithelial integrity. In addition to new promising chemotherapies, we must consider stimulating the innate immunity of neonates to strengthen their ability to control Cryptosporidium development. The microbiota plays a fundamental role in the development of intestinal immunity and may be considered to be a third actor in host-pathogen interactions. There is an urgent need to reduce the incidence of this yet poorly controlled disease in the populations of developing countries, and decrease economic losses due to infected livestock.", "Deep amplicon sequencing as a powerful new tool to screen for sequence polymorphisms associated with anthelmintic resistance in parasitic nematode populations ": "Parasitic gastrointestinal nematodes contribute to significant human morbidity and cause billions of dollars per year in lost agricultural production. Control is dependent on the use of anthelmintic drugs which, in the case of livestock parasites, is severely compromised by the widespread development of drug resistance. There are now concerns regarding the emergence of anthelmintic resistance in parasitic nematodes of humans in response to the selection pressure resulting from mass drug administration programs. Consequently, there is an urgent need for sensitive, scalable and accurate diagnostic tools to detect the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. Detecting and measuring the frequency of resistance-associated mutations in parasite populations has the potential to provide sensitive and quantitative assessment of resistance emergence from an early stage. Here, we describe the development and validation of deep amplicon sequencing as a powerful new approach to detect and quantify the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with benzimidazole resistance. We have used parasite communities in sheep to undertake a proof-of-concept study of this approach. Sheep provide an excellent host system, as there are multiple co-infecting trichostrongylid nematode species, each likely with a varying prevalence of benzimidazole resistance. We demonstrate that the approach provides an accurate measure of resistance allele frequencies, and can reliably detect resistance alleles down to a frequency of 0.1%, making it particularly valuable for screening mutations in the early stages of resistance. We illustrate the power of the technique by screening UK sheep flocks for benzimidazole resistance-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms at three different codons of the \u03b2-tubulin gene in seven different parasite species from 164 populations (95 from ewes and 69 from lambs) in a single MiSeq sequencing run. This approach provides a powerful new tool to screen for the emergence of anthelmintic resistance mutations in parasitic nematode populations of both animals and humans.", "Out-of-Africa, human-mediated dispersal of the common cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis: The hitchhiker\u2019s guide to world domination ": "The cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) is the most common parasite of domestic cats and dogs worldwide. Due to the morphological ambiguity of C. felis and a lack of \u2014 particularly largescale \u2014 phylogenetic data, we do not know whether global C. felis populations are morphologically and genetically conserved, or whether human-mediated migration of domestic cats and dogs has resulted in homogenous global populations. To determine the ancestral origin of the species and to understand the level of global pervasion of the cat flea and related taxa, our study aimed to document the distribution and phylogenetic relationships of Ctenocephalides fleas found on cats and dogs worldwide. We investigated the potential drivers behind the establishment of regional cat flea populations using a global collection of fleas from cats and dogs across six continents. We morphologically and molecularly evaluated six out of the 14 known taxa comprising genus Ctenocephalides, including the four original C. felis subspecies (Ctenocephalides felis felis, Ctenocephalides felis strongylus, Ctenocephalides felis orientis and Ctenocephalides felis damarensis), the cosmopolitan species Ctenocephalides canis and the African species Ctenocephalides connatus. We confirm the ubiquity of the cat flea, representing 85% of all fleas collected (4357/5123). Using a multigene approach combining two mitochondrial (cox1 and cox2) and two nuclear (Histone H3 and EF-1\u03b1) gene markers, as well as a cox1 survey of 516 fleas across 56 countries, we demonstrate out-of-Africa origins for the genus Ctenocephalides and high levels of genetic diversity within C. felis. We define four bioclimatically limited C. felis clusters (Temperate, Tropical I, Tropical II and African) using maximum entropy modelling. This study defines the global distribution, African origin and phylogenetic relationships of global Ctenocephalides fleas, whilst resolving the taxonomy of the C. felis subspecies and related taxa. We show that humans have inadvertently precipitated the expansion of C. felis throughout the world, promoting diverse population structure and bioclimatic plasticity. By demonstrating the link between the global cat flea communities and their affinity for specific bioclimatic niches, we reveal the drivers behind the establishment and success of the cat flea as a global parasite.", "Advances in the application of genetic manipulation methods to apicomplexan parasites ": "Apicomplexan parasites such as Babesia, Theileria, Eimeria, Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma greatly impact animal health globally, and improved, cost-effective measures to control them are urgently required. These parasites have complex multi-stage life cycles including obligate intracellular stages. Major gaps in our understanding of the biology of these relatively poorly characterised parasites and the diseases they cause severely limit options for designing novel control methods. Here we review potentially important shared aspects of the biology of these parasites, such as cell invasion, host cell modification, and asexual and sexual reproduction, and explore the potential of the application of relatively well-established or newly emerging genetic manipulation methods, such as classical transfection or gene editing, respectively, for closing important gaps in our knowledge of the function of specific genes and proteins, and the biology of these parasites. In addition, genetic manipulation methods impact the development of novel methods of control of the diseases caused by these economically important parasites. Transient and stable transfection methods, in conjunction with whole and deep genome sequencing, were initially instrumental in improving our understanding of the molecular biology of apicomplexan parasites and paved the way for the application of the more recently developed gene editing methods. The increasingly efficient and more recently developed gene editing methods, in particular those based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system and previous conceptually similar techniques, are already contributing to additional gene function discovery using reverse genetics and related approaches. However, gene editing methods are only possible due to the increasing availability of in vitro culture, transfection, and genome sequencing and analysis techniques. We envisage that rapid progress in the development of novel gene editing techniques applied to apicomplexan parasites of veterinary interest will ultimately lead to the development of novel and more efficient methods for disease control.", "Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS): from case reports to a call for concerted action against this neglected gynaecological disease ": "In recent years, control of neglected tropical diseases has been increasingly gaining momentum and interventions against schistosomiasis are being progressively scaled-up through expansion of donated praziquantel and preventive chemotherapy campaigns. However, the public health importance of female genital schistosomiasis is not fully recognised nor its control is adequately addressed. Taking a clinical and anatomopathological perspective, we evaluated the available literature to highlight the importance of female genital schistosomiasis and its connections with two sexually transmitted infections of global importance, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Human Papilloma Virus. Outside the long list of clinical descriptive reports beginning in 1899, there is presently a shocking gap in epidemiological assessment and a significant underestimation of the burden of FGS remains. The scarcity of integrated approaches to address female genital schistosomiasis calls for more concerted action in its detection, treatment and prevention alongside other concomitant women\u2019s health issues, otherwise female genital schistosomiasis will remain a neglected gynaecological disease.", "\n               Giardia duodenalis induces pathogenic dysbiosis of human intestinal microbiota biofilms ": "Giardia duodenalis is a prevalent cause of acute diarrheal disease worldwide. However, recent outbreaks in Italy and Norway have revealed a link between giardiasis and the subsequent development of chronic post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. While the mechanisms underlying the causation of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome remain obscure, recent findings suggest that alterations in gut microbiota communities are linked to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome. In the present study, we use a laboratory biofilm system to culture and enrich mucosal microbiota from human intestinal biopsies. Subsequently, we show that co-culture with Giardia induces disturbances in biofilm species composition and biofilm structure resulting in microbiota communities that are intrinsically dysbiotic \u2013 even after the clearance of Giardia. These microbiota abnormalities were mediated in part by secretory-excretory Giardia cysteine proteases. Using in vitro cell culture and germ-free murine infection models, we show that Giardia-induced disruptions of microbiota promote bacterial invasion, resulting in epithelial apoptosis, tight junctional disruption, and bacterial translocation across an intestinal epithelial barrier. Additionally, these dysbiotic microbiota communities resulted in increased activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 signalling pathway, and overproduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in humanized germ-free mice. Previous studies that have sought explanations and risk factors for the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome have focused on features of enteropathogens and attributes of the infected host. We propose that polymicrobial interactions involving Giardia and gut microbiota may cause persistent dysbiosis, offering a new interpretation of the reasons why those afflicted with giardiasis are predisposed to gastrointestinal disorders post-infection.", "New approaches to studying Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion and insights into invasion biology ": "Merozoite invasion of human red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum is essential for blood stage asexual replication and the development of malaria disease. Despite this, many of the processes involved in invasion are poorly understood. Recent advances have been made in methods to isolate viable merozoites for studies of invasion. The application of these approaches is providing new insights into the kinetics of invasion and merozoite survival, as well as proteins and interactions involved in invasion, and will facilitate the development and testing of anti-merozoite vaccines and the identification of invasion-inhibitory compounds with potential for drug development. This review discusses these recent advances and considers potential avenues for future research.", "\n               Toxoplasma gondii: from animals to humans ": "Toxoplasmosis is one of the more common parasitic zoonoses world-wide. Its causative agent, Toxoplasma gondii, is a facultatively heteroxenous, polyxenous protozoon that has developed several potential routes of transmission within and between different host species. If first contracted during pregnancy, T. gondii may be transmitted vertically by tachyzoites that are passed to the foetus via the placenta. Horizontal transmission of T. gondii may involve three life-cycle stages, i.e. ingesting infectious oocysts from the environment or ingesting tissue cysts or tachyzoites which are contained in meat or primary offal (viscera) of many different animals. Transmission may also occur via tachyzoites contained in blood products, tissue transplants, or unpasteurised milk. However, it is not known which of these routes is more important epidemiologically. In the past, the consumption of raw or undercooked meat, in particular of pigs and sheep, has been regarded as a major route of transmission to humans. However, recent studies showed that the prevalence of T. gondii in meat-producing animals decreased considerably over the past 20 years in areas with intensive farm management. For example, in several countries of the European Union prevalences of T. gondii in fattening pigs are now <1%. Considering these data it is unlikely that pork is still a major source of infection for humans in these countries. However, it is likely that the major routes of transmission are different in human populations with differences in culture and eating habits. In the Americas, recent outbreaks of acute toxoplasmosis in humans have been associated with oocyst contamination of the environment. Therefore, future epidemiological studies on T. gondii infections should consider the role of oocysts as potential sources of infection for humans, and methods to monitor these are currently being developed. This review presents recent epidemiological data on T. gondii, hypotheses on the major routes of transmission to humans in different populations, and preventive measures that may reduce the risk of contracting a primary infection during pregnancy.", "Transcriptome and histone epigenome of Plasmodium vivax salivary-gland sporozoites point to tight regulatory control and mechanisms for liver-stage differentiation in relapsing malaria ": "Plasmodium vivax is the key obstacle to malaria elimination in Asia and Latin America, largely attributed to its ability to form resilient hypnozoites (sleeper cells) in the host liver that escape treatment and cause relapsing infections. The decision to form hypnozoites is made early in the liver infection and may already be set in sporozoites prior to invasion. To better understand these early stages of infection, we undertook a comprehensive transcriptomic and histone epigenetic characterization of P. vivax sporozoites. Through comparisons with recently published proteomic data for the P. vivax sporozoite, our study found that although highly transcribed, transcripts associated with functions needed for early infection of the vertebrate host are not detectable as proteins and may be regulated through translational repression. We identified differential transcription between the sporozoite and published transcriptomes of asexual blood stages and mixed versus hypnozoite-enriched liver stages. These comparisons point to multiple layers of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational control that appear active in sporozoites and to a lesser extent hypnozoites, but are largely absent in replicating liver schizonts or mixed blood stages. We also characterised histone epigenetic modifications in the P. vivax sporozoite and explored their role in regulating transcription. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the sporozoite is a tightly programmed stage to infect the human host and identify mechanisms for hypnozoite formation that may be further explored in liver stage models.", "\n               Plasmodium vivax vaccine research \u2013 we\u2019ve only just begun ": "Plasmodium vivax parasites cause the majority of malaria cases outside Africa, and are increasingly being acknowledged as a cause of severe disease. The unique attributes of P. vivax biology, particularly the capacity of the dormant liver stage, the hypnozoite, to maintain blood-stage infections even in the absence of active transmission, make blood-stage vaccines particularly attractive for this species. However, P. vivax vaccine development remains resolutely in first gear, with only a single blood-stage candidate having been evaluated in any depth. Experience with Plasmodium falciparum suggests that a much broader search for new candidates and a deeper understanding of high priority targets will be required to make significant advances. This review discusses some of the particular challenges of P. vivax blood-stage vaccine development, highlighting both recent advances and key remaining barriers to overcome in order to move development forward.", "Sensitivity of diagnostic tests for human soil-transmitted helminth infections: a meta-analysis in the absence of a true gold standard ": "Reliable, sensitive and practical diagnostic tests are an essential tool in disease control programmes for mapping, impact evaluation and surveillance. To provide a robust global assessment of the relative performance of available diagnostic tools for the detection of soil-transmitted helminths, we conducted a meta-analysis comparing the sensitivities and the quantitative performance of the most commonly used copro-microscopic diagnostic methods for soil-transmitted helminths, namely Kato-Katz, direct microscopy, formol-ether concentration, McMaster, FLOTAC and Mini-FLOTAC. In the absence of a perfect reference standard, we employed a Bayesian latent class analysis to estimate the true, unobserved sensitivity of compared diagnostic tests for each of the soil-transmitted helminth species Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and the hookworms. To investigate the influence of varying transmission settings we subsequently stratified the analysis by intensity of infection. Overall, sensitivity estimates varied between the different methods, ranging from 42.8% for direct microscopy to 92.7% for FLOTAC. The widely used double slide Kato-Katz method had a sensitivity of 74\u201395% for the three soil-transmitted helminth species at high infection intensity, however sensitivity dropped to 53\u201380% in low intensity settings, being lowest for hookworm and A. lumbricoides. The highest sensitivity, overall and in both intensity groups, was observed for the FLOTAC method, whereas the sensitivity of the Mini-FLOTAC method was comparable with the Kato-Katz method. FLOTAC average egg count estimates were significantly lower compared with Kato-Katz, while the compared McMaster counts varied. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC methods had comparable sensitivities. We further show that test sensitivity of the Kato-Katz method is reduced in low transmission settings.", "The future of wooden multistory construction in the forest bioeconomy \u2013 A Delphi study from Finland and Sweden ": "The rise of wooden multistory construction (WMC) in the Nordic countries has turned out to be the most evident construction-related new business opportunity in the emerging bioeconomy. Based on earlier literature, the future growth prospects for the rise of WMC are rooted in the concerns regarding environmental issues, as witnessed in a plethora of studies focusing on carbon footprinting. But do new (performance-based) regulations \u2018favor\u2019 WMC or do they give a more \u2018just\u2019 comparison of alternative building concepts? Therefore, more information is needed on the role of growing environmental awareness and preferences for wood as a renewable and recyclable material in the markets. Our paper presents results from a two-round Delphi study focusing on the relative strength and perceived interplay between likelihood and the desirability of environmental concerns in driving WMC in Finland and Sweden. Using qualitative analysis of expert interviews in the first Delphi round, the issues related to sustainable development appear to have growing importance in the marketplace. However, the panelists perceive that the emphasis on sustainability is mainly driven by the changing regulation reflecting societal needs, and only few experts saw it as echoing directly from changing individual consumer needs. In the second Delphi round, implemented with an online survey, the likelihood and desirability of sustainability as a megatrend in housing was perceived to gain further impetus toward 2030, both in the form of consumer demand for sustainable living and wood construction as a modern way of living. However, future research is needed to get a better understanding on the strength and scope of these drivers.", "Is forest carbon sequestration at the expense of bioenergy and forest products cost-efficient in EU climate policy to 2050? ": "Forest management affects the quantity of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere through carbon sequestration in standing biomass, carbon storage in forest products and production of bioenergy. The main question studied in this paper is whether forest carbon sequestration is worth increasing at the expense of bioenergy and forest products to achieve the EU emissions reduction target for 2050 in a cost-efficient manner. A dynamic cost minimisation model is used to find the optimal combination of carbon abatement strategies to meet annual emissions targets between 2010 and 2050. The results indicate that forest carbon sequestration is a low-cost abatement method. With sequestration, the net present costs of meeting EU carbon targets can be reduced by 23%.", "Immediate and long-run impacts of a forest carbon policy\u2014A market-level assessment with heterogeneous forest owners ": "Sequestering carbon in forests and wood products is an inexpensive way to reduce the atmospheric carbon concentration. However, its full potential is not utilized in present climate policies. Optimizing sequestration, while continuing to harvest wood for materials and energy, could reduce the economic burden of mitigation efforts. Optimal sequestration can be incentivized by subsidizing carbon storage according to its social value. We analyze the dynamic market-level impacts of implementing a forest carbon policy by using the Finnish Forest and Energy Policy model (FinFEP). We find that sizeable and immediate increases in carbon sinks can be obtained, even with low carbon prices. High carbon payments strongly increase the carbon sink in the short run, but this impact diminishes over time. Low payments have a milder but longer-lasting impact. Forest owners\u2019 valuations of forest amenities also affect the magnitude and dynamics of harvest and carbon sequestration results. Thus, a realistic description of forest owner behavior is needed to assess the impacts of forest carbon policies. Moreover, we show that a market-level model is necessary for assessing the regional carbon sequestration impacts and costs. Relying on stand-level models with fixed timber prices may yield overly optimistic results.", "Participation and compensation claims in voluntary forest landscape conservation: The case of the Ruka-Kuusamo tourism area, Finland ": "The expansion of nature-based tourism on private land requires new mechanisms to coordinate tourism industry and commercial forestry interests. This attribute-based contingent valuation study elaborated the supply side of potential payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanism named Landscape and Recreational Values Trading (LRVT), proposed to enhance the provision of amenity values in privately owned forests located in tourism and recreation areas. Using a mail survey data set, we analyzed forest owners\u2019 willingness to participate in LRVT and the related compensation claims in the Ruka-Kuusamo area, Finland. We found that more restrictive rules regarding forest management practices decrease the probability of participating and increase forest owners\u2019 compensation claims in LRVT. Furthermore, forest owners seem to claim more compensation if, instead of private negotiations, competitive tendering is used to make contracts. Moreover, besides the protection of landscape values, biodiversity protection may be a motive for participation. This indicates that, in addition to improved landscape quality, respondents gain personal benefits from enhanced biodiversity in their own forests. The results can help in designing and implementing a future payment mechanism for the provision of forest landscape and recreational values in terms of how to proceed and whom marketing and recruiting efforts should target.", "Carbon offsets out of the woods? Acceptability of domestic vs. international reforestation programmes in the lab ": "Following the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in November 2016, governments around the world are now expected to turn their nationally determined contributions into concrete climate policies. Given the global public good nature of climate change mitigation and the important cross-country differences in marginal abatement costs, distributing mitigation efforts across countries could substantially lower the overall cost of implementing climate policy. However, abating emissions abroad instead of domestically may face important political and popular resistance. We ran a lab experiment with more than 300 participants and asked them to choose between a domestic and an international reforestation project. We tested the effect of three informational treatments on the allocation of participants\u2019 endowment between the domestic and the international project. The treatments consisted in: (1) making more salient the cost-effectiveness gains associated with offsetting carbon abroad; (2) providing guarantees on the reliability of reforestation programmes; (3) stressing local ancillary benefits associated with domestic offset projects. We found that stressing the cost-effectiveness of the reforestation programme abroad did increase its support, the economic argument in favour of offsetting abroad being otherwise overlooked by participants. We relate this finding to the recent literature on the drivers of public support for climate policies, generally pointing to a gap between people's preferences and economists\u2019 prescriptions.", "The economic viability of smallholder timber production under expanding a\u00e7a\u00ed palm production in the Amazon Estuary ": "Relatively little attention has been paid to the economic potentials and limitations of tropical timber production and management at smallholder scales, with the most relevant research focusing on community forestry efforts. As a rare tropical example of long-lasting small-scale timber production, in this study we explore the economics of smallholder vertically integrated timber use to better understand the activity in the context of its primary land use alternative in the Amazon Estuary, a\u00e7a\u00ed palm fruit production. We use data from landowner and firm surveys, participatory monitoring of firms, and detailed forest and sawmill operation monitoring to devise financial returns models of smallholder timber micro firms and a\u00e7a\u00ed palm fruit production. We then compare the economics of the two activities to better understand how differences may shape decisions at the small holder scale that impact current land use shifts in the region.", "What ethanol prices would induce growers to switch from agriculture to poplar in Alberta? A multiple options approach ": "The emergence of second generation biofuel industries will be heavily dependent on future prices of ethanol, which could incent landowners to switch land uses from agriculture to growing biofuel feedstocks. In this study, we investigate price levels of ethanol that will be necessary for landowners to grow hybrid poplar. In such an emerging industry, landowners will face a great deal of uncertainty and will consider options to change their production decisions over time. To address this uncertainty, we construct a real options model that considers the dynamic option for Canadian landowners to switch from agriculture to poplar plantations, and also the option to sell poplar plantations for ethanol or pulpwood. The uncertainty in prices for poplar is characterized by time series models of prices for ethanol and pulpwood that characterize price variability as a GARCH process, and reversion to the long term mean average prices. Uncertainty for the value of land allocated to agriculture is characterised by a geometric random walk. Given these price processes, the real options models suggest that current average price levels would have to increase by approximately 35% (i.e. by 0.21 $/L) if only ethanol is considered as an end product, but this increase may be reduced to 32% (i.e., to 0.19 $/L) if the landowner has options to sell the poplar to either ethanol or pulpwood producers. On low value agriculture lands, estimates suggest that an 18% increase relative to current ethanol prices (i.e., of 0.11 $/L) would be needed, which is approximately equal to the current second generation subsidies in Alberta.", "Valuing type and scope of ecosystem conservation: A meta-analysis ": "Ecosystem conservation programs are increasingly incorporating both preservation and restoration strategies for ensuring the flow of ecosystem services from public lands. While preservation and restoration have similar end ecological objectives, differences in these conservation types may create systematic variation in willingness to pay (WTP) for their benefits. There has also been conflicting evidence of whether or not the amount, or scope, of conservation influences the demand for environmental improvements in manners consistent with neoclassical economics (greater value for more conservation). To investigate the sensitivity of conservation values to type and scope, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing evidence. We synthesized 127 data points from 22 primary studies that provided WTP estimates for preservation, forest restoration, and freshwater restoration conducted primarily on public lands. Estimates were derived from choice experiments, contingent rankings, and dichotomous choice contingent valuation studies for conservation programs in Europe, Canada, and the U.S. from 1987 to 2013. We found strong evidence for systematic variation of WTP depending on conservation type and scope. Values for preservation were greater than both forest and freshwater restoration; and freshwater restoration was valued greater than forest restoration. Meta-estimates were found to be sensitive to scope effects, as value increased with conservation intensity but at diminishing marginal rates. We provide quantitative policy analysis in the form of within-sample predictions of mean WTP for each conservation type and scope and conclude with recommendations.", "The impact of forest management plans on trees and carbon: Modeling a decade of harvesting data in Cameroon ": "By 2010, about 25% (180millionha) of The International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) producer countries\u2019 permanent forest estate was being managed using an approved forest management plan (FMP). While the existence of a FMP is often used as evidence of sustainable forest management (SFM), State officials mandated to monitor and verify FMPs\u2019 implementation often lack the technical knowledge and political incentives to assess the changes that have been introduced, notably in terms of harvested volumes and species. Among tropical timber producers, Cameroon is considered to be exemplary for its progressive forest regulatory framework. Here we aim to estimate for the first time in sub-Saharan Africa the causal impact of the implementation of FMPs on harvested volumes, species and carbon stocks. We do so by using a 12-year (1998\u20132009) unbalanced longitudinal data set of a detailed, official harvesting inventory of 81 concessions in Cameroon. Results provide evidence to the theoretical expectations that for many years many practitioners have had on the implementation of SFM, i.e. that FMPs show a substantial opportunity to reduce carbon emissions from forest while presenting logging companies with acceptable financial trade-offs. We explore the technical and political reasons for our findings and conclude that these analyses are important for countries that are underwriting carbon-related schemes in which they propose to reduce their emissions through the effective implementation of SFM. We also demonstrate that producer countries do record useful information that, when effectively used, can help them to inform their policies and improve their sustainable development strategies.", "Willingness to pay for eco-labelled wood furniture: Choice-based conjoint analysis versus open-ended contingent valuation ": "Four convenience samples comprising customers of two IKEA stores, one in England the other in Norway, were obtained for the purpose of investigating willingness to pay (WTP) for an environmental attribute through certification and eco-labelling. Two survey-based valuation methods were applied in each store: conjoint analysis (CA) and contingent valuation (CV). In the sample of English IKEA customers responding to CA questions, extra median WTP for the eco-labelled alternative was 16% of the price of the existing unlabelled alternative. In the sample responding to CV questions, median estimate of the price premium was 7.5%. In the samples of Norwegian IKEA customers, the CA median was 2%, while the CV median was 6%. Only in the English cases did the relation between CA and CV estimates turn out as expected.", "The hidden cost of wildfires: Economic valuation of health effects of wildfire smoke exposure in Southern California ": "There is a growing concern that human health impacts from exposure to wildfire smoke are ignored in estimates of monetized damages from wildfires. Current research highlights the need for better data collection and analysis of these impacts. Using unique primary data, this paper quantifies the economic cost of health effects from the largest wildfire in Los Angeles County's modern history. A cost of illness estimate is $9.50 per exposed person per day. However, theory and empirical research consistently find that this measure largely underestimates the true economic cost of health effects from exposure to a pollutant in that it ignores the cost of defensive actions taken as well as disutility. For the first time, the defensive behavior method is applied to calculate the willingness to pay for a reduction in one wildfire smoke induced symptom day, which is estimated to be $84.42 per exposed person per day.", "Carrots, Sticks and the Brazilian Forest Code: the promising response of small landowners in the Amazon ": "The Brazilian Forest Code has been in existence more than 80 years but has largely been ineffective in reducing deforestation in the Amazon due to a lack of adherence and enforcement. Recent revisions to the law reduced the restoration requirements for Areas of Permanent Preservation (APP) and Legal Reserve (LR) and established new tools to facilitate compliance, encourage environmental conservation and strengthen the supervision and monitoring of protected areas. The goal of these changes is to facilitate compliance, encourage environmental conservation, and strengthen the monitoring of protected areas. This paper investigates the probability that a household in Rondonia, Brazil will set aside land for permanent preservation and, once this decision is made, the extent of restoration. Our results suggest that-even in a region that is heavily deforested and under conditions of weak enforcement-households are complying with the law by developing formal plans for restoration. Most important, we find that access to extension agents, existing APP guidelines, and other policy levers (such as environmental licensing) have made a significant impact on the development of these plans suggesting that the 2012 Forest Code has the potential to impact future land restoration decisions.", "A review of recent developments and applications of partial equilibrium models of the forest sector ": "Recent history has seen an increase in the utilization of partial equilibrium based forest sector models to identify potential impacts of various policies or timber market shocks. These models are particularly useful in that they employ economic theory to capture the interaction of supply and demand in a framework where commodity prices are endogenous to the policy or shock simulated. We present recent developments and linkages between models and review applications of these models to forest policy questions over the previous decade. We conclude with a discussion of potential future directions for such research.", "Co-production of forestry science and society: Evolving interpretations of economic sustainability in Finnish forestry textbooks ": "In this article, we explore how forestry scientists have promoted and defended particular definitions of economic sustainability as a response to socio-economic challenges. Drawing on an analysis of Finnish forestry textbooks, we discuss the evolving conceptualizations in terms of co-production of scientific ideas and social orders. We argue that to fully understand what economic sustainability means in forestry one has to analyze the choices and preferences concerning the components of scientific ideas, and to identify links between these choices and the evolving societal discourses, social norms, rules of authority, power relations and partnerships, as well as historical events.", "Global trade impacts of increasing Europe's bioenergy demand ": "European governments are rapidly turning to biomass to comply with the EU's legislated renewable energy targets for 2020 and 2030. To do so, EU member states will likely have to increase imports of biomass from timber rich regions, which will undoubtedly disrupt international wood product markets. In this study, a static global forest trade model of coniferous wood products is used to examine the effects of expanded demand for wood pellets in Europe to generate reliable electricity. Positive mathematical programming (PMP) is used to calibrate the model to 2012 bilateral trade flows. To assess the impact of increased wood-pellet demand on global forest products, we consider a scenario where EU demand for wood pellets doubles. Model results suggest increases in the world prices of industrial roundwood (1%), particleboard ($34/m3), fibreboard ($30/m3), pulp ($65/t) and pellets (71% to 128%), while the prices of sawnwood and plywood & veneer are projected to fall by $12/m3 and $4/m3, respectively. The gains and losses are unevenly distributed between timber rich and timber poor regions; Russia, Canada and the U.S. experience large net welfare gains of $706 million, $544 million and $416 million, respectively, while Asia loses $1.8 billion. In the forest products sector, the gains outweigh losses with economic benefits increasing by some $4.9 billion, but this is a cost to the consumers of electricity and/or taxpayers in the regions implementing these renewable energy policies. The price of wood pellets is projected to rise between $107 and $154 per tonne. The findings highlight the need to account for the interconnections among softwood forest products globally.", "Does the expansion of biofuels encroach on the forest? ": "In this paper, we explore the role of biofuel production on deforestation in low- and middle-income countries. Since the 2000s, biofuel production has been rapidly developing to address issues of economic development, energy poverty and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the sustainability of biofuels is being challenged, particularly at the environmental level, due to their impact on deforestation and the GHG emissions they can generate as a result of land-use changes. In order to isolate the impact of bioethanol and biodiesel production among classic determinants of deforestation, we used a fixed effects panel model of 112 low- and middle-income countries between 2001 and 2012. Firstly, we found a positive relationship between bioethanol production and deforestation in these countries, among which we highlighted the specificity of Upper-Middle-Income Countries (UMICs). An acceleration of incentives for the production of biofuels from 2006 onwards enabled us to highlight higher marginal impacts for the production of bioethanol in the case of low- and middle-income countries and UMICs. Secondly, for low- and middle-income countries, these results are not significant before 2006. Thirdly, biodiesel production appears to have an impact on deforestation before 2006 on both subsamples. These last two results seem surprising and could be related to the role of biofuel production technologies and the crop yields used in their production.", "Services and industrial development: analysis of industrial policy, trends and issues for the forest-based sector ": "Increasing role of services in the economy has been recognized in the forest-based sector, yet the phenomenon and its possible impacts remain little studied. The forest-based sector companies operate in international markets and their products feed into a wide range of industrial activities. Increasing role of services as change in the operating environment of these companies can be expected to influence also on the upstream of the forest-based value chains, and better understanding of such developments is needed. This study analyses documents of the EU industrial policy and economic cooperation at international level from the year 2000 onwards, and asks: 1) how the increasing role of services is assessed as part of industrial development, 2) which trends and drivers are identified, and 3) whether and how the issues related to the natural resources base are addressed with regard to this phenomenon. The study concludes that instead of thinking of the increasing role of services as a trend in the external environment of the forest-based sector, it can also be assessed as a symptom of more profound changes underway in the industrial production. The recent industrial policy documents emphasize the new technology-enabled production modes that revolutionize how production, distribution and value capture can be organized. By assessing the developments only with accustomed metrics, such as number and volume of services, important opportunities and challenges may remain unrecognized for the forest-based sector. The paper concludes questions for future research to address this issue.", "Sequester or substitute\u2014Consequences of increased production of wood based energy on the carbon balance in Finland ": "Forests play an important role in mitigating climate change. Forests can sequester carbon from the atmosphere and provide biomass, which can be used to substitute for fossil fuels or energy-intensive materials. International climate policies favor the use of wood to substitute for fossil fuels rather than using forests as carbon sink. We examine the trade off between sequestering carbon in forests and substituting wood for fossil fuels in Finland. For Finland to meet its EU targets for the use of renewable energy by 2020, a considerable increase in the use of wood for energy is necessary. We compare scenarios in which the wood energy targets are fully or partially met to a reference case where policies favoring wood based energy production are removed. Three models are used to project fossil fuel substitution and changes in forest carbon sinks in the scenarios through 2035.\n                  Finnish forests are a growing carbon sink in all scenarios. However, net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be higher in the medium term if Finland achieves its current wood energy targets than if the use of energy wood stagnates or decreases. The volume of GHG emissions avoided by replacing coal, peat and fossil diesel with wood is outweighed by the loss in carbon sequestered in forests due to increased biomass removals. Therefore, the current wood energy targets seem excessive and harmful to the climate. In particular, biodiesel production has a significant, negative impact on net emissions in the period considered. However, we did not consider risks such as forest fires, wind damage and diseases, which might weaken the sequestration policy. The potential albedo impacts of harvesting the forests were not considered either.", "Forestry's golden rule and the development of the optimal forest rotation literature ": "", "Agricultural biodiversity and farm level technical efficiency: An empirical investigation ": "Land degradation with deforestation and loss of biodiversity has been considered one of the most serious environmental problems for developing countries. The lower level of agricultural productivity resulting in the inability to obtain a sufficient level of production in agriculture leads rural communities to exert pressure on forest resources while damaging the ecological services provided by them. Promotion of economic efficiency as well as achieving environmentally sustainable farming practices can help maintain a sustainable agricultural sector while reducing land degradation and pressure on forests in rural communities. In this context this study investigates the relationships between different indicators of agricultural biodiversity (crop diversity, livestock diversity and agro-diversity) and farm level technical efficiency (TE). A survey conducted covering 723 farms in Sri Lanka is used for the analysis. The results show that crop diversity, livestock diversity and agro diversity are positively related with farm level TE. Hence, it is clear that maintaining more diverse farming systems is crucial to reducing farm level inefficiency and thereby improving the welfare of rural households while reducing the pressure on extensive agricultural practices which has increased global deforestation. Such diversity is especially important for subsistence agricultural practices which are still widespread in most Asian countries.", "Influences of nonindustrial private forest landowners\u2019 management priorities on the timber harvest decision\u2014A case study in France ": "Recently, there has been a demand to increase the wood mobilisation from French private forests which are a significant part of the national wood supply. Nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owners are frequently not only timber producers, but also providers of forest amenities, from which they derive a private utility as well as positive externalities for the rest of the society. This is often addressed as a limit to wood exploitation, since generally there is a trade-off between timber production and amenities. However, the forest property fragmentation and the passive management of some private forest owners are also considered as restraining the wood supply. We propose an econometric analysis of the harvesting decision with particular attention to the role of NIPF landowners\u2019 management objectives. We defined four categories of management objectives: \u201cproduction-oriented\u201d, \u201cproduction & amenities\u201d, \u201camenities-oriented\u201d, and \u201cno objectives\u201d, using a sample of 432 French NIPF landowners. The aim was to identify the relevant factors influencing the harvest decision, and, in particular, the role of amenities-oriented objectives and no-objectives. Results showed that a change in the management objective from production-oriented to amenities-oriented significantly reduced the probability of harvesting. The lack of management objectives as well as absenteeism, however, exhibited an even higher negative effect. Consistently with a utility maximisation framework, both economic variables (timber price and income) and landowners\u2019 socio-demographic characteristics were significant predictors of the harvesting decision. From a policy viewpoint, our results suggest to address incentives schemes on passive forest owners in order to increase wood production.", "Wood biomass use for energy in Europe under different assumptions of coal, gas and CO2 emission prices and market conditions ": "This study examines the effects of different coal, natural gas and carbon emission prices and market situations on the use of wood for electricity and heat production in the European Union. The analysis is carried out using the global forest sector model EFI-GTM expanded to cover electricity and heat production from wood, coal, natural gas, wind and solar energy. Analysis shows that with low coal and gas prices, use of wood for energy will be limited to low cost logging residues. With high coal, and especially natural gas prices, industrial wood also comes to be used for energy. At a carbon price of 100\u20ac/tCO2, some 32Mm3 of industrial wood, in addition to 224Mm3 of logging residues, are projected to be used for electricity and heat in the EU region (including Norway and Switzerland) in 2030. The relatively low quantity of industrial wood used by the energy sector despite the collapse of the use of coal is explained by the fact that under high CO2 prices, other energy forms like natural gas, solar and wind energy become more and more competitive. However, the amount of industrial wood used for energy may substantially increase with subsidies for using wood for electricity and heat, even with relatively low carbon prices. With a high coal and gas price and a carbon price of 100\u20ac/t, a subsidy of 30\u20ac/MWh to the wood based and coal with wood co-firing electricity production will have a significant impact on the European wood based sector. Depending on the development of the market demand for forest industry products, such a subsidy may cause a 10\u201312.5% reduction in forest products production, a 6\u20139% increase in harvest level, about 30\u201360% increase in the pulpwood prices, and a 6\u20139 fold increase of wood imports in the EU, compared to the respective case without a subsidy in 2030.", "Shades of Green: Measuring the value of urban forests in the housing market ": "Urban areas can contain public parks, protected forests, unprotected (or undeveloped) forest areas, and trees growing around a house or in the neighborhood surrounding the house. Each type of forest cover provides different amenities to the homeowner and to society at large. In particular, while trees on a parcel of land or in a neighborhood may add value for homeowners, the ecological value of these trees as habitat is far less than large, unbroken parcels of forest. We explore different definitions of forest cover and greenness and assess the relative value of these various types of forest cover to homeowners. Using data from the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, we test the hypothesis that trees on a parcel or in the neighborhood around that parcel are substitutes for living near large blocks of forest. The findings have implications for land-use planning efforts and habitat conservation in particular.", "An economic analysis of the potential contribution of forest biomass to the EU RES target and its implications for the EU forest industries ": "This study addresses the effects of increasing energy wood prices on the EU forest sector and on the use of wood biomass for energy. We examine different energy wood price levels under two contrasting scenarios of future global development, defined by the A1 and B2 storylines of IPCC. A1 depicts increased globalization and rapid economic growth. In B2, the economic growth is more modest, and the world is more environmentally conscious and regionally oriented. The analysis carried out using the global forest sector model EFI-GTM shows that as energy wood prices increase, the wood imports and reallocation of wood from competing industrial users such as board manufacturers or the pulp and paper industry also increase strongly. The quantity of wood directed from the forest industry to the energy sector would at most be around 20Mtoe (million tons of oil equivalent) in terms of energy, given a price of 100\u20ac/m3 of energy wood. Still, this would cover only around 8% of the European Union's RES target for 2020, and an even lower share for 2030. For some forest industry sectors like production of pulp and panels that would mean an important output reduction, around 20\u201325%. Additional felling could be an important source of wood for bioenergy in the near future, when utilization of the forest resource potential is still not very high. However, toward 2030, forest resource utilization is projected to increase and might become a limiting factor for additional biomass potentials. Given the relatively high economic growth assumed in the scenarios and the rather strong development in the demand for forest industry products, there is a considerable chance that the supply of wood biomass for energy will be largely limited to logging residues in the long run.", "A Literature Review on Women\u2019s Oral Health Across the Life Span ": "The importance of women\u2019s oral health and its association with overall systemic health cannot be overemphasized. Poor oral health can have several detrimental effects on a woman\u2019s health across her life span. This article reviews the literature and describes how nurses, nurse practitioners, and nurse-midwives can incorporate oral cavity examinations into their care of women.", "Law enforcement and deforestation: Lessons for Indonesia from Brazil ": "The Government of Indonesia has committed to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. However, the country suffers from one of the most significant illegal logging and illegal land clearing conditions in the world. Brazil was in a similar condition to Indonesia when it implemented an aggressive and strategic forest law enforcement policy which enable it to significantly reduce deforestation. Indonesia does not have such a strategic approach to forest law enforcement. It should consider the features of Brazil\u2019s strategy in order to improve its forest law enforcement activities in order to be able to deliver on the reduction of forest emissions that it has pledged in Nationally Determined Contributions statement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Indonesia\u2019s efforts, and those of other countries, would be enhanced by research on the reasons at the root of the unsuccessful forest law enforcement policies and activities over the two decades since the spotlight was put on illegal logging at the first Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade conference held in Bali in 2001.", "The Swedish forestry model: More of everything? ": "\u201cThe Swedish forestry model\u201d refers to the forest regime that evolved following the 1993 revision of the Swedish Forestry Act. It is key to Swedish forest politics and used to capture the essence of a sustainable way of managing forests. However, the ideas, institutions and practices comprising the model have not been comprehensively analyzed previously. Addressing this knowledge gap, we use frame analysis and a Pathways approach to investigate the underlying governance model, focusing on the way policy problems are addressed, goals, implementation procedures, outcomes and the resulting pathways to sustainability. We suggest that the institutionally embedded response to pressing sustainability challenges and increasing demands is expansion, inclusion and integration: more of everything. The more-of-everything pathway is influenced by ideas of ecological modernization and the optimistic view that existing resources can be increased. Our findings suggest that in effect it prioritizes the economic dimension of sustainability. While broadening out policy formulation it closes down the range of alternative outputs, a shortcoming that hampers its capacity to respond to current sustainability challenges. Consequently, there is a need for a broad public debate regarding not only the role of forests in future society, but also the operationalization of sustainable development.", "Indonesia's land reform: Implications for local livelihoods and climate change ": "One of the main components of Indonesia's Just Economy policy is extensive and rapid land reform, which targets about 12% of the country's land area for redistribution to farmers and communities by 2019. Much of the reform is occurring on forest land. At the same time, the country has pledged a significant reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, two thirds of which is to be achieved from forests. Hence agrarian reform potentially conflicts with emission reduction commitments. This research analyses how the redistribution of forests, with emphasis on the social forestry program, might affect people's livelihoods and Indonesia's capacity to deliver on its climate change commitments. With reference to Central Kalimantan province, we find that the land reform policy has increased the area distributed to local people through the streamlining of processes. However, ambitious targets and hurried distribution of land have posed significant challenges for processes and implementation. They result in partial understanding of the schemes, rights and responsibilities, inappropriate site allocation and types of forestland being distributed, and inadequate consideration for community capacity and local governance. Importantly, the resources allocated to grant these rights have not been accompanied by equal attention to foster subsequent actual land-based livelihood activities and forest protection. Hence the reform's potential to improve local livelihoods and contribute to climate change mitigation in Central Kalimantan is unlikely to be fully realized in the near future. We suggest that careful consideration be given to the processes of distribution, the type of forests being assigned, attention and support to foster implementation, and monitoring and enforcement of regulations.", "Forest and wildlife resource-conservation efforts based on indigenous knowledge: The case of Nharira community in Chikomba district, Zimbabwe ": "Forest and wildlife resources are indispensable for the provision of ecosystem goods and services; as well as spiritual and cultural values in rural areas. In most unprotected areas, these resources are increasingly under threat prompting indigenous communities to apply their local knowledge in an effort to conserve them. Therefore, this study documents how the Nharira community of Chikomba district, Zimbabwe is using indigenous knowledge to conserve forest and wildlife resources. Qualitative methods involving interviews and focus group discussions with villagers were used to gather data. The participants were purposively selected by the traditional leaders on the basis of their rich indigenous knowledge and participation in cultural ceremonies and rituals. The study found wide use of (a) customary rules and regulations, (b) customs and rituals, (c) taboos and totems, and (d) metaphors and proverbs applied in forest and wildlife resource conservation. These forms of indigenous knowledge constitute the social and religious values of the Nharira community that are used in conserving the human-environment system.", "Reducing forest and land fires through good palm oil value chain governance ": "United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to protect the planet and ensure prosperity. In reaching SDGs, Indonesia's palm oil industry represents a solution for the economy but a problem for environment-related goals. Palm oil is a tremendous land-based commodity that supports the subnational and national economies of Indonesia. With 11.4 million ha of plantations, palm oil has contributed USD 20.75 billion in 2015 to Indonesia's export income. However, fire has been involved in the development and replanting of palm oil plantations. Smoke haze from fires harm the economy, the environment, and the health of millions of people. The research took a normative approach to understand whether the current palm oil value chain governance comply with the principle of good governance. The focus was on analyzing options to improve the current governance towards good governance, which is able to reduce fire uses. We reviewed previous investigations, and carried out focus group discussions, field interviews, and value chain analysis. We found that the palm oil economy distributed enormous value added to those participating in the chain. However, the fire uses in land preparation can be altered by using coercion, dis(incentives) and dominant information that held by district and central governments, growers and mil. The potential benefits from green products, a strengthened growers' association, moving up scenarios can be used to compensate the \u2018benefits\u2019 of using fire. Lessons learnt from the palm oil commodity chain in Indonesia, when the economy and the environment are contested, can be used by other countries to reach towards their SDGs.", "Policy design for forest carbon sequestration: A review of the literature ": "Forest carbon enhancement provides a low-cost opportunity in climate policy, but needs efficient policy design to be implemented. This paper reviews studies in economics on efficient design of policies for forest carbon sequestration and compares their findings against design systems in practice. Specific design problems are associated with the heterogeneity of landowners, uncertainty, additionality, and permanence in carbon projects. Different types of discounting of the value of the forest carbon sink compared with emissions abatement are suggested in the literature for management of most design problems, together with optimal contract design and emissions baselines for managing additionality and permanence in carbon sequestration. Design systems in practice, where forest carbon corresponds to 0.5% of all carbon volume subject to a pricing mechanism, mainly rely on additionality tests by approved standards on a project-by-project basis, and on buffer credits for management of permanence. Further development of forest carbon sinks as offsets in voluntary and compliance markets can be facilitated by applying tools for contract design and offset baseline management recommended in the literature.", "Deforestation and the Paris climate agreement: An assessment of REDD+ in the national climate action plans ": "More than ten years after REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) entered the UN climate negotiations, its current state and future direction are a matter of contention. This paper analyses 162 INDCs (Intended National Determined Contributions), or climate action plans, to assess whether and how countries plan to use REDD+ in their implementation the Paris Agreement. Our analysis suggests that REDD+ continues to have political traction. Many tropical countries still have expectations of REDD+, and hope that public and private donors will support chronically underfunded domestic conservation programs. However, the expectations are not formulated in detail. We argue that until the questions of how to finance REDD+ and how to deal with the drivers of deforestation are resolved, REDD is unlikely to move quickly from formulated INDCs plans to implementation on the ground.", "The role of science in forest policy\u2013Experiences by EFI ": "There has been increasing requests for evidence-based policy, especially in complex issues such as climate change, biodiversity and bioenergy questions. Scientists have also been active in this front, e.g., such as European Academies Science Advisory Council (2017, 2019) and by writing Open Letters (e.g., Beddington et al., 2017; De Wever et al., 2017; Berndes et al., 2018). However, at the same time, science expertise is contested. Populist \u201cpost-truth\u201d politicians and social media warriors have questioned the legitimacy of science-based information. The issue is made also more complex due to the fact that there has been occasionally striking disparity between what the scientists' messages are. Moreover, there is an increasing amount of science information available. According to UNESCO (2015), almost 1.3 million scientific articles were published in 2014 alone. Clearly, the decision-maker needs scientists and science-based intermediary organizations that can synthesize the best science information in a format that is easily accessible, as IPCC is doing. But science-policy support work has its own challenges, e.g., it can be impacted by pressures that mix science-evidence with vested interests. In this article, we address the following questions: What should the role of science be in informing forest policy-making? Why do scientists seem to disagree on forest issues? What are the lessons learnt from the European Forest Institute's (EFI) science-policy work since 2015?", "Developing community-based forest ecosystem service management to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ": "At the site level, communities who manage and conserve forests are parties influencing as well as affected by deforestation and forest degradation. Hence, understanding their roles in supporting or avoiding deforestation and forest degradation is important to support national effort in reducing carbon emissions from forest. This study is aimed at: (1) examining communities' needs for forest products and services; (2) analysing communities' interests towards REDD+ activities in reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation activities; and (3) analysing options to be developed into management plans for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. It examines 9 communities in the provinces of Papua, Central Kalimantan, and Riau. It employs a qualitative approach through stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions and field observations. The study found that communities face some constraints in managing forest ecosystem services that impede their role in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation that can be expected from the utilisation of non-timber forest products and ecosystem services. Communities' interests in joining programs to reduce emission from deforestation and forest degradation are diverse, but their capacity in planning and in systematic forest use, in including carbon conservation programs are relatively low. Hence, strengthening community-level organisational structures and developing robust plans for sustainable management of forest ecosystem services are needed to support communities' participation in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.", "Certification of tropical forests: A private instrument of public interest? A focus on the Congo Basin ": "Forest management certification seems to be stagnating or even receding in the Congo basin. This is attributable to the financial difficulties of some European companies, but might also be a consequence of unexpected interactions with the FLEGT process, which is lagging behind in the Congo Basin. Although this process and private certifications are expected to be complementary, the reluctance of EU authorities to give certified timber a \u201cgreen lane\u201d for entering the European market may discourage concessionaires from seeking a stringent certificate, while the demand for timber is increasingly shifting towards markets in China and other emerging countries that are not ready to pay a \u201cprice premium\u201d. An underlying issue is the difficulty in qualifying the added value of certified timber over legal timber, although some research has shown how certification has closed loopholes in public regulations. Recognition of the public interest of certification could be achieved through fully trusting private certificates for due diligence procedures and, eventually, for obtaining FLEGT licences. Public verification and traceability efforts would be re-centred on non-certified timber and the informal sector, which intersects with forest tenure issues. While some countries wish to make certification compulsory, this article prefers to propose the use of financial incentives through differentiated forest taxes, in order to preserve the credibility of standards, and it details potential mechanisms that could reinforce the independence of auditors.", "Towards sustainability? Forest-based circular bioeconomy business models in Finnish SMEs ": "In line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN 2030 Agenda, the circular bioeconomy concept is gaining greater political momentum and research interest. A circular bioeconomy implies a more efficient resource management of bio-based renewable resources by integrating circular economy principles into the bioeconomy. These ideas have been well received at industry level since they are deemed to foster cost reductions, innovation and competitiveness. While recent scientific literature has dwelt on sustainability-related circular business models, empirical research on company-level implementation is only just emerging. Our study contributes to addressing this research lacuna by seeking answers to two questions: 1. How do small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) propose, create and deliver, and capture value through circular bioeconomy business models?; and 2. What are the business challenges and opportunities related to the operationalization of such business models? To this end, we employed content analysis on interview data gathered from managers in Finnish SME companies from the field of packaging, textiles, composite materials, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. We outlined the main business model archetypes, and identified the key characteristics that enable value capture and delivery for various stakeholders. The contribution of this study is duly two-fold. From the perspective of a theoretical contribution, we expand and refine the conceptualization of sustainable circular bioeconomy and related business models. In addition, based on our findings, we provide insights and recommendations for researchers and policy-makers to advance the sustainability transition to a circular bioeconomy in the context of the forest-based industry, and for the management of SMEs to reflect on company viability and growth.", "Policies affecting the implementation of REDD+ in Indonesia (cases in Papua, Riau and Central Kalimantan) ": "Indonesia was expected to enter the implementing phase of REDD+ in 2015. Some technical and regulatory documents have been prepared within the framework of national REDD+ elemen. However, the development of REDD+ was constrained leading to the delay of the full implementation of REDD+. This study investigates the factors that may support or impede the effectiveness of REDD+ policies. It analyses policy structures and the behaviour of actors within and outside the forestry sector affecting the preparation of REDD+ implementation. The study was conducted in the three provinces of Papua, Central Kalimantan and Riau. The results show that most of the existing policy structures support REDD+ implementation. However, there are some regulations negatively impacting the implementation. Government actors at the central level have fragmented power, need for an actor that can manage coordination among the relevant actors. In addition, REDD+ documents and regulations are considered less legitimate and cannot fully support the implementation of REDD+ in Indonesia. Indonesia is not fully ready to implement national REDD+ since some current policies need to be improved to enhance the effectiveness of REDD+ policies.", "Human values as catalysts and consequences of social innovations ": "We studied the role of human values in social innovations (SIs) in four forest-dependent communities (FDCs) in Europe. We draw on 71 semi-structured interviews with FDC members in Finland, Slovenia, the UK and Ukraine, and a survey of householders (n\u202f=\u202f150) and focus group interviews with related stakeholders in Ukraine. The material collected was analyzed with mixed methods with respect to relational values as catalysts and consequences of SI. Relational values, which are derivative of the relationships between human and non-human world, and responsibilities towards these relationships, were divided into three categories: Doing, Belonging and Respecting. Doing encompasses the individual's perspective of the opportunities offered by nature to individuals. Belonging encompasses a communal dimension of values manifested as the experience of \u201cbeing at home\u201d in social collectives and landscapes. Respecting addresses environmental and social justice. Common cause for SI was the need of FDCs to sustain or enhance relational values linked to forests while, once emerged, SIs also have potential to become global game-changers. SI encompasses the reconfiguration of: i) forest management and use, ii) decision-making structures and processes, and iii) stakeholder's perceptions of sustainability. Examples include the co-management arrangement between a State forestry enterprise and the local community, buying woodland from the State by the FDCs to enable community forestry, reinvention of traditional forest management, and the active involvement of FDC members in halting illegal logging. As a conclusion, we developed a general value hierarchy accounting for value plurality in which relational, instrumental and intrinsic values can be interpreted from any perspective.", "Effects of carnivore presence on hunting lease pricing in South Sweden ": "Carnivore conservation is considered essential because the species offer significant benefits to biodiversity. However, their predation on ungulates reduces ungulate populations with subsequent effects on hunters' harvests and welfare. In this paper, we use the hedonic price method to estimate the effects of large carnivores on hunting lease prices. We disentangle the impact of carnivores through their effect on game harvest from their effect on hunters' preferences. Results reveal that lynx impose a significant economic cost to owners of hunting rights due to the predation of game. On average, the implicit cost of an additional lynx family is SEK 1.51 million (EUR 0.162 million) per year, and with 95% certainty, the cost per lynx family is at least SEK 340 thousand (EUR 36.6 thousand) per year.", "Reducing emissions from land use change in Indonesia: An overview ": "The goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change cannot be achieved without a significant reduction in emissions from forests. Reductions of emissions from land use, particularly forests, account for a quarter of the reductions pledged in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by Parties to the UNFCCC. The papers included in this Special Issue of Forest Policy and Economics provide a contribution to the analysis of the design and implementation of the NDCs and REDD+ by considering aspects of reducing emissions from forests in Indonesia. Indonesia is the second largest emitter of greenhouses gases from forest after Brazil, but it becomes the largest emitter from forests in years when it experiences significant forest and peat fires.", "Trees for life: The ecosystem service contribution of trees to food production and livelihoods in the tropics ": "Despite expanding interest in ecosystem service research over the past three decades, in-depth understanding of the contribution of forests and trees to food production and livelihoods remains limited. This review synthesizes the current evidence base examining the contribution of forest and trees to agricultural production and livelihoods in the tropics, where production often occurs within complex land use mosaics that are increasingly subjected to concomitant climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Using systematic review methodology we found 74 studies investigating the effect of forest or tree-based ecosystem service provision on a range of outcomes such as crop yield, biomass, soil fertility, and income. Our findings suggest that when incorporating forests and trees within an appropriate and contextualized natural resource management strategy, there is potential to maintain, and in some cases, enhance yields comparable to solely monoculture systems. Furthermore, this review has illustrated the potential of achieving net livelihood gains through integrating trees on farms, providing rural farmers with additional income sources, and greater resilience strategies to adapt to market or climatic shocks. However, we also identify significant gaps in the current knowledge that demonstrate a need for larger-scale, longer term research to better understand the contribution of forest and trees within the broader landscape and their associated impacts on livelihoods and food production systems.", "REDD+ engagement types preferred by Japanese private firms: The challenges and opportunities in relation to private sector participation ": "This article examines the REDD+ engagement types preferred by Japanese private firms at the project level including their motivation and rationale for the engagement and explores the challenges and opportunities in relation to their participation. We analyzed 148 responses to a survey questionnaire mailed to participants across Japan and the responses from in-depth face-to-face interviews with representatives from 11 selected firms. 42 firms (28%) stated that they are interested in engaging in REDD+-related activities in the future. Of these, 33 firms aim to enhance their corporate values, while the other nine aim to increase profits. The most popular engagement types were providing support, as a form of corporate social responsibility (CSR), to third parties such as NGOs that are engaged in REDD+ projects (21 firms) and purchasing REDD+ carbon credits derived from REDD+ projects to offset the greenhouse gases emitted by the firm (or carbon-neutral CSR) (18 firms). The firms would be willing to participate in REDD+ in some form in the future if some of the current challenges are addressed. These challenges included: few opportunities for firms seeking attractive \u201cstories\u201d in forest conservation to pair with local partners that can help to realize the firms' \u201cstories\u201d or desires; difficulties in gaining understanding and trust from host countries' governments/communities; and the lack of a consortium to implement REDD+-related activities by bundling firms that find it difficult to work alone. It was also confirmed that some firms seeking profits from REDD+ carbon credit development and trading activities continue to face barriers commonly identified in earlier studies such as market uncertainty, unclear regulatory frameworks, and the costs of measuring, reporting, and verifying the carbon credits. However, the present study did not support the findings of earlier studies that the cost of CSR activities is considered to be relatively high because CSR budgeting is often based on time horizons of less than 5\u202fyears. We propose some policy initiatives designed to increase private sector participation in REDD+ that will contribute to achieving the host countries' mitigation targets in relation to both REDD+ and nationally determined contributions.", "Village transfers for the environment: Lessons from community-based development programs and the village fund ": "", "Exploring the design of jurisdictional REDD+: The case of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia ": "Jurisdictional approaches to REDD+ have received less attention than project-based REDD+ activities, yet they are needed for the successful implementation of REDD+ at the national level. Three subnational levels can be considered for the implementation of jurisdictional REDD+ in Indonesia: Provincial, District and Village. REDD+ implementation should involve all levels of jurisdiction, however, the implementation at the village level will be better coordinated at the district level due to the size of areas and potential emissions reduced. In this paper, we estimate the potential contribution of sub-national jurisdictions to reducing deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions using a case study from Central Kalimantan. District governments can contribute to reducing emissions by stopping deforestation from oil palm concessions, which in the case study considered has the potential of reducing emissions by as much as 15% from the business as usual scenario. Provincial governments have the authority to reduce emissions from state forest areas. In Central Kalimantan, if no more deforestation occurs in production forests, the projected avoided emissions between 2013 and 2020 are about 21% from the business as usual scenario.", "Mapping certified forests for sustainable management - A global tool for information improvement through participatory and collaborative mapping ": "There are currently no spatially explicit, openly accessible data available on forest certification below national level, so understanding the drivers of certification in the past, examining the scope for further certification and using this information for development of future sustainable forest management strategies is challenging. Hence, this paper presents a methodology for the development of a global map of certified forest areas at 1km resolution in order to satisfy this information need. Validation of the map with certified areas in Russia showed reasonable results, but the lack of openly accessible data requires broadening the strategy for improving the global certification map in the future. Thus, the second aim of the paper is to present an online tool for visualization and interactive improvement of the global forest certification product through collaborative mapping, aiming at a range of stakeholders including third-party certifiers, green NGOs, forestry organizations, decision-makers, scientists and local experts. Such an approach can help to make more accurate information on forest certification available, promote the sharing of data and encourage more transparent and sustainable forest management, i.e. both producers and users can benefit from this online tool.", "European private forest owner typologies: A review of methods and use ": "The increasing diversity of non-industrial private forest owners (PFOs) in Europe has been recognized by policy makers and the forestry sector at large. Typologies of these owners have been developed to provide an understanding of the diversity of owners' attitudes, values, beliefs, management objectives and behaviour. We analyzed PFO typologies from 28 European countries published from 1985 to 2015 in peer-reviewed journals and grey literature with respect to 1) research approaches and methods used; 2) typology objectives and problems addressed; 3) policy and management recommendations given. Using an on-line questionnaire we asked the first authors of the most relevant publications to retrospectively assess 4) the use of their typologies in education, science and forest policy. Most of the 66 publications reviewed share the common objective of providing a better understanding of forest ownership. Typologies were also developed to address roundwood mobilization, delivery of public goods, forest management approaches, involvement in PFO associations and entrepreneurship. The most common methodological approach was quantitative where owners were grouped by k-means clustering into 2 to 6 types and labelled with various names. Most frequently used labels were Multiobjective owners, Recreationists, Investors, Farmers, Indifferent owners, Conservationists, Multifunctional owners and Self-employed owners. Policy implications remain vague. The typologies had mostly been used in teaching and occasionally by politicians, civil servants or stakeholders. Only a half of the typologies had a follow-up study or was updated over time by the authors. After decades of classifying PFOs, it seems necessary to explore the link between typologies and forest owners' overt behaviour.", "Governing the design of national REDD+: An analysis of the power of agency ": "This paper investigates how three aspects of governance systems, namely the policy context, the influence of key agents and their discursive practices, are affecting national-level processes of policy design aimed at REDD+, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries. We conducted analysis in six REDD+ countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam). The paper combines three methods: policy analysis, media-based discourse analysis and policy network analysis. The paper shows that policies both within and outside the forestry sector that support deforestation and forest degradation create path dependencies and entrenched interests that hamper policy change. In addition, most dominant policy coalitions do not challenge business-as-usual trajectories, reinforcing existing policy and political structures. No minority policy coalitions are directly tackling the root causes of deforestation and forest degradation, that is, the politico-economic conditions driving them. Instead they focus on environmental justice issues, such as calls for increased participation of indigenous people in decision-making. Only in two of the six countries are these transformational change coalitions vocal enough to be heard, yet to exercise their agency effectively and to support more substantial reforms, these coalitions would need the participation of more influential policy actors, particularly state agencies that have the authority to make binding decisions about policy. Furthermore, discourses supporting transformational change would need to be reflected in institutional practices and policy decisions.", "Assessment and optimization of sustainable forest wood supply chains \u2013 A systematic literature review ": "When it was first introduced, the concept of sustainability in the forestry sector had a narrow focus on sustainable wood production. Since then, this concept has evolved and it now considers now the three sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental and social) of the whole forest wood supply chain. The main objective of this study is then to review assessment and optimization studies that consider the forest wood supply chain and at least one of the sustainability dimensions. To accomplish this goal, a total number of 188 papers, published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals from 1995 to 2017, were reviewed. These papers have been classified according to the sustainability dimensions explored, the stakeholder\u2019s involvement, the modeling approaches applied, the supply chain decision levels treated, the uncertainty inclusion, and case study analyzed. Most of the studies reviewed (84.6%) considered only two sustainability dimensions: economic (31.9%), environmental (13.8%), or a combination of both (38.8%). The first study including the three sustainability dimensions was published in 2005. Most of the studies reviewed (64.9%) focus on the bioenergy industry in Europe and North America, due to the growing interest in using biomass to substitute fossil fuels in energy production. The final part of the paper presents the identified specific features of sustainable forest wood supply chains and discusses a future research agenda in the area.", "Shifting regimes of management and uses of forests: What might REDD+ implementation mean for community forestry? Evidence from Nepal ": "At a time when many developing countries are preparing to implement REDD+, there is debate on the possible implications for existing community forestry (CF) governance. Drawing on a REDD+ pilot undertaken in Nepal, this paper seeks to investigate how REDD+ has been downscaled into the community forestry context and with what implications for CF governance. The analysis is guided by three research questions: how are the objectives and discourses underpinning REDD+ translated into actions at the local level; how do the proponents of REDD+ make the problems and solutions technical in order to design the interventions; and what are the implications of REDD+ design for CF governance and what changes in rules and practices on forest management might result from these? The study comprised a review of the pilot project documentation and field study. In-depth interviews, focused group discussions and observations were conducted with forest user groups both within and outside the REDD+ pilot area. Findings indicate that the pilot design and implementation was essentially to show that REDD+ could be implemented in CF and focused on developing a carbon monitoring mechanism which local people could be engaged in. The community forest user groups (CFUG) in the pilot sites have increased forest surveillance and tightened the rules regarding certain uses of forests. We argue that the technical and financial logic of REDD+ have had implications for CF governance, risks of co-opting local voices and has contributed to an ongoing commercialisation of community forests, at the cost of the livelihoods of the poorest people.", "Protected areas, household environmental incomes and well-being in the Greater Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem ": "Protected areas are an important cornerstone in the attempt to halt habitat and species losses. While it is widely recognized that local communities impact on conservation outcomes, there is a limited understanding of the economic importance of environmental resources in protected areas to local household incomes and well-being. This inhibits the development and implementation of efficient conservation policies. This paper, using the iconic case of the Greater Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem and its surrounding local communities in Tanzania and Kenya, quantifies the household-level economic importance of this protected area. Data was collected using well-being and environmentally augmented structured household surveys administered to 985 randomly selected households in 25 communities. Results documented high reliance on environmental income of the poorest, a negative relationship between environmental reliance and well-being, with households closer to the protected area having higher environmental reliance and lower well-being. Hence, degradation of protected area habitats will negatively and disproportionately affect the income and may further reduce the well-being of the poorest households. Sustainable protected area management must address human well-being as well as conservation objectives. Increasing access to education and building skills to promote alternative non-environmental based livelihood activities will promote both conservation and development objectives.", "Application of the Microsoft Excel Solver tool in the solution of optimization problems of heat exchanger network systems ": "Optimization of heat exchanger networks (HENS) is a field of interest in Chemical Engineering. The aim is to use the residual heat of process streams to raise the temperature of other process streams which are cold, thus minimizing the use of hot and cold utilities. The usual way to deal with this task is to pose a linear programming problem according to a transshipment model in order to minimize either the general services consumptions or the number of hot and cold stream matchings required. This optimization is subjected to several restrictions given by the energy balances corresponding to each heat exchange.\n                  The high number of variables and equations obliges the use of specific software to solve these problems, e.g. GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System). However, this software is not intuitive and requires a long time of training and a certain level of practice for the students to adequately use it.\n                  This work describes the use of Microsoft Excel-Solver for the sequential solving of HENS optimization problems according to the transshipment model. Solver is a much simpler, intuitive and easily available tool for the students who, besides, usually learn how to use it in the first years of their degree, in Informatics or similar subjects. Thus, it is not necessary to spend extra time in the teaching of the software, time that may be devoted to other contents.\n                  This paper presents an example of HENS problem proposed in the subject Simulation and Optimization of Chemical Processes corresponding to the Joint Master in Chemical Engineering of the Rey Juan Carlos University and the Aut\u00f3noma University of Madrid and solved by the students using Excel-Solver.", "Workshops of innovation in chemical engineering to train communication skills in science and technology ": "This paper shows the application of an innovate pedagogical approach based on the project-based learning technique, focused on the training of communication skills in the framework of a workshop of innovation in chemical engineering. Written, graphical verbal, and non-verbal communication were tackled. For that purpose, a project of technological innovation was developed by the students in teams within the specific area of chemical engineering. A professional-like environment was simulated by a final workshop where the students defenced and supported their project by using oral presentation and production of a poster and a video. Several surveys were performed before and after the project application. The final survey revealed that both students and lecturers perceived an improvement on the communication skills of the students. Moreover, both lecturers and students declared satisfaction with the methodology, recommending its application in other disciplines.", "Reprint of: Motivational active learning: An integrated approach to teaching and learning process control ": "Process Control is a course that needs a thorough understanding of how the different unit operations work and what are the implications of changing operation variables in a process. This paper presents how education innovation can help students to improve their learning and understanding of the different concepts and thus to get better results in the subject and to achieve the desired outcomes. The Process Control Course is taught in the Bachelor Degree in Chemical Engineering at the Technical University of Madrid. Different methodologies have been integrated and used in the course as: flipped classroom, peer instruction or gamification. In order to implement the mentioned methods, the following material has been developed: screencasts, concept tests, trivia contest and simulations besides the traditional lecturing material (slides and text). First year results show high student motivation, higher participation in class and better results (marks) in the subject.", "Improving teamwork skills and enhancing deep learning via development of board game using cooperative learning method in Reaction Engineering course ": "To produce well-rounded students with excellent teamwork skills and creativity, one of the teaching strategies that can be adopted in engineering education is cooperative learning. This study aims to enhance creativity, deep learning and improve teamwork skills among the third-year chemical engineering students using cooperative learning strategy. Complex instruction method is adopted by instructing the students to develop a board game and embed technical based questions, which are related to kinetic and reactor design subject (KRD) and other two courses, as part of the integrated project. The reflections from the students, the findings from the survey and the evaluation of the students\u2019 outputs, suggested that though they enjoyed the activity, it was a challenging and a complex task, which in turn provoked their thoughts, creativity and made them acquired teamwork skills.", "Flipped classroom with cooperative learning as a cornerstone ": "This article discusses the reasons for flipping a classroom in an Engineering course and for including cooperative learning, supported by the literature. The case study then notes the challenges in changing the teaching mode, for example, in building front-loaded resources, and in coaxing students into using them. Bloom\u2019s taxonomy enables constructive alignment, adding a significant third pedagogic adjustment. Evidence from students shows what worked and what didn\u2019t. Findings were likely to alert other lecturers attempting greater student engagement to what is entailed and to the commonality of time-expense when improving learning outcomes. Then student feedback on the learning experience was analysed to show their perspective on the changes, and to be used to fine-tune the course for a second cycle of action research. The results showed that flipped classroom helped to develop and improve students\u2019 learning and critical analysis skills. Furthermore, cooperative learning improved students\u2019 communication skills and enabled them to build their teamwork and problem-solving skills. More than 90% of students agreed that flipped classroom with cooperative learning enabled them to extend their skills. Nonetheless, we show how much work is required to achieve this, and what pitfalls lie in the way.", "Psychrometric charts in color: An example of active learning for chemical engineering students and faculty members ": "This paper reports the design and scale-up of an active learning exercise centered around color coding of psychrometric charts. The initial version of this exercise was used with small classes of 60 students. When the class size doubled to 120 students, the previously successful exercise failed. The failure was then used as a workshop example for faculty development. Workshop participants successfully identified a number of details of planning and implementation which could be improved, and the revised exercise was once again successful in the classroom. The results are a framework for design of active learning exercises, a number of lessons learned about how to successfully implement active learning in large classes, and a highly polished 2-lecture unit on psychrometric charts, including two animated and worked examples which form part of the paper.", "Chemical engineering in an unsustainable world: Obligations and opportunities ": "Human society faces a set of unprecedented challenges emanating from the unsustainable nature of the current societal model. The creation of a new sustainable societal construct is required, essentially adopting a needs based approach over one based on ever increasing consumption. Failure to achieve this will result in the widespread destruction of our increasingly stressed environment followed quickly by inevitable collapse of society as we know it, both socially and economically.\n                  Technology alone is insufficient to meet the challenges at hand; ecological, social and economic considerations must be incorporated through a multi-faceted and multi-disciplinary approach. Because chemical engineers possess a core set of threshold concepts which are central to a sustainable society, and because engineers will ultimately help design any new society, they bear a moral and ethical responsibility to play an active and indeed central role in its development. A new engineering paradigm is required therefore, whereby sustainability becomes the context of engineering practice. To achieve this, a sustainability informed ethos must prevail throughout engineering curricula. Both professional institutions and educators bear responsibility in ensuring this happens without delay. Some key threshold concepts are presented here to demonstrate how this can be advanced through the chemical engineering curriculum.", "Assessing the performance of UK universities in the field of chemical engineering using data envelopment analysis ": "University rankings have become an important tool to compare academic institutions within and across countries. Yet, they rely on aggregated scores based on subjective weights which render them sensitive to experts\u2019 preferences and not fully transparent to final users. To overcome this limitation, we apply Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate UK universities in the field of chemical engineering as a case study, using data retrieved from two national rankings. DEA is a non-parametric approach developed for the multi-criteria assessment of entities that avoids the use of subjective weightings and aggregated scores; this is accomplished by calculating an efficiency index, on the basis of which universities can be classified as either \u2018efficient\u2019 or \u2018inefficient\u2019. Our analysis shows that the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) occupying the highest positions in the chemical engineering rankings might not be the most efficient ones, and vice versa, which highlights the need to complement the use of rankings with other analytical tools. Overall, DEA provides further insight into the assessment of HEIs, allowing institutions to better understand their weaknesses and strengths, while pinpointing sources of inefficiencies where improvement efforts must be directed.", "Potential impact on the recruitment of chemical engineering graduates due to the industrial internship ": "Preparing, finding and making the transition from a Bachelor degree level to a successful job in the profession of Chemical Engineering requires not only an investment of time and effort but also prior training in a work placement environment, which allows the development and strengthening of the professional skills of the future graduates. A central aspect of this process is the ongoing consideration of an industrial internship to take advantage of the goals, strengths and opportunities that such alternative offers to undergraduate students. The Industrial Internship Program of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Universidade de Santiago de Compostela prepares third- and fourth-year college students to successfully integrate and thrive in the professional world and to have their first experience in a real-life work context, supported by a dynamic community of administrative and teaching staff and employers. Companies that collaborate in the training of future chemical engineers are distributed throughout the national territory, which allows a strong connection with the socioeconomic environment.", "A successful experience with the flipped classroom in the Transport Phenomena course ": "Transport Phenomena is a core subject in Chemical Engineering studies. Its fundamentals need significant effort to be understood. Furthermore, students must apply theory to solve practical engineering problems, and it is usually problem resolution which has the largest weight in course assessment. However, due to the high amount of theory that must be covered in Transport Phenomena courses, usually little classroom time is reserved for practice and problem-solving skills are not worked in class. This constitutes a serious misalignment between learning activities, expected outcomes and evaluation. In this article, we propose the flipped classroom as a suitable methodology to solve this issue. As a pilot study, we flipped one unit of the Transport Phenomena course of the Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Chemical Engineering. Theory was provided through whiteboard animated video before the classroom sessions. Classroom time was mainly dedicated to participative discussion and problem solving in small groups. Satisfaction questionnaires were used to monitor student perception of learning quality before and after the methodology update. Student judgement on the interest of the subject and the value of the learnt concepts boosted about 20% on average with the flipped classroom. Around 70% of the surveyed students reported that the new methodology increased their motivation and that it helped them to learn both theory and practice. These results indicate that the flipped classroom is suitable for highly-technical classes with a large amount of complex theory, and it helps in the understanding and application of such theory.", "Programming skills in the industry 4.0: are chemical engineering students able to face new problems? ": "A reflection on teaching programming at undergraduate level using advanced tools is presented. Advanced digital tools and computational evolution have shaped different areas, such as industrial process, communications, education and innovation. New technologies, such as the Internet of Things-IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, have boosted software development and computational skills in different areas. The chemical engineering knowledge acquired by senior students and programming skills can be integrated to develop computational tools, favoring chemical engineers to take advantage of new opportunities in digital area. Normally, programming courses are offered at the beginning of chemical engineering program, with examples not related to chemical engineering problems. To fill this gap, an elective discipline was created for final year undergraduate students in the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil). This paper discusses the main motivations for a new programming course, presents the structure of the course and shows some outcomes from a students' survey about what they have learned.", "Learning by doing: Chem-E-Car\u00ae motivating experience ": "Since 2013 a group of professors from the Chemical Engineering Department of Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) has implemented a teaching tool based on the concept of \u201clearning by doing\u201d that has been successfully used in the US to increase motivation of students. This tool consists of a competition, called Chem-E-Car\u00ae, which helps to teach not only specific, but also transversal competences of the undergraduate students. They have to design, build and move a car controlled by a chemical reaction that it has to travel a specified distance while carrying a certain amount of water.\n                  The Chem-E-Car\u00ae World Competition took place at the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering, in 2017, and the students\u2019team from UCM presented a Chem-E-Car\u00ae moved by a battery based on an oxidation-reduction reaction and stopped by means of an iodine timer. It has been the first time that UCM has competed and the first time that the competition has taken place in Spain.\n                  Chem-E-Car\u00ae has contributed to develop both the application of Chemical Engineering knowledge and professional skills. Chem-E-Car\u00ae project has allowed the students to incorporate new abilities, such as team-working, leading, facing personal and professional troubles, interpreting and applying rules, project management and safety hazards.", "Applying PBL methodologies to the chemical engineering courses: Unit operations and modeling and simulation, using a joint course project ": "Unit Operations and Modelling and Simulation have been for long time a staple of the academic formation of any chemical engineer. Both are integral to the analysis of any chemical process, discretizing it into smaller specific processes that can then be characterized and modelled through the solution of balance, thermodynamics and transport equations. However, students usually perceive these subjects as separate fields of knowledge, and they do not develop the ability to correlate and integrate them to solve real-world problems in their future profession. On account of this, a Project-Based Learning (PBL) methodology was proposed in the redesign of the abovementioned undergraduate courses, focusing initially in Unit Operations. This PBL method was implemented alongside a joint course project, consisting on the design, assembly and characterization of a centrifugal pump, to be analyzed experimentally and computationally. To assess the success of this methodology, a survey was conducted on the students after they finished their courses. The results were mostly positive (85%), as the students appreciated the design component of the project, considering that it benefits their learning process, as well as the challenge it presented. This difficulty forced them to resort to different sources of information and areas of knowledge, alien to those provided in the courses. The limitations of the chosen project revolved around its limited scope and lack of connection with other topics of the courses (i.e. distillation columns). These limitations will be addressed with the design of transversal projects, which can cover more of the subjects seen in both classes.", "Developing a framework for assessing teaching effectiveness in higher education ": "Evaluating the effectiveness of teaching and learning core knowledge outcomes and professional skills is a highly challenging task that has not yet been satisfactorily addressed at higher education level. The iTeach European project consortium developed a framework for assessing the effectiveness of various pedagogical methodologies in chemical engineering education, including those aiming to promote important core competencies related to employability, in a range of geographical and educational contexts.\n                  The framework was firstly implemented in a core chemical engineering area (reaction engineering) to check its usability and robustness, and subsequently was also tested on a range of subject areas from various branches of engineering and other disciplines, one of which is analysed in more detail in this contribution. The results of this broader assessment encompassed a much more diverse student body with varying educational experiences and a wider range of different teaching methodologies. The outcomes of this assessment are highlighted and the benefits of such an objective approach for evaluating teaching effectiveness is discussed.", "Reprint of: Education of chemical engineering in Spain: A global picture ": "The general framework of the Chemical Engineering studies in Spain includes the Bachelor's Degree (4 years), Master's Degree (the most common duration is 1.5 years) and Doctorate (3-4 years). In 2008, the Conference of Directors and Deans of Chemical Engineering (CODDIQ) was constituted with the main objective of promoting and improving the quality of Chemical Engineering studies in Spain. Currently, Faculties and Schools of 29 Spanish universities are members of CODDIQ. An analysis of the most characteristic indicators provides a representative radiography of the Chemical Engineering Studies in Spain, whose most outstanding data are: (i) 7,396 undergraduate students, 1,014 Master students and 556 PhD students, (ii) according to the gender profile of undergraduates and graduates, the percentage of women is similar to that of men, while for faculty staff, the percentage of women is 43% and 46% for Associate and Assistant Professor (respectively) and 23% for the category of Full Professor category; (iii) after completing the Bachelor studies, most of them continue their training in the MSc in Chemical Engineering, (iv) the employability after obtaining the Master's degree is very high (>75%), which in the case of PhDs is close to 100%. The studies of Chemical Engineering in Spain have a very direct relationship with society, especially in the chemical, environmental, biotechnological and energy fields. The companies that collaborate in the training of future professionals are distributed throughout the national territory, which allows a strong connection with the socioeconomic environment.", "Professional design of chemical plants based on problem-based learning on a pilot plant ": "This work describes a novel teaching methodology and its application in a subject framed in the last course of the master\u2019s degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Seville. The main aim consists of promoting a way to facilitate professional practice in this field to the students. Authors also aim at guiding the transition to the new learning requirements demanded by the European Higher Education Area (EHEA).\n                  The novel methodology is based on the development of a detailed design of a pilot plant that can be further evaluated by the students themselves. Students are also allowed to run experiments at the facility and carry out several standard tests to verify the quality of the results of their works. The novelty of this proposal consists of incorporating a real installation available in our department to drive new learning methodologies applied in Chemical Engineering curricula. The methodology is distributed across several tasks: training (self-learning), project execution and supervision, comparison with a real installation and pilot plant experiences. The application of the proposed teaching methodology provided quality didactic material production, high satisfaction of the students with the new learning approach and the fact that they gained practical experience at industrial scale.", "New chemical engineering provision: Quality in diversity ": "Recent growth in chemical engineering student numbers has driven an increase in the number of UK universities offering the subject. The implications of this growth are described, along with the different challenges facing new providers in the UK compared with established departments. The approaches taken by the various new entrants are reviewed, with reference to recruitment strategies, infrastructure, the use of external facilities, and the particular flavours of chemical engineering being offered by the new providers. Information about the differentiating features of the large number of chemical engineering degree courses now available is somewhat indistinct: this should be rectified in the interests both of prospective students and of employers. Dilemmas facing new providers include the need to address the fundamentals of the subject as well as moving into more novel research-led areas; enabling students to develop the competencies to sustain them for a whole career as well as meeting immediate employer needs; and providing sufficient industry understanding when academics may lack substantial industrial experience. The central importance of practical provision and of the design project, and the approaches taken by new providers to deliver these components, are reviewed, together with the role of software tools in chemical engineering education, and measures to facilitate industry input into courses. As long as it is not used prescriptively or to inhibit innovation, the accreditation process provides constructive guidance and leverage for universities developing new chemical engineering programmes.", "Development and application of scoring rubrics for evaluating students\u2019 competencies and learning outcomes in Chemical Engineering experimental courses ": "This paper reflects on the interest of several teachers in reviewing the instruments and evaluation processes in Chemical Engineering experimental courses taught during three consecutive academic years at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid: Engineering Laboratory, Experimentation in Chemical Engineering and Process Scale-up.\n                  In this study, a methodology has been proposed to design, develop, and apply rubrics based on competence and learning outcome approaches. Thanks to the collaborative work of the three teaching teams involved, the application of comprehensive rubrics to provide gradual attainment of competence and formative evaluation over the academic years was rendered possible.\n                  Rubrics were developed to evaluate the main tasks of the courses: Personal Work, Written Report, and Oral Presentation. The rubric for each task contained the same evaluation criteria and dimensions with four levels of achievement, but differed in the scoring strategy depending on the course in which the rubric was implemented.\n                  The use of evaluation rubrics had a low impact on the final students\u2019 grade; its greatest impact was on Personal Work, as a larger number of students achieved higher scores. The rubrics fostered transparency in the evaluation process of the students and homogenized the evaluation criteria for a large number of teachers (22) and students (180 per year).", "\n               KBR (Kinetics in Batch Reactors): a MATLAB-based application with a friendly Graphical User Interface for chemical kinetic model simulation and parameter estimation ": "The simulation of chemical kinetic models is necessary in order to analyze comprehensive chemical reaction mechanisms and perform the estimation of the kinetic parameters. In many cases, a chemical process can be composed of several series and/or independent reactions that requires a complex set of kinetic equations to be solved. Computer-based tools for the study of kinetics of chemical reaction networks have been used since the last 50 years. However, the educational tools in this field should be friendly for the user and easy to learn and adapt to practical cases, avoiding long frustrating learning curves. Herein, the main objective of this contribution is to present a Matlab\u00ae application for the evaluation of Kinetics in Batch Reactors (KBR), which will help students to estimate kinetic parameters of complex chemical reaction models. The KBR application was used in the Final Degree Projects of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Engineering Degrees at Rey Juan Carlos University (Spain). This application provides a friendly Graphical User Interface to formulate any kind of kinetic model for subsequent simulation in order to monitor the evolution of reagents and products along the reaction time. Moreover, the student will be able to estimate kinetic parameters according to available experimental data as well as to apply sensitivity analysis of those parameters for particular cases of chemical reactions in batch systems. Finally, the results can be exported for further analysis as a spreadsheet of an Excel\u00ae file (.xlsx).", "Incorporating life cycle assessment and ecodesign tools for green chemical engineering: A case study of competences and learning outcomes assessment ": "Chemical engineers assume a broad range of roles in industry, spanning the development of new process designs, the maintenance and optimization of complex systems, and the production of intermediate materials, final products and new technologies. The technical aptitude that enables chemical engineers to fulfill these various roles along the value chain makes them compelling participants in the environmental assessment of the product in question. Therefore, the introduction of life cycle assessment (LCA) and ecodesign concepts into the chemical engineering curriculum is essential to help these future professionals to face design problems with a holistic view of the technical, economic, social and environmental impacts of their solutions. The teaching of these and other disciplines by means of student-centered methods, based on a holistic structure, have demonstrated better teamwork and communication skills. For that reason, this paper proposes a Micro (Assess-Analyze-Act) (M-3A) model of assessment mainly focused on closing the loop of the learning activities. This model has been applied to an ecodesign case study of the \u201cUniversity master\u2019s Degree in chemical engineering\u201d of the University of Cantabria/University of the Basque Country, with positive feedback of the students. They felt that the approach has allowed them to utilize their analytical skills in quantifying a situation before applying other subjective measures, and that the public discussion of the results was a satisfactory element for improving their communication skills. Moreover, the students found that the workload was nicely adjusted, highlighting the acquisition of 4 competences preferentially: teamwork, creativity; relevance of environmental issues and initiative and entrepreneurship. Finally, the students suggest that the application of this methodology into their degree could motivate future students improving their performance.", "A framework for hands-on learning in chemical engineering education\u2014Training students with the end goal in mind ": "Chemical engineering education aims to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and hands-on capability to solve practical problems. At Imperial College London, this is practiced via three laboratory-based courses, which span over the first three years of the undergraduate curriculum. The Foundation, Knowledge and Discovery Laboratories were designed based on Kolb\u2019s experiential learning theory as well as Vygotsky\u2019s zone of proximal development. Although these courses intend to challenge students, appropriate scaffolding is in place to ensure a satisfactory learning experience across the spectrum of abilities. Assessment and survey results show that all students were capable of meeting the learning goals (>96% achieving satisfactory to excellent results in academic years 2014\u20132016), while a large majority is satisfied with the courses (>80% in academic years 2014\u20132016). The design and implementation of these courses are discussed to promote the exchange of good practices within the higher education community.", "Learning-by-Doing: The Chem-E-Car Competition\u00ae in the University of Cantabria as case study ": "It is widely known that the Learning-by-Doing (LbD) pedagogical tool is not the most common form of education in Chemical Engineering nowadays. The aim of this work is to describe the application of LbD considering as case of study the participation of undergraduate students from the Chemical Engineering Degree of the University of Cantabria (UC) from Spain in the Chem-E-Car Competition\u00ae in the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering (WCCE10). The Chem-E-Car Competition\u00ae is a world-known student event run by AIChE, which provides chemical engineering undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in a team-oriented hands-on design and construction of a small prototype car powered by a chemical reaction. Within the context of the WCCE10, the competition gathered 18 teams from different countries all around the world. The UC team ended in the 6th position and won the award to the best inherent safety design. Overall, the benefits outpaced the time cost both for students and the teaching staff. This situation was not clear at the beginning of the project.\n                  Prior to this competition, LbD was used as an innovative pedagogical tool for the requested acquisition of competences. The proposal of a multi-annual Final Degree Programme was a win\u2013win situation for all the stakeholders. From a teaching point of view, the LbD let transferable and core competences to be evaluated not only internally, but also externally thanks to the competition. A survey was completed among the students that participated in the project. Competences such as \u201cProblem-solving\u201d and \u201cAdaptation to new situations\u201d were pointed out as those which were developed in a higher level by the students.", "Improving the internship experience in the master of chemical engineering at the University of Granada ": "The purpose of this paper is to analyze the present status of the internship program of Master of Chemical Engineering at the University of Granada and establish a systematic model to annually acquaint the satisfaction of students. It will allow the improvement of the internship program according to the opinions of students. The authors have examined a total of 33 items grouped in 7 different blocks. The results showed that the majority of students were satisfied with the internship program. Students recognized that the possibility of carrying out the internship abroad and improve the soft skills are some of the advantages of the internship offer of master\u2019s degree. In fact, most of them prolonged their training period in order to perform their final Master project in the research center where they had carried out their internship. Some aspects should be improved, namely the communication between the academic tutor and the students, the information and guidance in the internship selection or the proposal of practices in more varied sectors. The findings of the present study had let to propose improvements for the internship program.", "A homogeneous chemical reactor analysis and design laboratory: The reaction kinetics of dye and bleach ": "An experimental module for senior-level reaction engineering/reactor design students is described. The module is used to characterize the kinetics of dye (food coloring) neutralization by household bleach, and the reactor system is configurable for use in either batch reactor or continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) modes. The reactor temperature, volume, reactant feed rates, and reactant concentrations may be adjusted to enable students to obtain a wide range of kinetic data. Dye concentrations in the reactor are monitored by absorbance spectroscopy, and the kinetic rate law is determined directly from the batch reactor performance data. Students use the completed kinetic rate law to compare experimental steady-state CSTR performance data to the mathematical models derived from reactor design equations. Finally, the students use the kinetic behavior of the system to design a hypothetical plug-flow reactor for the same chemical reaction and a set of stated operational goals.", "Learning distillation by a combined experimental and simulation approach in a three steps laboratory: Vapor pressure, vapor-liquid equilibria and distillation column ": "Distillation is one of the most important separation process in industrial chemistry. This operation is based on a deep knowledge of the fluid phase equilibria involved in the mixture to be separated. In particular, the most important aspects are the determination of the vapor pressures of the single compounds and the correct representation of the eventual not ideality of the mixture. Simulation science is a fundamental tool for managing these complex topics and chemical engineers students have to learn and to use it on real case-studies. To give to the students a complete overview of these complex aspects, a laboratory experience is proposed. Three different work stations were set up: i) determination of vapor pressure of two pure compounds; ii) the study of vapor-liquid equilibria of a binary mixture; iii) the use of a continuous multistage distillation column in dynamic and steady-state conditions. The simulation of all these activities by a commercial software, PRO II by AVEVA, allows to propose and verify the thermodynamic characteristics of the mixture and to correctly interpret the distillation column data. Moreover, the experimental plants and the data elaboration by classical equations are presented. The students are request to prepare a final report in which the description of the experimental plants and experimental procedure, the interpretation of the results and the simulation study are critically discussed in order to encourage them to reason and to acquire the concepts of the course.\n                  Two different questionnaires each with 7 questions, for the course and for the laboratory, are proposed and analyzed. The final evaluation of the students was strongly positive both for the course as a whole and for the proposed laboratory activities.", "The energy requirements of a developed world ": "Through history, special attention has been paid to the study of the relationship between the energy use of a country and its level of development. While the interest of this research area is unquestionable, the energy indicators commonly used (e.g. total primary energy) are problematic. In the current context of globalization, the energy used by a country is not anymore a suitable indicator for measuring the total energy requirements associated with its level of development; the significant variable is the energy consumed worldwide to produce the goods and services demanded by that country, i.e. its energy footprint. In this study, we compare the human development index of 40 countries with their total primary energy demand and total primary energy footprint for the period 1995\u20132008. The results show that the total primary energy demand underestimates the energy required to maintain a high level of development, since a significant part of the energy used by emerging countries is being increasingly devoted to sustain the welfare of developed countries by means of international trade. We also find that the minimum total primary energy footprint per capita to achieve a high level of development is 33% higher than current world's per capita energy use.", "Clean cooking and the SDGs: Integrated analytical approaches to guide energy interventions for health and environment goals ": "Development and implementation of clean cooking technology for households in low and middle income countries (LMICs) offer enormous promise to advance at least five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 3. Good health and well-being; 5. Gender equality; 7. Affordable and clean energy; 13. Climate action; 15. Life on land. Programs are being implemented around the world to introduce alternative cooking technologies, and we are well on the way to achieving the goal set by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to reach 100 million homes with cleaner and more efficient cooking methods by 2020. Despite evidence that household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel combustion is responsible for 3\u20134 million early deaths per year, many cookstove programs are motivated and/or financed by climate change mitigation schemes and deploy alternative stoves that use solid fuels such as wood and charcoal. However, recent studies have demonstrated that improved biomass-burning stoves typically only incrementally improve air quality and yield modest or minimal health benefits. Likewise, their contributions to climate change mitigation and other SDGs may be limited. Evidence indicates that cleaner fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol and biogas, offer greater potential benefits not only to health, but also greater progress towards climate goals and other relevant SDGs. We present a modeled estimate of these potential gains for a diverse group of 40 LMICs. Our model suggests that cookstove programs using LPG stoves and fuel will yield greater reductions in both Disability Adjusted Life Years and Global Warming Commitment in these countries than those using improved biomass stoves. Cost and infrastructure requirements for clean fuels such as LPG are widely recognized constraints. In view of these constraints we present an analytical method to simultaneously consider health and climate needs at the national level for the same 40 countries in the context of estimated LPG expansion potentials. Comparative analyses integrating priorities across SDGs at the national and regional levels may guide more practical and effective household energy development choices going forward.", "Forecasting Indonesia's electricity load through 2030 and peak demand reductions from appliance and lighting efficiency ": "Indonesia's electricity demand is growing rapidly, driven by robust economic growth combined with unprecedented urbanization and industrialization. Energy-efficiency improvements could reduce the country's electricity demand, thus providing monetary savings, greenhouse gas and other pollutant reductions, and improved energy security. Perhaps most importantly, using energy efficiency to lower peak electricity demand could reduce the risk of economically damaging power shortages while freeing up funds that would otherwise be used for power plant construction. We use a novel bottom-up modeling approach to analyze the potential of energy efficiency to reduce Indonesia's electricity demand: the LOAD curve Model (LOADM) combines total national electricity demand for each end use\u2014as modeled by the Bottom-Up Energy Analysis System (BUENAS)\u2014with hourly end-use demand profiles. We find that Indonesia's peak demand may triple between 2010 and 2030 in a business-as-usual case, to 77.3\u202fGW, primarily driven by air conditioning and with important contributions from lighting and refrigerators. However, we also show that appliance and lighting efficiency improvements could hold the peak demand increase to a factor of two, which would avoid 26.5\u202fGW of peak demand in 2030. These results suggest that well-understood programs, such as minimum efficiency performance standards, could save Indonesia tens of billions of dollars in capital costs over the next decade and a half.", "An analysis of efforts to scale up clean household energy for cooking around the world ": "Approximately 3 billion people, most of whom live in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, rely on solid fuels (i.e. wood, crop wastes, dung, charcoal) and kerosene for their cooking needs. Exposure to household air pollution from burning these fuels is estimated to account for approximately 3 million premature deaths a year. Cleaner fuels \u2013 such as liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, electricity, and certain compressed biomass fuels \u2013 have the potential to alleviate much of this significant health burden. A wide variety of clean cooking intervention programs are being implemented around the world, but very few of these efforts have been analyzed to enable global learning. The Clean Cooking Implementation Science Network (ISN), supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and partners, identified the need to augment the publicly available literature concerning what has worked well and in what context. The ISN has supported the development of a systematic set of case studies, contained in this Special Issue, examining clean cooking program rollouts in a variety of low- and middle-income settings around the world. We used the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adaptation, implementation, maintenance) framework to coordinate and evaluate the case studies. This paper describes the clean cooking case studies project, introduces the individual studies contained herein, and proposes a general conceptual model to support future planning and evaluation of household energy programs.", "Ghana's rural liquefied petroleum gas program scale up: A case study ": "Background\n                  The Government of Ghana launched the Rural LPG (RLP) promotion program in 2013 as part of its efforts to reduce fuelwood consumption. The aim of the RLP is to contribute to Ghana's overarching goal to provide LPG access to 50% of Ghana's population by 2020. The RLP has not announced long-term program objectives. However, in the interim the RLP targeted a cumulative total of 170,000 LPG cookstoves to rural households by the end of 2017. As of November 2017, 149,500 rural households had received the LPG cook stoves. Our case study documents Ghana's experiences to date with LPG scale up.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  We carried out a desktop review/document analysis of literature on the RLP. Each document was reviewed for information related to the elements of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework as it pertained to LPG promotion and adoption. In-depth interviews were held among key stakeholders in Ghana. Previously collected data from a field evaluation of the RLP was also assessed.\n               \n               \n                  Findings\n                  Generally, our evaluation suggests that the current form of the RLP is not achieving its stated goal. Our evaluation of the RLP in five rural communities showed that about 58% of households had never refilled their LPG cylinders nine months after the initial delivery of a filled cylinder. Only 8% still used their LPG at 18\u202fmonths post distribution. Cost and distance to LPG filling stations were the main reasons for low LPG use. Beneficiaries did not exclusively use their LPG even at the initial stages when all of them had LPG in their cylinders. Ghana is currently undergoing transitions in the LPG sector including a change from the current private cylinder ownership model to a cylinder recirculation model for the distribution of LPG. There was no evidence of a well-documented implementation framework for the RLP.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Fuel cost, poor LPG access, and an inadequate implementation framework hinder the RLP implementation.", "The Mega Conversion Program from kerosene to LPG in Indonesia: Lessons learned and recommendations for future clean cooking energy expansion ": "Background\n                  In 2007, the Indonesian Government instigated a national program to convert domestic kerosene users to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking. This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies.\n               \n               \n                  Objective\n                  To review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP).\n               \n               \n                  Methods and data sources\n                  Searches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys. The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia. Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used. Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015. Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households. While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Addressing HAP and the health impacts associated with kerosene and biomass use was never an objective of the program. Consequently, there is limited evidence of impact in this area, and in hindsight, missed opportunities in terms of influencing cooking behaviour change among biomass users, who are more at risk.", "Africa Biogas Partnership Program: A review of clean cooking implementation through market development in East Africa ": "This paper analyses the Africa Biogas Partnership Program (ABPP) in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. ABPP was established in 2009 to promote adoption of biodigesters by rural households in sub-Saharan Africa. We use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) with information from literature, internal documents, primary data from user surveys and interviews with sector stakeholders.\n                  ABPP was implemented with the primary objective of establishing viable biodigester markets. By 2017, Kenya made most progress toward commercial viability, evidenced by market entry of companies offering prefabricated digesters and establishment of 22 marketing hubs, which link rural organizations with local construction enterprises and finance institutions. In Uganda 5 marketing hubs were established and in Tanzania 7. Between 2009 and 2017 over 27,000 households installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. Additional objectives include improving agricultural productivity by using bio-slurry, improving health, reducing deforestation, and improving livelihoods.\n                  Households perceive higher crop yields (84%\u201391% of users), reduced fuel consumption (84%\u201394% of users), reduced eye problems and respiratory symptoms (45%\u201391% of users). Benefits most appreciated are \u201ceasy cooking\u201d and \u201csaving time and money\u201d. Fuel consumption tests show households with biodigesters use 2.1 to 3.3 fewer tons of wood per year than similar households without biodigesters.\n                  The ABPP case study suggests that the program has created a nascent biodigester market in East Africa. The country programs have been dynamic and adaptive, moving along the cycle of market development; however, many challenges remain. For example, while half of the adopters in Kenya exclusively use biogas for cooking, in Uganda and Tanzania fuel stacking is more prevalent, making it more difficult to achieve health and environmental objectives. In addition, high upfront cost, limited access to credit, and lack of maintenance present challenges. In 2016, 27% of biodigesters constructed between 2009 and 2013 were not working. In response, ABPP implemented call centers and launched campaigns to repair non-functioning plants. To ensure long-term viability and increase the likelihood of achieving environmental and health goals, we suggest deeper engagement with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and a targeted campaign promoting exclusive use.", "Implementation and scale-up of a biomass pellet and improved cookstove enterprise in Rwanda ": "This paper reviews the experience of a for-profit firm in Rwanda promoting biomass pellets and a fan micro-gasification improved cookstove as a clean cooking alternative to charcoal. Consumers purchase locally produced biomass pellets and receive the improved cookstove on a lease basis. The cost of the pellets and stove(s) is lower than the cost of cooking with charcoal in the urban setting where our study takes place. Inyenyeri has been piloting its business model since 2012. Using data from an ongoing quantitative impact evaluation study, focus group discussions, and a series of key informant interviews, we chronicle the firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production, and marketing, highlighting lessons for the design of private sector-led clean cooking interventions.\n                  We find that 38% of households marketed to as part of our ongoing impact evaluation study adopted the pellet and stove system, but that approximately 45% of those who adopted suspended contracts after signing up. The firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production, pricing structures, and customer service strategies have influenced implementation, adoption rates, and scale-up. Customer preferences for specific stove attributes and willingness of stove manufacturers to modify stoves for local conditions have influenced both the firm's choice of stove and customer satisfaction. In 2015 the firm transitioned customers from the Philips stove to the Mimi Moto, a decision which created confusion among consumers, and affected adoption rates. Despite the challenge of establishing and scaling-up pellet production in central Africa, the firm increased production 400% between 2014 and 2017 to reach 800,000\u202fkg/year. Importing and maintaining pelletizing equipment in Rwanda is costly, the supply of feedstock irregualar, and undercapitalization of the firm have affected production. With respect to marketing, after experimenting with a sign-up fee and a minimum monthly purchase of pellets, the firm has decided to transition to a pay-as-you-go system to reduce perceived risk by consumers. A high-level of customer service including in-home visits, free in-home repair, and home delivery of pellets are major innovations. The long pilot phase and the evolutionary nature of the firm's activities illustrate both the complexity of building a market for clean cooking, and the time required to understand nascent markets and consumer demand.", "Barriers to Large-scale Solar Power in Tanzania ": "The Tanzanian official power system expansion plan shows a dominant dependence on fossil fuel-fired power plants till 2040. Hence identifying and analysing the underlying barriers for the deployment of large-scale renewables are essential. This study investigates the barriers to large-scale solar power in Tanzania. Key institutional, financial, and technological barriers are identified at different levels. The study uses a qualitative methodology where primary data is collected through 30 semi-structured interviews with experts representing the main electricity sector's stakeholders from public institutions, research institutions, private investors, civil society organizations, development partners, and financial institutions. A stakeholder-based approach which emphasizes the different perceptions of the stakeholder's groups is used to identify the barriers. Institutional barriers for the diffusion of large-scale solar power technologies are found to be predominant, and they often trigger financial and technological barriers. The study consolidates the view that foreign investment and aid directed to expand electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa need to be reshaped in order to be a driving force towards sustainable energy transition in the region. The study argues for the possibility to work on the compatible interests between the pro-renewables development partners and the Tanzanian government (which considers expanding electrification as a political priority) through introducing large-scale solar power projects that help in expanding electrification while being technically and financially supported by the development partners.", "Rural electrification, electrification inequality and democratic institutions in sub-Saharan Africa ": "While it is commonly believed that democracy influences public service provision, comparably few studies have assessed how recent democratisation in developing countries has impacted tangible public service outcomes for economically deprived population shares. Using panel data from 46 sub-Saharan African countries between 1990 and 2010 as well as qualitative country case examples from Ghana, Swaziland, Uganda, Senegal and Rwanda, this paper examines considerable and growing rural electrification variations in terms of political, economic and demographic variables. The analyses suggest that democracy is strongly associated with rural electrification increases and rural versus urban electrification inequality decreases in sub-Saharan Africa. This result is robust to a variety of political, economic and demographic control variables as well as different econometric modelling assumptions. The paper further presents novel multi-variant evidence supporting that contested elections with strong oppositions as well as effective policy implementing institutions may act as intervening institutional mechanisms that explain a part of democracy's association with rural electricity provision. Higher income per capita, national savings and population densities may further foster rural electrification, while high foreign aid shares of GDP and rural population percentages may pose challenges to access equality.", "Anaerobic digestion of undiluted simulant human excreta for sanitation and energy recovery in less-developed countries ": "Improving access to sanitation is one of the most effective means to improve public health. Anaerobic digestion of high-strength undiluted human simulant excreta was investigated in laboratory systems. The focus was on demonstrating the suitability of using simple unmixed anaerobic digesters for the treatment of a simulant high-strength undiluted human excreta and to quantify the effects of high ammonia concentration on the biogas yield. A maximum biogas yield of 0.44NLbiogas\n                     g\u22121\n                     COD was obtained in batch experiments, while yields of 0.38 and 0.24NLbiogas\n                     g\u22121\n                     COD were obtained at 5 and 8g total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) L\u22121, respectively. Using an inoculum acclimated to high ammonia concentrations was critical to successful biogas production at these high TAN concentrations. Stable long-term anaerobic digestion of simulant human excreta at ammonia concentrations ranging from 5.20 to 7.15g-NL\u22121 was obtained in a scaled-down mimic of a low cost floating dome anaerobic digester. Overall, the results demonstrate that anaerobic digestion of undiluted human simulant excreta in simple unmixed digesters is feasible and yields biogas, which is a valuable commodity. When combined with proper hygienization of its effluent, anaerobic digestion could contribute to effective sanitation in developing countries with limited water availability.", "Pay-As-You-Go financing: A model for viable and widespread deployment of solar home systems in rural India ": "Decentralised Solar Home Systems (SHSs) are established as an effective strategy to connect the \u2018last mile\u2019 without electricity access and leapfrog communities to clean energy solutions. According to the World Bank, the Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model has emerged as one of the effective commercially viable solutions to provide decentralised energy access to rural and remote communities in developing nations. The paying ability of households is a critical challenge for energy enterprises, and PAYG, with its easy payment schemes makes solar units affordable and allows households to gradually own these systems. The model also offers user training, ongoing maintenance, and service blocking functionality that minimises investment risk. The PAYG model has demonstrated huge success in Sub-Saharan Africa where Kenya pioneered the model as a cost competitive modern alternative for kerosene. One in five people in India lack access to electricity, and grid-connected rural communities often face frequent blackouts. With the advancement in distributed solar technologies and growing penetration of the mobile telecommunications network in India, PAYG could advance into a successful model to electrify communities living off the grid. Our analysis involves a two-dimensional approach where a systematic review of PAYG literature including case studies from Kenya and India was performed, followed by three expert interviews to further augment learnings and opportunities to deploy PAYG SHSs in India. This analysis finds that India's socio-political context seems suited for increased PAYG penetration, including utilising the opportunity provided by the country's Unified Payments Interface. This paper offers insights for practitioners and policymakers to consider the PAYG model to deploy clean electricity to households and rural micro-enterprises.", "Why do farmers abandon jatropha cultivation? The case of Chiapas, Mexico ": "The biofuel crop Jatropha curcas has been promoted in developing countries as a means of improving the livelihoods of rural populations. In Mexico, despite the initially assumed economic, environmental, and social benefits of the crop, many farmers have abandoned jatropha cultivation. Here, we analyse the factors that influence farmers' decision to abandon jatropha cultivation by using a generalized linear modelling approach in combination with qualitative research methods. The deterioration in perception of jatropha profitability, the non-payment of expected subsidies and the wealth position of the household played a major role in determining abandonment. The perception of pest and disease damage, although stated by farmers as the second most frequent reason to disadopt, was not correlated with this decision in the generalized linear model. This research might help energy policy makers in identifying key elements to prevent failure of promotion programmes. The result of this study also may be useful for an international audience to reflect on the appropriateness of promoting a new crop at the farmer level before realistically evaluating the economic viability of its cultivation.", "A case study of the ethanol CleanCook stove intervention and potential scale-up in Ethiopia ": "Background\n                  Approximately 80% of Ethiopia's energy consumption is dominated by woody biomass fuel use, resulting in 91.2\u202fmillion\u202ftons of firewood and 4.2\u202fmillion\u202ftons of charcoal consumed annually. Ethiopia's dependency on non-sustainable energy, especially for cooking, has been a major concern for the nation for the past 30\u202fyears, contributing to deforestation, climate change, and adverse human health impacts.\n               \n               \n                  Objectives\n                  Our objective was to document the work of Gaia Association and the implementation of the ethanol CleanCook stove in the refugee camp and urban settings of Ethiopia. We then assessed the potential for the scale-up of ethanol as a household fuel.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  We utilized the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the ethanol cookstove intervention. We obtained secondary data from a variety of sources to evaluate a.) The performance of the CleanCook ethanol stove; b.) Effectiveness of the ethanol cookstove implementation; and, c.) Barriers to scale-up and commercialization of ethanol use as a household fuel. In addition, we conducted primary analysis of qualitative surveys to evaluate the perceptions of the ethanol and adoption of the CleanCook stove.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Our case study results provide critical insight into the 13-year implementation of the CleanCook ethanol stove in Ethiopia. Laboratory tests demonstrate that the CleanCook stove reduces harmful emissions compared to biomass stoves, and preliminary field tests show 24-hour average PM2.5 levels of 200\u202f\u03bcg/m3. To-date 8731 CleanCook stoves were distributed to refugee households, while an additional 500 were sold at a subsided price to low-income urban households. CleanCook stove users report the continued use of multiple stoves.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The CleanCook ethanol stove has been implemented as an energy intervention for the vulnerable refugee population in Ethiopia for over 13\u202fyears. There has been limited success of a subsidized CleanCook stove among low-income households in Addis Ababa. This case study demonstrates the complexities of promoting a new fuel for household cooking, and the numerous obstacles and stagnations in implementation. Ethanol demonstrates some potential for scale-up and commercialization as a household fuel in Addis Ababa, but it may require simultaneous stabilization of ethanol supply, growth of a city-wide distribution infrastructure, and an affordably priced stove and fuel.", "Comparison of load profiles in a mini-grid: Assessment of performance metrics using measured and interview-based data ": "Mini-grids are seen as an important option for increasing access to electricity in non-electrified rural areas where grid-extension is unfeasible. Appropriately dimensioning and constructing mini-grids requires knowledge of electricity usage. There is currently a lack of measured load profiles from mini-grids and the most common method for estimating electricity usage is through appliance data collected via interviews. Thus, this paper compares and investigates the differences between measured daily load profiles and daily load profiles created from appliance data collected through interviews and how the two methods impact the dimensioning and operation of a mini-grid. This is done by comparing load profiles for an entire mini-grid, a household and SME customers with large loads. The paper reports differing results from the two methodologies. Generally, the results show that the interview-based load profiles fail to provide an accurate overall estimate. The calculated performance metrics for the two methods also shows large differences. The interview-based load profiles mainly fail to provide accurate estimates of energy and the energy related (capacity factor and load factor) performance metrics. Accordingly, the implications for mini-grid operators and developers could be significant. The interview-based load profiles indicate the mini-grid system to be considerably less technically and economically desirable than measurements show. Suggestions for how the interview process can be improved are presented.", "Accuracy of energy-use surveys in predicting rural mini-grid user\u00a0consumption ": "Mini-grids for rural electrification in developing countries are growing in popularity but are not yet widely deployed. A key barrier of mini-grid proliferation is the uncertainty in predicting customer electricity consumption, which adds financial risk. Energy-use surveys deployed in the pre-feasibility stage that capture present and aspirational consumption are intended to reduce this uncertainty. However, the general reliability and accuracy of these surveys has not been demonstrated. This research compares survey-predicted electrical energy use to actual measured consumption of customers of eight mini-grids in rural Kenya. A follow-up audit compares the aspirational inventory of appliances to the realized inventory. The analysis shows that the ability to accurately estimate past consumption based on survey or audit data, even in a relatively short time-horizon is prone to appreciable error \u2014 a mean absolute error of 426Wh/day per customer on a mean consumption of 113Wh/day per customer. An alternative data-driven proxy village approach, which uses average customer consumption from each mini-grid to predict consumption at other mini-grids, was more accurate and reduced the mean absolute error to 75Wh/day per customer. Hourly load profiles were constructed to provide insight into potential causes of error and to suggest how the data provided in this work can be used in computer-aided mini-grid design programs.", "Estimation of demand diversity and daily demand profile for off-grid electrification in developing countries ": "The potential for small self-contained grid systems to provide electricity for currently unserved regions of the developing world is widely recognised. However planning and managing the electrical demand that will be supported, so that a mini-grid system is not overloaded and its available resource is used as fully as possible, is actually more difficult than for a large scale grid system. This paper discusses the mathematical reasons why this is the case, and describes a practical software tool for mini-grid demand estimation and planning that is complementary to the widely used HOMER software. This software tool is made available for download on an open source basis. Finally a conclusion is offered that mini-grid systems should aim to serve at least 50 households so that demand variability is more manageable and economies of scale can be realised.", "Energy access through electricity storage: Insights from technology providers and market enablers ": "In recent years, deployment of standalone electricity systems to provide energy access in a rural context has increased rapidly. These systems typically incorporating variable renewables alongside electrical energy storage for consistent supply, and operate at a range of scales to provide a range of services. However, there has been relatively little analysis of storage technology choices made by providers of these systems, how this varies by application, how these are influenced by priorities of providers, and how these choices could be improved. Here, we present findings from a series of interviews with providers of off grid energy solutions on choice and availability of technologies, supply chains, realised costs, technology performance, environmental impact, and anticipated impact of future technology development. Based upon these, we make recommendations for regulators and individual companies on how technology choices and life cycle management could be improved.", "Energy storage for mitigating the variability of renewable electricity sources: An updated review ": "Wind and solar power generation is growing quickly around the world, mainly to mitigate some of the negative environmental impacts of the electricity sector. However, the variability of these renewable sources of electricity poses technical and economical challenges when integrated on a large scale. Energy storage is being widely regarded as one of the potential solutions to deal with the variations of variable renewable electricity sources (VRES). This paper presents an up-to-date review of the state of technology, installations and some challenges of electrical energy storage (EES) systems. It particularly focuses on the applicability, advantages and disadvantages of various EES technologies for large-scale VRES integration. This survey paper indicates that each challenge imposed by VRES requires a different set of EES characteristics to address the issue, and that there is no single EES technology that consistently outperforms the others in various applications. This paper also discusses external factors, such as mineral availability and geographic limitations, that may affect the success of the widespread implementation of EES technologies.", "Development of renewable, densified biomass for household energy in China ": "Recent national strategic plans in China have set renewable energy targets for rural household energy programs, including those that advance the production of densified biomass fuels (e.g. pellets, briquettes) for use in household cooking and heating stoves. There is presently very little information on potential barriers to the successful development of densified biomass for household cooking and heating in China, but such knowledge may be informative in settings that aim to replace unprocessed coal and other polluting fuels with renewable, cleaner-burning energy sources. We designed a case study to coordinate data-gathering efforts at rural field sites in southwestern Sichuan province and northeastern Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, where production of densified biomass fuels is under development for household end-users. We conducted interviews with factory personnel, local administrative leaders, and sector experts involved in the production and distribution of densified fuel, including pellets and briquettes, for household use. Results from our qualitative textual data analysis yielded several recommendations for improving development of densified biomass fuels for household end-use. These included reducing heterogeneity of feedstocks, increasing financial support for operational costs (e.g. collection, transport, and storage of raw materials; storage and distribution of final products), improving household perceptions of and subsequent demand for densified biomass fuels, and increasing enforcement of national and provincial policies banning the use of coal and open-field biomass burning. Collection and storage of raw materials and the final densified fuel product were consistently noted as critical challenges to scaling up production at all three sites. Finally, the perspectives of factory managers and local village administrators that we present also indicated that production of densified biomass fuels would most likely be more successful and reproducible in places where national-level policies are viewed as obligatory.", "Government policy, clean fuel access, and persistent fuel stacking in Ecuador ": "After more than three decades of access to low-cost liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) financed by large direct government subsidies, >90% of Ecuadorian households cook primarily with LPG. Due to the large fiscal burden of the LPG subsidy, increases in electricity from hydropower, and other socio-political factors, the Government of Ecuador has launched a major induction stove program (PEC) to reduce the demand for LPG. We assess the effects of the LPG subsidies and PEC using government records, interviews, academic literature, newspaper reports, household surveys, and focus groups. Household surveys, conducted in rural, northern Ecuadorian households (n\u202f=\u202f383), characterized cooking patterns and fuel access. Focus groups (n\u202f=\u202f6) were carried out with a subset of surveyed households to better characterize survey findings. The LPG subsidy was developed as part of broad social support reforms in the early 1970s, without specific aims to reduce the health impacts of household air pollution from woodfuel or provide economic benefits as part of the transition to a clean cooking fuel. Nonetheless, the subsidy has resulted in nearly all Ecuadorian households cooking primarily with LPG. PEC has generated the sale of 740,000 induction stoves since its inception in 2014, short of the goal of 3.5 million. Among the rural households surveyed, LPG use, acceptance, and satisfaction was high, however, more than three-quarters of those surveyed reported weekly woodfuel use. Induction stove ownership (17%) and use as a primary cooking fuel (1%) was low among the rural households surveyed; furthermore, households owning induction stoves reported very low satisfaction with the stoves. Here we show that nationally-representative surveys reporting only \u201cprimary cooking fuel\u201d use may underestimate solid fuel use as a supplemental household cooking energy, particularly in rural areas where fuel availability issues play a stronger role in decisions about what fuels to use.", "Assessment of the Cambodian National Biodigester Program ": "The National Biodigester Program (NBP) was established in 2006 to build and maintain household biodigesters in Cambodia. In its first six years, the program installed almost 20,000 biodigesters and established an in-country network of local financiers, construction companies, skilled masons, bioslurry specialists and after-care technicians accessible to rural users in 14 of 24 Cambodian provinces. Since its initial success, the program's adoption rates have stalled despite increasing government support and high rates of user satisfaction. Building on an initial evaluation of the NBP in 2013, this updated assessment identifies multiple changes in its second implementation phase that have undermined the initial momentum of the program. Abrupt interruptions in institutional support, deteriorating supply side services (access to construction agents, masons, repair services) and reduced access to credit for farmers have eroded the service network that the first implementation phase established. Structural changes in the rural economy may also contribute to declining demand. Government support to another biodigester program which offers a lower investment price, but does not provide after-sales services, has also undercut the long-term implementation strategy of the NBP. The paper finds that despite these programmatic changes, the installed biodigesters continue to perform according to expectation and to be maintained and valued by their users, but the future viability of the program remains uncertain.", "The Government-led initiative for LPG scale-up in Cameroon: Programme development and initial evaluation ": "In 2016, the government of Cameroon, a central African country heavily reliant on wood fuel for cooking, published a Masterplan for increasing primary use of LPG from 20% to 58% of households by 2035. Developed via a multi-sectoral committee with support from the Global LPG Partnership, the plan envisages a 400 million Euro investment program to 2030, focused on increasing LPG cylinder numbers, key infrastructure, and enhanced regulation. This case study describes the Masterplan process and investment proposals and draws on community studies and stakeholder interviews to identify factors likely to impact on the planned expansion of LPG use.", "Livelihood diversification: The role of charcoal production in southern Malawi ": "Growing urban populations in Sub-Saharan Africa are increasing demand for charcoal. This paper presents a detailed case study of three communities supplying charcoal to Zomba, a medium-sized city in Southern Malawi. Using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to structure our analysis, we examine individuals' motivations for producing charcoal, assess the seasonality of charcoal production, how livelihood outcomes vary between men and women, and identify sources of vulnerability for charcoal producer livelihoods. Drawing on data from four focus group exercises in each community and a total of 42 semi-structured interviews, we identify direct (e.g. financial) and indirect (e.g. strengthening of social networks, improved access to goods and services, opportunities for livelihood diversification) benefits that contribute to reducing producers' vulnerability to financial insecurity and improve their livelihoods. Irrespective of the benefits obtained and the actions (e.g. prioritising charcoal production over farming) of producers, participants did not perceive charcoal production as a desirable activity because the work was illegal, stigmatised hard and dangerous. Producers' primary motivations for engaging in production were to provide income to meet one-off purchases of expensive items, respond to an income shock, or to meet recurrent seasonal needs. Under certain conditions women were more dependent on income from charcoal production than men, as they had fewer alternative income generating options available to them. There was no reported management of charcoal resources in the study area, therefore the environmental sustainability of charcoal production and its associated benefits are uncertain. Malawi's current de facto charcoal ban leads to enforcement activities that exacerbate livelihood risks and increase producers' vulnerability to income insecurity.", "Mushroom cultivation and biogas production: A sustainable reuse of organic resources ": "The industry of mushroom cultivation uses a wide variety of lignocellulosic waste and is considered a very efficient way to recycle agro-residues and to produce food. This activity generates tons of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) every year, causing a significant disposal challenge. The SMS is a useful resource for the generation of biogas, since raw material is digested by the metabolism of fungi, performing as a pre-treatment, thus facilitating the subsequent anaerobic digestion and increasing the yield of methane production. Forty-one species of fungi have been used as pre-treatment in different types of residues; among them, 13 were cultivated mushrooms. The potential production of methane using SMS pre-treated with cultivated mushrooms should be added to the list of other common residues used, such as food/vegetable waste and pig manure. Biogas can be used as fuel, and the residues from biogas can be used as fertilizers for food crops. These productive activities can be integrated in a virtuous circle of reuse of organic resources; in which the waste of one activity is used as a substrate for another activity. Given the huge amount of SMS produced, we propose to integrate it into a virtuous circle of resource reutilization for energy generation, particularly as a viable substrate for biogas generation.", "Impacts of climate change on the hydrological regime of the Koshi river basin in the Himalayan region ": "Understanding the potential impact of climate change on the hydrological regime in the Himalayan region is of great importance for sustainable water resources management. This study assessed the historic and projected climate trends in the Koshi river basin using statistical analysis. The hydrological characteristics and the contribution of different runoff components under present and projected future conditions were investigated in the Dudh Koshi sub-basin using the J2000 model. Data for 1995 to 2096 from the Providing REgional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) regional climate model were used in the J2000 model to project the impact of climate change under the A1B climate scenario in mid-century (2040\u20132050) and late-century (2086\u20132096), compared to baseline (2000\u20132010). Present climate showed an increase in average temperature in the river basin at a rate of 0.058\u2009\u00b0C/year for maximum temperature and 0.014\u2009\u00b0C/year for minimum temperature over the past forty years. The model simulation of the hydrological regime from 1985 to1997 was satisfactory. The average annual contribution of snow and glacier melt to total discharge was about 34%, whereas it was 63% in the pre-monsoon season (March to May). The projected future results from the model indicate a 13% increase in annual discharge by mid-century followed by a slight decrease; and a 16% increase in evapotranspiration by the end of the century. Snowfall is projected to decrease substantially due to the rise in temperature, the basin will lose snow storage capacity, and there will be a marked decrease in snowmelt runoff from non-glaciated areas. In contrast, melt from glaciated areas will increase up to mid-century and start decreasing thereafter. The model results suggest that snowfall pattern, snowmelt, discharge, and evapotranspiration are all sensitive to the effects of climate change.", "Nationwide simulation of water, energy, and food nexus: Case study in South Korea and Indonesia ": "Water, energy, and food (WEF) scarcity has been realized as a global issue, and several strategies have been proposed to solve this problem. The WEF Nexus is a novel concept in resources management that integrates and considers feedback connections of water, energy, and food production and consumption in a single framework. The discussion of WEF Nexus commonly involves several parties with different backgrounds and expertise to decide sustainable management plan. This paper introduces a computer simulation model to calculate the supply and consumption, availability, and reliability of water, energy, and food resources on a nationwide scale considering the interconnections of resources. Developed based on a system dynamics algorithm, the Water-Energy-Food Nexus Simulation Model (WEFSiM) simulated the nationwide resources nexus implementing the changes of energy policy in South Korea and capital investment planning of urban water systems in Indonesia. Successfully calculating the reliability index of resources and evaluating the feedback analysis in both case studies, WEFSiM can investigate resource security under plausible future conditions, and stakeholders possibly could utilize it as a decision support tool.", "Study on sky rivers: Concept, theory, and implications ": "Presented in this paper is an introduction to the study on sky rivers, especially the concept, theory, and implications. A sky river is in essence a generalization for a rich variety of meteorological systems including tropical cyclones, extratropical frontal cyclones, shear lines and others from the viewpoint of fluid mechanics. All these meteorological systems share a common feature that, there exists a contacting surface between two air masses with contrasting velocities, temperatures, humidity, and pressures. Under the forces caused by large gradients of state variables normal to the contacting surfaces and other forces, concentrated water vapor flows along paths on the contacting surfaces like river channels on earth surface, characterized by cloud and precipitation processes along the paths. A simplified and direct approach to identify the sky rivers is proposed on the basis of their physical interpretation. Results show that the sky rivers globally exist and have close relations with precipitation. In mathematics, the sky rivers are the discontinuity surfaces of the governing equations for atmospheric flows, and they are formulated in this study as the characteristic surfaces where the characteristic values are real and the derivatives normal to the surface do not exist by means of general theory for partial differential equations to provide a description for time\u2013space evolution of the sky rivers. Finally, future study areas regarding the sky rivers are discussed.", "Model-based design for restoration of a small urban river ": "A model-based design is presented for restoring the small urban river Panke located in Berlin, Germany. This new design process combines high resolution 2D hydraulic modeling with habitat modeling and river-ecological expert knowledge in a highly iterative way. Advances have been made for the habitat modeling: habitat suitability maps have been developed for fish and the habitat suitability for benthos has been assessed by including groups with different hydraulic preferences.\n                  Using the model-based design we have developed preference variants for the Panke which include structures such as pools, riffles, river banks, dead wood as well as aquatic vegetation. To account for the very detailed geometry of some structures such as dead wood, high resolution grids with edge length up to one decimeter have been generated. Furthermore flood protection has been assured. The variants should be constructed in the Panke in 2015. We expect that the ecological conditions for fish and benthos will improve, however this has to be evaluated by further measurements. The model-based approach for the design of enhancement measures delivered valuable hints on current shortcomings in the river morphology, priorities for the creation of new habitats and quantitative information on the increase of suitable areas to be expected. In addition, relating the habitat changes to different flow rates helped to estimate the temporal availability of high quality habitats after the implementation of the measures.", "Using ensemble precipitation forecasts and a rainfall-runoff model for hourly reservoir inflow forecasting during typhoon periods ": "This study proposes an integrated hydrometeorological system combining a fully physically based rainfall-runoff model (i.e., kinematic-wave-based geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph model, KW-GIUH) with a numerical weather model (i.e., Taiwan cooperative precipitation ensemble forecast experiment, TAPEX) for performing hourly reservoir inflow forecasting patterns in the Shihmen Reservoir, in Northern Taiwan. If there is an accurate reservoir inflow with enough lead time, it could help reservoir operators to efficiently operate reservoirs in both dry and wet times of the year. Five historical typhoons, having severe impacts on the study reservoir, were used for model calibration, validation, and further application. For accurate reservoir inflow forecasting, it is necessary to understand a series of uncertainties that occur in this system. Therefore, the present study assessed the forecast uncertainty of the peak inflow and cumulative reservoir inflow on the basis of several TAPEX runs. Using the average forecasting result derived from all TAPEX runs could be less uncertain than randomly choosing a run\u2019s result. For example, the results for Typhoon Saola (2013) showed that the uncertainty in the cumulative reservoir inflow ranged \u221231.3% (first TAPEX run) to 27.0% (sixth run); otherwise, its average forecasting result was only \u22120.9%. On the basis of the analyzed typhoons, the proposed system can provide accurate forecasts of the magnitude and timing of the peak inflow when rainfall distribution is concentrated during typhoon events. The results demonstrated that the proposed hydrometeorological system can substantially represent reservoir inflow forecasting in the Shihmen Reservoir and provide valuable information for operating reservoirs.", "Integrated water quality modelling: Application to the Ribble Basin, U.K. ": "This paper reviews the traditional approach of linking models to cover integrated water management from the upper reaches of catchments through river basins, into estuaries and to the coastal/marine environment. It highlights some of the deficiencies in the approaches currently being adopted in many non-integrated studies, where artificial boundaries are included in the system, and then highlights the need for a more integrated conceptual approach. A case study is discussed, namely the non-compliance of bathing waters along the Fylde Coast and Ribble Basin (U.K.) from riverine inputs, with the inputs arising from Waste water Treatment Works (WwTW), outfalls and drainage systems. A more integrated approach was applied to this estuary, with refinements to the artificial boundaries. Both hydrodynamic and solute transport processes in 1-D and 2-D domains of this estuary were modelled for a wet event in June 1999. The bio-kinetic decay process representation included the impacts of salinity, solar irradiation, turbidity and water temperature on the decay rate. Solutes modelled included faecal coliform, water temperature and salinity. This paper demonstrates that a similar or better accuracy of the coliform concentrations can be achieved using an integrated model based on a realistic representation of physical and biochemical processes. This is significant because the integrated model does not need extensive calibration to give good results. This is therefore a much more robust model which is not influenced significantly by the position of boundaries. The robustness of the model gives increased confidence in predicted results for new scenarios where measured data is not available. This is particularly important for all types of real time water quality prediction (e.g. toxic spills) including bathing water quality. Hence better decisions can be made when considering investment strategies, appropriate for various treatment options and catchment management solutions in the river basin upstream.", "Inter- and intra- annual environmental flow alteration and its implication in the Pearl River Delta, South China ": "Environmental flow is fundamental to ecological health and integrity of a riverine environment. River delta systems have become more and more complicated due to climate change and human activities and these have made a significant impact on significant changes in hydrological processes and the ecological environment. Highly intense human activities and most economically developed regions in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, was selected as case study. Based on observed daily flow data with a length of 50years from seven control stations, inter-annual and intra-annual streamflow alterations in this region were analyzed by using the indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) method, the range of variability approach (RVA), and the histogram matching approach (HMA), and quantitative impact of main factors on inter- and intra-annual streamflow alterations were derived. Results showed the following: (1) Combination of RVA and HMA can better reveal changes of IHAs, so as to more comprehensively evaluate environmental flow alteration of river systems. (2) Discharge diversion due to changes in river channel geometry is the main factor causing inter-annual streamflow alteration in the Northwest River of PRD, whose contributions were 122.35% and 90.08% at Makou and Sanshui stations, respectively. (3) Change in upstream flow is the main factor causing intra-annual streamflow alteration in the Northwest River of PRD, while reservoir operation is the main factor causing intra-annual streamflow alteration in the East River of PRD. (4) Climate change and reservoir operation can make intra-annual distribution of monthly discharge more concentrate and even, respectively. This study contributes to an improved understanding of environmental flow alteration and associated underlying causes of flow regime variations in the river delta region.", "Experimental study of flow characteristics around floodplain single groyne ": "This study investigated the flow around river\u2019s floodplain single groynes. Two different compound channels with one and two symmetrical floodplains having widths of 1- and 2-times of the main channel width, respectively, were used. Both impermeable and permeable groynes with three different relative lengths (relative to the floodplain width) and having three different permeability values of 40, 60, and 80% were investigated. The 3D flow velocities were measured in the horizontal plane at 0.25 and 0.5 of floodplain water depth (hf), and in the vertical plane at the main channel\u2019s centerline. Therefore, the flow velocities in the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical directions, and the flow water surfaces were measured and analyzed. The results showed that, as the groyne permeability increased up to 60%, a reduction of up to 30% to the maximum velocity and 22% to the tip velocity were observed. The permeable groyne length had limited influence on the flow structure. Both the groyne permeability and the length ratio had significant effects on the floodplain water depth. The scouring and the deposition activities resulting from impermeable groynes can be avoided, should the groyne length be kept below half of the floodplain width.", "Erosion and sedimentation patterns associated with restoration structures of bendway weirs ": "Bendway weirs (B.W.), known as new and innovative river training structures, are positioned from the outer bank of the river bend and angled upstream toward the flow. In order to investigate the effect of bendway weirs on the sediment process, experiments were conducted in a 90\u00b0 bend with a relative curvature of 3.3 with and without bendway weirs. Following the installation of bendway weirs with different crest slopes, the scour and sedimentation patterns were evaluated under clear water conditions. To this end, a series of B.W. (7 weirs) with three crest slopes (0, 5, and 10 percent) were installed at the outer bank side in different hydraulic conditions. Erodible bed topography measurements revealed that the maximum scour depth occurred at the tip of the first and last weirs. Moreover, the findings of this study clearly demonstrates the potential of bendway weirs in modifying morphology of river bends and their efficiency in reducing erosion and sedimentation. In general, compared to non-weirs condition, the eroded sediment volume increased by 53, 36, and 15 percent due to the installation of weirs with crest slopes of 0, 5, and 10 percent, respectively. Finally, this study revealed that the maximum scour depth decreased with an increase in the crest slope.", "Field monitoring and design optimization of dropshafts with air circulation pipes ": "Dropshafts with air circulation using an airshaft and horizontal air circulation pipes have been implemented for reducing downstream sewer air pressure and preventing sewer odor emission. There is a need to optimize the design for improved effectiveness and cost-saving. A one-week field monitoring program on a dropshaft with air circulation pipes was conducted in Edmonton, Canada, in order to validate the air flow model and assess the performance of the dropshaft with different air circulation pipe configurations. The air flow model was based on the upstream/downstream conditions of the dropshaft which were obtained from the field monitoring program. This study showed that the horizontal air circulation pipes on the top positions were more efficient in re-circulating air and depressurizing the downstream than the bottom ones, and increasing the size of the top horizontal air circulation pipes could significantly improve their effectiveness. This study provides guidance for designing or retrofitting dropshafts with air circulation pipes.", "A review on ancient urban stream management for flood mitigation in the capital of the Joseon Dynasty, Korea ": "Korean historical documents have abundant records of river works. Extensive related records during the Joseon Dynasty (CE 1392\u20131910) were investigated and analyzed. The evolution of man-made urban stream, Cheonggyecheon the center of old downtown Seoul, Korea was reviewed. In 1410, after a big flood, 52,800 soldiers were mobilized from whole country to improve waterway in the capital. King Sejong continued to enhance the river maintenance. The dredging and expansion for main stream including tributaries was conducted to reduce flood risk. It was a landmark river engineering project for the improvement of the capital\u2019s infrastructure. King Yeongjo planned and initiated the massive river work project. 200,000 people were recruited from five local provinces to widen the stream and to build up the stone embankments, and the waterways were straightened up to present conditions. After the project, the Juncheonsail, a construction report was published and adopted as a practical guideline for river management. As a result, floods in downtown of the capital had been somewhat controlled though, since then every King of the Joseon Dynasty had deep consideration on river maintenance including dredging and embankment against flood and sedimentation. This paper aims to introduce a brief history of the systematic urban river management in ancient Korea.", "Inflow into Korea\u2019s Soyang Dam: Hydrologic variability and links to typhoon impacts ": "East Asia, including the Korean Peninsula, is exposed to the typhoon-related risk, especially in the form of flooding. The aim of this study was to determine the hydrologic variability characteristics of the Soyang River Dam\u2014a representative multipurpose dam in the Korean Han River basin\u2014with a particular focus on the quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of daily inflow into the dam basin and the related typhoon-impacts. Although the frequency of typhoons occurring in the western North Pacific Ocean region does not indicate any distinct increases, typhoons passing the domain of the Korean Peninsula change the summer flow of the Soyang River Dam significantly. Analysis results suggest that 22.6% of the summer flow in the Soyang River Dam can be attributed to typhoons. Furthermore, during the periods characterized by the transition from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a, typhoons exert a large influence on the hydrologic regime. The frequency of typhoon occurrence is highly correlated to the typhoon-induced flow, and the occurrence date of peak flows when typhoons strike was determined to be significantly delayed compared to that of the average years (1974\u20132015). In addition, low-flow metrics show downward trends, however, there is no distinct correlation with the statistical data of typhoons. The results from this study offer baseline information for mid- and long-term plans that cope with natural disasters or the supply of water resources for humans and natural systems according to the seasonal flow patterns of basins. The links to typhoons signify the critical importance of integrative analyses that consider hydrologic and meteorological phenomena.", "Improving performance of a semi-analytical model for nonlinear water waves ": "An efficient semi-analytical solution to the problem of nonlinear water waves propagating at a constant depth is derived using parallel computing techniques. The approach is based on the assumptions of an irrotational flow of an inviscid and incompressible fluid. Velocity potential and free-surface displacement functions are represented in a form based on Fourier series satisfying a formulated initial boundary-value problem by a proper selection of time-dependent coefficients. The eigenfunction expansions are resolved by means of a Fast Fourier Transform technique and a higher-order time-stepping procedure to provide an efficient spectral collocation method of computation of wave-induced free-surface flows. The application of the Fourier transform qualifies the semi-analytical algorithm for efficient parallelization. Hence, the numerical model performance is improved using the computing capabilities of a GPU. The derived semi-analytical approach is easy to implement and may be straightforwardly extended to cover the generation of waves in a flume or a basin. The ability of the model to reproduce nonlinear phenomena is demonstrated in simulations of two- and three-dimensional instabilities of a modulated Stokes wave. The model can be used to solve standard as well as complex wave problems in large computational domains considerably faster than its CPU-based counterpart.", "Sustainable hydraulic engineering through building with nature ": "Hydraulic engineering infrastructures are of concern to many people and are likely to interfere with the environment. Moreover, they are supposed to keep on functioning for many years. In times of rapid societal and environmental change this implies that sustainability and adaptability are important attributes. These are central to Building with Nature (BwN), an innovative approach to hydraulic engineering infrastructure development and operation. Starting from the natural system and making use of nature's ecosystem services, BwN attempts to meet society's needs for infrastructural functionality, and to create room for nature development at the same time. By including natural components in infrastructure designs, flexibility, adaptability to changing environmental conditions and extra functionalities and ecosystem services can be achieved, often at lower costs on a life-cycle basis than \u2018traditional\u2019 engineering solutions. The paper shows by a number of examples that this requires a different way of thinking, acting and interacting.", "Coupled studies of fluvial erosion and cantilever failure for cohesive riverbanks: Case studies in the experimental flumes and U-Tapao River ": "The main objective of this paper is to introduce a novel coupled method for simulating the fluvial erosion, cantilever failure and bedload sediment transport to describe the overhanging properties of experimental banks and natural riverbanks. For fluvial erosion results, the previous relationships between the critical shear stress, and the erodibility coefficient indicated that they do not follow the values of the experimental works and the U-Tapao River, Thailand. Therefore, it is necessary to determine these relationships locally. The cantilever failure results revealed that the dominant failure mechanism of the experimental works is beam-type failure, while shear-type failure is the dominant failure in the U-Tapao River. Finally, a numerical model was developed based on a triple-grid approach to simulate the behaviour of a cantilever within the framework of fluvial erosion, cantilever failure, and bedload transportation. The simulated results showed good agreement with experimental results, and the U-Tapoa River in terms of the temporal variations of spatially averaged bank width, dominant failure mechanism, and overhanging block dimensions.", "Hydraulic performance of a modified constructed wetland system through a CFD-based approach ": "Low-cost household technologies, as horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands, are important to address water and sanitation needs in the Asia-Pacific region in a more integrated and sustainable manner, and a better understanding of these technologies would benefit their engineering design. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of a modified constructed wetland system (EvaTAC) were undertaken to determine empirical effects of geometric and flow parameters on the hydraulic performance and the effluent pollutant fraction. The CFD model was validated by comparing the computed residence time distribution (RTD) with experimental results. RTD functions were then used to quantify hydraulic indexes: short-circuiting, mixing, and moment. The EvaTAC is composed of an evapotranspiration and treatment chamber (CEvaT) and a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSF-CW). For the CEvaT, length and the interaction between length and flow rate were the most important factors for the hydraulic efficiency. For the effluent pollutant fraction, the most important factor was flow rate. For the HSSF-CW, the strongest influence on the hydraulic efficiency was the length. Baffles and the interaction between length and baffles also had significant statistical influence on the hydraulic efficiency. Furthermore, the results showed that flow rate, length, and the interaction between flow rate and length influenced the effluent pollutant fraction significantly. Finally, a poor correlation between hydraulic indexes and effluent pollutant fraction was obtained, indicating that the hydraulic indexes are not good predictors of the effluent pollutant fraction.", "Estimation of longitudinal dispersion coefficient in rivers ": "The longitudinal dispersion coefficient is a crucial parameter for 1D water quality analyzing in natural rivers, and different types of empirical equations have been presented in the literature. To evaluate the precision of those commonly used equations, 116 sets of measured data for rivers in U.S. and UK have been collected for comparison. Firstly, the precisions of selected ten empirical equations under different aspect ratio (water surface width B/water depth H) have been compared, and calculation shows that most of the equations have underestimated the longitudinal dispersion when 20\u00a0<\u00a0B/H\u00a0<\u00a0100, in which most of the natural rivers located. The regression analysis on the collected data sets proved that the product of water depth H and the cross-sectional averaged velocity U has a higher linear correlation with the longitudinal dispersion coefficient than the product of H and shear velocity u\u2217, and then a new expression of longitudinal dispersion coefficient, which is a combination of the product of HU and other two nondimensional hydraulic and geometric parameters, was deduced and the exponents were determined by the regression analysis. The comparison between the measured data and the predicted results shows that the presented equation has the highest precision for the studied natural rivers. To further evaluate the precision of the empirical formulae to artificial open channels, comparison was made between laboratory measuring data and empirical equation prediction, and the results have shown that the newly presented model is effective at predicting longitudinal dispersion in trapezoidal artificial channels too.", "Cyclic steps: A phenomenon of supercritical shallow flow from the high mountains to the bottom of the ocean ": "Cyclic steps constitute a characteristic bedform of Froude-supercritical shallow flow over an erodible bed. They are long-wave features that are bounded by hydraulic jumps and migrate upstream. They can be seen in alluvial streams, stream in cohesive sediment, bedrock streams, and on the seafloor in response to turbidity currents. Recent progress in the modeling of cyclic steps is summarized.", "The influence of non-uniform blockages on transient wave behavior and blockage detection in pressurized water pipelines ": "Blockages in piping systems are formed from potentially complex combinations of bio-film build up, corrosion by-products, and sediment deposition. Transient-based methods seek to detect blockages by analyzing the evolution of small amplitude pressure waves. In theory, such methods can be efficient, nearly non-intrusive and economical but, thus far, studies have only considered symmetrical blockages, uniform in both the radial and longitudinal directions. Laboratory experiments are described here that involve pipe blockages with various levels of irregularity and severity; the way the transient response is affected by a non-uniform blockage is investigated. The differences between uniform and non-uniform blockages are quantified in terms of the rate that wave envelopes attenuate and the degree that phases are shifted. Two different methods for modeling these impacts are compared, namely through an increase in pipe roughness and through a wave scattering model. Wave scattering is shown to play a dominant role in explaining both wave envelope attenuation and phase shift. The accuracy of existing transient-based methods of blockage detection in the frequency domain is also examined, and is found that the predictions of rough blockage locations and sizes by current method are in good agreement with data, with relatively larger discrepancies for rough blockage lengths.", "Optimization model for integrated river basin management with the hybrid WOAPSO algorithm ": "This work examines the effectiveness of a newly-developed optimization framework for river basin management. The proposed framework relies on the newly developed WOAPSO algorithm, which is a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm combining two conventional metaheuristic algorithms, namely the weed optimization algorithm (WOA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). Two case studies are presented in this study to evaluate the performance of the WOAPSO algorithm. The first case study consists of a ten-reservoir river basin example which compares the performance and reliability of the hybrid WOAPSO algorithm with that of linear programing (LP), non-linear programing (NLP), WOA, and the PSO algorithm. Results indicate the hybrid WOAPSO finds solutions meeting downstream water demands with 99.94% of reliability (with respect to the global optimum, as derived by LP) in the ten-reservoir system. It outperforms the WOA and PSO, which feature lower reliabilities than that achieved by WOAPSO. The second case study demonstrates failure of the conventional NLP optimization scheme in solving a real-world three-reservoir hydropower optimization problem which maximizes the efficiency index of hydropower production. The newly-introduced WOAPSO algorithm minimizes the objective function with superior efficiency compared with those of the WOA and PSO, in terms of the convergence rate and the achieved best values of the objective function. Furthermore, the WOAPSO is proven more reliable for solving complex multi-reservoir systems within the context of integrated river basin management than classic and evolutionary optimization algorithms.", "Contribution of climatic variability and human activities to stream flow changes in the Haraz River basin, northern Iran ": "In northern Iran\u2019s Haraz River basin between 1975 and 2010, hydrological sensitivity, double mass curve, and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) methods were applied to monitoring and analysing changes in stream flow brought on by climatic variability and human activities. Applied to analyse trends in annual and seasonal runoff over this period, the sequential MK test showed a sudden change point in stream flow in 1994. The study period was, therefore, divided into two sub-periods: 1975\u20131994 and 1995\u20132010. The SWAT model showed obvious changes in water resource components between the two periods: in comparison to the period of 1975\u20131994, sub-watershed-scale stream flow and soil moisture decreased during 1995\u20132010. Changes in evapotranspiration were negligible compared to those in stream flow and soil moisture. The hydrological sensitivity method indicated that climatic variability and human activities contributed to 29.86% and 70.14%, respectively, of changes in annual stream flow, while the SWAT model placed these contributions at 34.78% and 65.21%, respectively. The double mass curve method indicated the contribution of climatic variability to stream flow changes to be 57.5% for the wet season and 22.87% for the dry season, while human activities contributed 42.5% and 77.13%, respectively. Accordingly, in the face of climatic variability, measures should be developed and implemented to mitigate its impacts and maintain eco-environmental integrity and water supplies.", "Assessment of surface water quality via multivariate statistical techniques: A\u00a0case study of the Songhua River Harbin region, China ": "Multivariate statistical approaches, such as cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA), were used to evaluate temporal/spatial variations in water quality and identify latent sources of water pollution in the Songhua River Harbin region. The dataset included data on 15 parameters for six different sites in the region over a five-year monitoring period (2005\u20132009). Hierarchical CA grouped the six monitored sites into three clusters based on their similarities, corresponding to regions of low pollution (LP), moderate pollution (MP) and high pollution (HP). PCA/FA of the three different groups resulted in five latent factors accounting for 70.08%, 67.54% and 76.99% of the total variance in the water quality datasets of LP, MP and HP, respectively. This indicates that the parameters responsible for water quality variation are primarily related to organic pollution and nutrients (non-point sources: animal husbandry and agricultural activities), temperature (natural), heavy metal and toxic pollution (point sources: industry) in relatively LP areas; oxygen-consuming organic pollution (point sources: industry and domestic wastewater), temperature (natural), heavy metal and petrochemical pollution (point source: industry), nutrients (non-point sources: agricultural activities, organic decomposition and geologic deposits) in MP areas; and heavy metal, oil and petrochemical pollution (point source: industry), oxygen-consuming organic pollution (point source: domestic sewage and wastewater treatment plants), nutrients (non-point sources: agricultural activities, runoff in soils) in HP areas of the Harbin region. Therefore, the identification of the main potential environmental hazards in different regions by this study will help managers make better and more informed decisions about how to improve water quality.", "Envelope curves for the specific discharge of extreme floods in Malaysia ": "The relationship between peak specific discharge and watershed area is examined for large, rare and extreme floods in Malaysia using a distributed hydrological model. Envelope curves for specific discharge for these events and the uncertainty is quantified. The relationships between rainfall duration and intensity as a function of watershed size were also examined. As a result, three main regions were defined to estimate the peak discharge as a function of watershed size for large, extreme and rare floods. The average magnitudes for the PMP and the world\u2019s extreme rainfall events were 5 and 12 times larger than the 100-year event, respectively. The envelope curves may assist engineers and other interested parties to estimate the peak discharge for watershed up to 100,000\u202fkm2, especially for ungauged watersheds.", "Modeling and analysis of rainfall processes in the context of climate change for Mekong, Chi, and Mun River Basins (Thailand) ": "This paper provides a detailed characterization of the observed daily rainfall series available for the Mekong, Chi, and Mun River Basins in the context of climate change; and describes the linkage between climate simulations given by Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and the local rainfall characteristics using the popular Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM). Observed daily rainfall records at 11 stations in the study area for the 1961\u20132007 period were considered. Results of characterizing the available rainfall data for the 1961\u20131990 and 1991\u20132007 periods show different trends of rainfall characteristics for different locations in the study area. However, a consistent increase in the annual maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD) was observed in the Chi catchment area, the eastern part of the Mun watershed, and the western portion of the Mekong River Basin. In addition, decrease in the annual maximum daily rainfall (AMDR) was found in most locations of the study area, except for the central part of the Chi and Mun River Basins. Moreover, it has been shown in this paper that the SDSM could adequately describe the basic statistical and physical characteristics of the observed rainfall processes for the calibration (1961\u20131975) and validation (1976\u20131990) periods. This statistical downscaling method was then used to project future rainfall characteristics for the 1961\u20132099 period using the climate simulations given by the UK HadCM3 (HadCM3) model under A2 and B2 scenarios (HadCM3A2 and HadCM3B2), and by the Canadian GCM3 (CGCM3) model under A2 and A1B scenarios (CGCM3A2 and CGCM3A1B). In general, the projected trends of rainfall characteristics by both HadCM3 and CGCM3 were found to be consistent with the observed historical trends. However, there was a large difference in the projection results given by these two models. This would indicate the presence of high uncertainty in climate simulations provided by different GCMs. In addition, the climate change impacts on the flood and drought problems in the study area were shown using the CDD and AMDR indices of 100-year return period.", "Between the tides: Modelling the elevation of Australia's exposed intertidal zone at continental scale ": "The intertidal zone represents a critical transition between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, supporting a complex mosaic of highly productive and biologically diverse habitats. However, our understanding of these important coastal environments is limited by a lack of spatially consistent topographic data, which can be extremely challenging and costly to obtain at continental-scale. Satellite remote sensing represents an important resource for monitoring extensive coastal zones. Previous approaches to modelling the elevation of the intertidal zone using earth observation (EO) data have been restricted to small study regions or have relied on manual image interpretation, thus limiting their ability to be applied consistently over large geographic extents. In this study, we present an automated open-source approach to generate satellite-derived elevation data for over 15,387\u202fkm2 of intertidal terrain across the entire Australian coastline. Our approach combines global tidal modelling with a 30-year time series archive of spatially and spectrally calibrated Landsat satellite data managed within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform. The resulting National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model (NIDEM) dataset provides an unprecedented three-dimensional representation of Australia's vast exposed intertidal zone at 25\u202fm spatial resolution. We validate our model against LiDAR, RTK GPS and multibeam bathymetry datasets, finding that modelled elevations are highly accurate across sandy beach (\u00b10.41\u202fm RMSE) and tidal flat environments (\u00b10.39\u202fm RMSE). Model performance was least accurate (\u00b12.98\u202fm RMSE) within rocky shores and reefs and other complex coastal environments with extreme and variable tidal regimes. We discuss key challenges associated with modelling intertidal elevation including tidal model performance and biased observations from sun-synchronous satellites, and suggest future directions to improve the accuracy and utility of continental-scale intertidal elevation modelling. Our model can be applied to tidally-influenced coastal environments globally, addressing a key gap between the availability of sub-tidal bathymetry and terrestrial elevation data.", "Microplastic pollution in commercial salt for human consumption: A review ": "Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles with less than 5\u202fmm in size that are considered global environmental pollutants. The MPs present in the environment result from the successive breakdown of larger plastic pieces or from the direct input of micro- and nano-sized particles used in various industries and products available to consumers. Such MPs have been found in several wild species and other natural resources, including some consumed as food by humans, with possible adverse effects on ecosystem and human health. The central aim of this work was to review the published literature regarding the contamination of sea commercial salts (sea and terrestrial origins) and its possible impacts on human health. Moreover, to lead to a comprehensive understanding of the paradigm, a short introduction and revision of the environmental contamination by MPs and its effects are included. MPs have been found in commercial salts from 128 brands, from 38 different countries spanning over five continents. The concentration of MPs found in the samples analysed is lower than the concentrations of MPs reported in other resources, such as blue mussels. However, as commercial salts are used every day and by all humans, they constitute a long-term exposure route for the general population in addition to others (e.g., animals consumed as food by humans, water, air). Therefore, commercial salts contaminated with MPs may contribute to the potential long-term adverse effects resulting from human exposure to these particles.", "Vertical zonation is the main distribution pattern of littoral assemblages on rocky shores at a regional scale ": "Vertical variation in the distribution of rocky shore assemblages is greater than horizontal variation, as shown by univariate and multivariate analysis performed with data obtained along 1000\u00a0km of shoreline and covering from the upper supralittoral to the upper infralittoral zone (\u22121\u00a0m). Consequently, vertical littoral zonation is a consistent pattern at a regional scale within the same biogeographical zone. While their distribution varies at the same shore height, marine species and assemblages from rocky shores show a specific vertical sequence known as zonation. A key question in ecology is how consistent is zonation along large spatial scales. The aim of this study is to show distribution patterns of littoral assemblages at a regional scale and to identify the most relevant abiotic factors associated to such patterns. The study is based on a detailed and extensive survey at a regional scale on a tideless rocky shore. Benthic macroflora and macrofauna of 750 relev\u00e9s were described along the vertical axis of 143 transects distributed across the shoreline of Catalonia (NW Mediterranean). The Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) first axis is highly related to the height on the shore: species, relev\u00e9s, and assemblages grade from lower to upper height (infralittoral to supralittoral). As observed in nature, different assemblages co-occur at the same height at different sites, which is shown along DCA second axis. The abiotic variables that best explain the assemblage distribution patterns are: height (75% of the model inertia), longitude (14.6%), latitude (7.2%) and transect slope (2.9%). The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) first axis is related to height on the shore and explains four times more variance than CCA second axis, which is related to the horizontal gradient. Generalized Lineal Model (GLM) results show that height on the shore is the factor explaining most of the variance in species presence. Most studied species show distribution patterns related to latitude and longitude, but always in a much smaller proportion than to height.", "Variability in the organic carbon stocks, sources, and accumulation rates of Indonesian mangrove ecosystems ": "Mangrove ecosystems are an important natural carbon sink that accumulate and store large amounts of organic carbon (Corg), in particular in the sediment. However, the magnitude of carbon stocks and the rate of carbon accumulation (CAR) vary geographically due to a large variation of local factors. In order to better understand the blue carbon sink of mangrove ecosystems, we measured organic carbon stocks, sources and accumulation rates in three Indonesian mangrove ecosystems with different environmental settings and conditions; (i) a degraded estuarine mangrove forest in the Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL), Central Java, (ii) an undegraded estuarine mangrove forest in Berau region, East Kalimantan, and (iii) a pristine marine mangrove forest on Kongsi Island, Thousand Islands, Jakarta. In general, Corg stocks were higher in estuarine than in marine mangroves, although a large variation was observed among the estuarine mangroves. The mean total Corg stock in Berau (615\u202f\u00b1\u202f181\u202fMg\u202fC ha\u22121) is twice as high as that in SAL (298\u202f\u00b1\u202f181\u202fMg\u202fC ha\u22121). However, the Segara Anakan Lagoon displayed large within-system variation with a much higher Corg stock in the eastern (483\u202f\u00b1\u202f124\u202fMg\u202fC ha\u22121) than in the central lagoon (167\u202f\u00b1\u202f36\u202fMg\u202fC ha\u22121). The predominant accumulation of autochthonous mangrove organic matter likely contributed to the higher Corg stocks in Berau and the eastern SAL. Interestingly, the CAR distribution pattern in SAL is opposite to that of its Corg stocks. The central SAL that receives high sediment inputs from the hinterland has a much higher CAR than the eastern SAL (658\u202f\u00b1\u202f311\u202fg\u202fC m\u22122 yr\u22121 and 194\u202f\u00b1\u202f46\u202fg\u202fC m\u22122 yr\u22121, respectively), while Berau has one of the highest CAR (1722\u202f\u00b1\u202f183\u202fg\u202fC m\u22122 yr\u22121) ever measured. It appears that these large differences are driven by the environmental setting and conditions, mainly sediment dynamics and hydrodynamics, landform, and vegetation conditions. It is inferred that quantifying carbon accumulation in sediments is a useful tool in estimating the present-day carbon storage of mangrove ecosystems. This is a precondition for taking measures under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) schemes.", "Microplastics as vector for heavy metal contamination from the marine environment ": "The permanent presence of microplastics in the marine environment is considered a global threat to several marine animals. Heavy metals and microplastics are typically included in two different classes of pollutants but the interaction between these two stressors is poorly understood.\n                  During 14 days of experimental manipulation, we examined the adsorption of two heavy metals, copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), leached from an antifouling paint to virgin polystyrene (PS) beads and aged polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fragments in seawater. We demonstrated that heavy metals were released from the antifouling paint to the water and both microplastic types adsorbed the two heavy metals. This adsorption kinetics was described using partition coefficients and mathematical models. Partition coefficients between pellets and water ranged between 650 and 850 for Cu on PS and PVC, respectively. The adsorption of Cu was significantly greater in PVC fragments than in PS, probably due to higher surface area and polarity of PVC. Concentrations of Cu and Zn increased significantly on PVC and PS over the course of the experiment with the exception of Zn on PS. As a result, we show a significant interaction between these types of microplastics and heavy metals, which can have implications for marine life and the environment. These results strongly support recent findings where plastics can play a key role as vectors for heavy metal ions in the marine system. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of monitoring marine litter and heavy metals, mainly associated with antifouling paints, particularly in the framework of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).", "Behavioral adaptations of sandy beach macrofauna in face of climate change impacts: A conceptual framework ": "Sandy beaches are severely under-represented in the literature on climate-change ecology, yet different lines of evidence suggest that the macrofauna inhabiting these narrow and dynamic environments located at the land-sea interface is being reorganized under the influence of this large scale and long-lasting stressor. This is reflected in macrofaunal sensitivity to increasing sea surface temperature, sea-level rise, extreme events and erosion of the narrow physical habitat. However, evidence of behavioral responses by sandy beach macrofauna that are consistent with expectations under climate change is scarce and fragmentary. In this paper, specific hypotheses are formulated for how behavioral adaptations in sandy beach macrofauna are predicted to respond to climate change impacts. Firstly, a conceptual framework and an overview of macrofauna behavioral adaptation features are provided. Secondly, the effects of main climate change drivers on sandy beaches are summarized. Thirdly, a conceptual framework is developed giving behavioral adaptations of sandy beach macrofauna under climate change pressure. The degree to which observations on behavioral adaptations of beach animals conform to expectations under specific climate change drivers (sea level rise, sea surface temperature, winds and storminess, rainfall, acidification and eutrophication) is explored. Taking into account the empirical evidence and the theoretical framework detailed in the paper, emergent hypotheses/predictions are proposed. Climate change drivers are expected to impact habitat features and consequently the behavioral expression of macrofauna as active responses to habitat changes. Behavioral adaptations are expected to be impaired, more variable or disrupted, thus decreasing fitness, causing local population extirpations and potentially triggering a range of cascading effects of ecological change in the beach ecosystem. Biodiversity loss will be the outcome of the negative pressures driven by climate change. The specificity of sandy beaches as narrow ecotones between sea and land may be lost under climate change pressure, adversely affecting fine-tuned macrofaunal adaptations and therefore ecosystem functioning. Strictly adapted endemic sandy beach fauna will be especially subjected to local extirpations, while species with a large reaction norm (i.e. phenotypic and behavioral plasticity) may face changes by dispersal and exploitation of new niches. Under climate change impacts, biodiversity loss is predicted, which would hamper beach ecosystem resilience. The limits to which sandy beach macrofauna responds and can behaviorally adapt to environmental change are worthy of exploration, in view of the increasing influence of the long-lasting climate driven stressors threatening these ecosystems at risk.", "Recommended priorities for research on ecological impacts of ocean and coastal acidification in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic ": "The estuaries and continental shelf system of the United States Mid-Atlantic are subject to ocean acidification driven by atmospheric CO2, and coastal acidification caused by nearshore and land-sea interactions that include biological, chemical, and physical processes. These processes include freshwater and nutrient input from rivers and groundwater; tidally-driven outwelling of nutrients, inorganic carbon, alkalinity; high productivity and respiration; and hypoxia. Hence, these complex dynamic systems exhibit substantial daily, seasonal, and interannual variability that is not well captured by current acidification research on Mid-Atlantic organisms and ecosystems. We present recommendations for research priorities that target better understanding of the ecological impacts of acidification in the U. S. Mid-Atlantic region. Suggested priorities are: 1) Determining the impact of multiple stressors on our resource species as well as the magnitude of acidification; 2) Filling information gaps on major taxa and regionally important species in different life stages to improve understanding of their response to variable temporal scales and sources of acidification; 3) Improving experimental approaches to incorporate realistic environmental variability and gradients, include interactions with other environmental stressors, increase transferability to other systems or organisms, and evaluate community and ecosystem response; 4) Determining the capacity of important species to acclimate or adapt to changing ocean conditions; 5) Considering multi-disciplinary, ecosystem-level research that examines acidification impacts on biodiversity and biotic interactions; and 6) Connecting potential acidification-induced ecological impacts to ecosystem services and the economy. These recommendations, while developed for the Mid-Atlantic, can be applicable to other regions will help align research towards knowledge of potential larger-scale ecological and economic impacts.", "Spatial assessment of intertidal seagrass meadows using optical imaging systems and a lightweight drone ": "Seagrass ecosystems are highly sensitive to environmental change. They are also in global decline and under threat from a variety of anthropogenic factors. There is now an urgency to establish robust monitoring methodologies so that changes in seagrass abundance and distribution in these sensitive coastal environments can be understood. Typical monitoring approaches have included remote sensing from satellites and airborne platforms, ground based ecological surveys and snorkel/scuba surveys. These techniques can suffer from temporal and spatial inconsistency, or are very localised making it hard to assess seagrass meadows in a structured manner. Here we present a novel technique using a lightweight (sub 7\u00a0kg) drone and consumer grade cameras to produce very high spatial resolution (\u223c4\u00a0mm pixel\u22121) mosaics of two intertidal sites in Wales, UK. We present a full data collection methodology followed by a selection of classification techniques to produce coverage estimates at each site. We trialled three classification approaches of varying complexity to investigate and illustrate the differing performance and capabilities of each. Our results show that unsupervised classifications perform better than object-based methods in classifying seagrass cover. We also found that the more sparsely vegetated of the two meadows studied was more accurately classified - it had lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between observed and classified coverage (9\u20139.5%) compared to a more densely vegetated meadow (RMSD 16\u201322%). Furthermore, we examine the potential to detect other biotic features, finding that lugworm mounds can be detected visually at coarser resolutions such as 43\u00a0mm pixel\u22121, whereas smaller features such as cockle shells within seagrass require finer grained data (<17\u00a0mm pixel\u22121).", "Environmental drivers of benthic community structure in a deep sub-arctic fjord system ": "Fjords are unique geomorphological features that are found globally along (previously) glaciated coasts. They are characteristic for the entire Norwegian coast, where growing human populations and economic development increasingly impact the associated fjord ecosystems, and accordingly basic knowledge about ecosystem structure and functioning is needed. Knowledge about benthic systems within deep basins (over 400\u202fm) of sub-Arctic fjords is currently missing and it remains questionable whether our understanding of similarly deep temperate fjords or shallower sub-arctic fjords is directly transferable to such systems. This study aims to investigate the patterns of soft-bottom benthic communities within a northern Norwegian deep multibasin fjord system and relate them to the prevailing environmental conditions, following a sampling strategy of many-sites with one-sample each. Here we show that oxygen content of the water and organic matter gradients in the sediment, structure the benthic communities of the fjord reflecting the main basins. We found that the community of the deepest basin (>700\u202fm) of this sub-Arctic fjord is similar to the community just outside of Tysfjord at the same depth but differ from other communities within the fjord. Furthermore, the deep basin community reflects deep communities of temperate fjords and the deep Skagerrak. The community within the innermost basin is well adapted to periodic hypoxia with low quality or degraded food supply. Our results demonstrated that fjord specific multibasin topography and the corresponding environmental factors are important drivers of ecological processes, which resulted in distinct benthic communities in each of the three basins. The management of such heterogeneous fjord ecosystems should take an adaptive approach and apply measures that take the differences of these benthic communities into account.", "Climate change and coral reef bleaching: An ecological assessment of long-term impacts, recovery trends and future outlook ": "Since the early 1980s, episodes of coral reef bleaching and mortality, due primarily to climate-induced ocean warming, have occurred almost annually in one or more of the world's tropical or subtropical seas. Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe events typically accompanying coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere phenomena, such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral community structure in many others, with a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not. The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally extirpated; (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation state; (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged in efforts to allocate conservation activity according to geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover in the long term.", "Drivers and impacts of water level fluctuations in the Mississippi River delta: Implications for delta restoration ": "This review synthesizes the knowledge regarding the environmental forces affecting water level variability in the coastal waters of the Mississippi River delta and relates these fluctuations to planned river diversions. Water level fluctuations vary significantly across temporal and spatial scales, and are subject to influences from river flow, tides, vegetation, atmospheric forcing, climate change, and anthropogenic activities. Human impacts have strongly affected water level variability in the Mississippi River delta and other deltas worldwide. Collectively, the research reviewed in this article is important for enhancing environmental, economic, and social resilience and sustainability by assessing, mitigating, and adapting to geophysical changes that will cascade to societal systems in the coming decades in the economically and environmentally important Mississippi River delta. Specifically, this information provides a context within which to evaluate the impacts of diversions on the hydrology of the Mississippi delta and creates a benchmark for the evaluation of the impact of water level fluctuations on coastal restoration projects worldwide.", "Scientific considerations for acidification monitoring in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Region ": "Coastal and ocean acidification has the potential to cause significant environmental and societal impacts. Monitoring carbonate chemistry parameters over spatial and temporal scales is challenging, especially with limited resources. A lack of monitoring data can lead to a limited understanding of real-world conditions. Without such data, robust experimental and model design is challenging, and the identification and understanding of episodic acidification events is nearly impossible. We present considerations for resource managers, academia, and industry professionals who are currently developing acidification monitoring programs in the Mid-Atlantic region. We highlight the following considerations for deliberation: 1) leverage existing infrastructure to include multiple carbonate chemistry parameters as well as other water quality measurements, 2) direct monitoring efforts in subsurface waters rather than limiting monitoring to surface waters, 3) identify the best available sensor technology for long-term, in-situ monitoring, 4) monitor across a salinity gradient to account for the complexity of estuarine, coastal, and ocean environments, and identify potential areas of enhanced vulnerability, 5) increase sampling frequency to capture variability, 6) consider other drivers (e.g., freshwater discharge, nutrients, physiochemical parameters) that may affect acidification, and 7) conduct or continue monitoring in specific ecological and general regions that may have enhanced vulnerability. Through the incorporation of these considerations, individual monitoring programs can more efficiently and effectively leverage resources and build partnerships for a more comprehensive data collection in the region. While these considerations focus on the Mid-Atlantic region), similar strategies can be used to leverage resources in other locations.", "Impact of climate change on UK estuaries: A review of past trends and potential projections ": "UK estuarine environments are regulated by inter-acting physical processes, including tidal, wave, surge, river discharge and sediment supply. They regulate the fluxes of nutrients, pollutants, pathogens and viruses that determine whether coastlines achieve the Good Environmental Status (GEnS) required by the EU's Marine Strategy Directive. We review 20th century trends and 21st century projections of changes to climatic drivers, and their potential for altering estuarine bio-physical processes. Sea-level rise will cause some marine habitats to expand, and others diminish in area extent. The overall consequences of estuarine morphodynamics to these habitat shifts, and vice-versa, are unknown. Increased temperatures could intensify microbial pathogen concentrations and increase public health risk. The patterns of change of other climatic drivers are difficult to predict (e.g., river flows and storm surges). Projected increased winter river flows throughout UK catchments will enhance the risks of coastal eutrophication, harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in some contexts, although there are spatial variabilities in river flow projections. The reproductive success of estuarine biota is sensitive to saline intrusion and corresponding turbidity maxima, which are projected to gradually shift landwards as a result of sea-level rise. Although more-frequent flushing events in winter and longer periods of drought in summer are predicted, whereby the subsequent estuarine mixing and recovery rates are poorly understood. With rising estuarine salinities, subtidal species can penetrate deeper into estuaries, although this will depend on the resilience/adaptation of the species. Many climate and impact predictions lack resolution and spatial cover. Long-term monitoring and increased research, which considers the catchment-river-estuary-coast system as a whole, is needed to support risk predicting and mitigatory strategies.", "A systematic survey of bar-built estuaries along the California coast ": "Of California's 577 coastal confluences, 278 of these are characterized as bar-built estuaries or coastal river mouth lagoons. Development during the 20th century has led to varying and often extreme levels of alteration to these estuarine systems. Changes to the natural timing and magnitude of riverine flows and modification of the mouth have affected the frequency and depth of marsh plain flooding, as well as the timing of breaching events. This project used standard assessment techniques to document and quantify the current environmental condition of 32\u202fbar-built estuaries of various sizes, distributed throughout California. Estuary lagoon filling/flushing patterns (documented using pressure/temperature loggers) were found to fluctuate most in spring (due to bar closure with continued fluvial discharge) and late fall (due to high wave overtopping events). These spring and fall water level increases led to marsh plain flooding. Marshes were flooded for periods ranging from 9 to 65 days. Sites that supported long summer ponding periods increased hydraulic connectivity with side channels and back water environments and were characterized as having optimal habitat condition using the California Rapid Assessment Method. Bar-built estuaries with lower condition were found to have higher abundance of agriculture and impervious surface within their watersheds. The lowest condition sites had more than 65% impervious surface within the 2\u202fkm radius around the bar-built estuary. Also, bar-built estuary systems where bar management occurred (periodic or permanent) were found to have a lower habitat condition and support fewer native plant species. Summer salinity exceeded 25 within portions of thirteen of the 32 estuaries and all but three systems had water within portions of the main channel with salinity below 5. Our findings suggest that water elevations, dissolved oxygen concentrations, salinity and temperature vary widely within bar-built estuaries and thus, management decisions should account for this variability to ensure support for a diversity of endemic species.", "Lagrangian observations of estuarine residence times, dispersion, and trapping in the Salish Sea ": "Estuaries are important mediators in the transport of freshwater, sediment, and dissolved material into the ocean, and many studies have investigated mean estuarine circulation. However, it is not clear how descriptions of the mean circulation are linked to the motion of individual water parcels, or of discrete items floating within the system, nor how they related to the variability in this dispersal. An obvious approach to characterizing this variability is to actually measure dispersal by tracking Lagrangian drifters. Recent technological advances have dramatically decreased the cost of satellite-tracked and monitored drifters, making longer deployments of large numbers of expendable drifters much more feasible. Here we take advantage of this opportunity to directly characterize the seaward flow and dispersion of surface water in a relatively well-studied estuarine system (the Salish Sea on the NE Pacific coast), combining 2200 drifter-days of data from more than 400 tracked drifters with the deployment of nearly 6000 traditional driftcards. Residence times in different parts of the system estimated from the drifter observations are similar but systematically lower than those derived from other methods, and we speculate that this may be because surface drifts are faster than layer-mean drifts in a fjord-type estuarine system. We also find that drifters tend to ground on shore, and that time to-grounding from different source locations has an approximately exponential distribution with a mean of only a few days, much less than the transport time to the ocean. The estuary is therefore a highly efficient trap for floating objects. Finally, we quantify a dispersion coefficient, finding that dispersion is a critical component of transport in parts of the Salish Sea, often much more important than mean advection. The mean is visible only after averaging for weeks or months.", "Tidal wave propagation along The Mekong deltaic coast ": "A two-dimensional, barotropic numerical model was employed to investigate the dynamics of tidal wave propagation in the South China Sea with a particular interest for its characteristics along the Mekong deltaic coast. The study indicates that tidal waves propagate from the Pacific Ocean into the South China Sea mainly through the Luzon Strait (LS), where the K1 diurnal tide dominates due to a quarter wavelength resonance in this semi-enclosed basin, and that the incoming tidal waves from the Celebes open boundary play a more important role than those from the Andaman and Flores open boundaries. Previous studies have not explained why both adjacent seas including the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand are dominated by a diurnal tide, while a semidiurnal tide dominates along the eastern Mekong deltaic coast. By means of Green's law, continental shelf tidal resonance theory and standing wave theory, this study clarifies that the large amplified M2 semidiurnal amplitude leading to a prevailing mixed semidiurnal tide is caused not only by the shoaling effect and the continental shelf oscillation resonance phenomenon but also by the position on the standing wave anti-node line. Moreover, the finding of radial tidal currents occurring along the southern Mekong estuarine coast has not been revealed in earlier studies. Based on a number of numerical, geometrically schematised experiments, we suggest that the interaction between the large amplified amplitude near the shoreline associated with the adjacent low amplitude band system, causing convex hydraulic gradients of tidal amplitude due to basin geometry as well as sloping topography, is the mechanism for developing these radial tidal current systems. The results reveal that wind monsoon climate could cause either damped or amplified tidal amplitudes around the Mekong deltaic coast of which approximately 2\u20133\u202fcm is due to the changing atmospheric pressure, the tangential stress of wind over the water surface and wind enhanced bottom friction. Also, this study suggests that the tidal generating forces should be considered to achieve accurate model results depending on the geographical region of interest. Findings achieved from this study contribute to a deeper insight of tidal wave propagation from a deep ocean to a shallow flat basin similar to the South China Sea and its Mekong deltaic coast.", "Microplastic particles in sediments of Lagoon of Venice, Italy: First observations on occurrence, spatial patterns and identification ": "In order to improve knowledge of the identification, distribution and abundances of microplastic particles of 1\u00a0mm or less (S-MPPs) in the coastal area of the Mediterranean region, a preliminary monitoring survey was carried out in a transitional environment along the north-eastern Italian coasts, the Lagoon of Venice. S-MPPs were evaluated in sediments collected from 10 sites chosen in shallow areas variously affected by natural conditions and anthropogenic influences (i.e., landward stations influenced by freshwater inputs, seaward areas near sea inlets, and sites influenced by the presence of aquaculture farms, industry and city centers). S-MPPs, extracted from bulk sediments by density separation, were counted and identified by Fourier-Transform Infrared Micro-spectroscopy (\u03bcFT-IR). The \u03bcFT-IR process included automatic surface chemical mapping and references to an infrared library database to identify the compositional spectra of particles. S-MPPs were recovered from all samples \u2013 a fact which emphasizes their extensive distribution throughout the Lagoon. Total abundances varied from 2175 to 672\u00a0S-MPPs\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0d.w., higher concentrations generally being observed in landward sites. Of the ten polymer types identified, the most abundant, accounting for more than 82% of total S-MPPs, were polyethylene and polypropylene. The most frequent size (93% of observed microplastics) was in the range 30\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcm. Total S-MPP values were significantly correlated with the finer sediment fraction and with the metal pollution index.", "Mangrove forests: Resilience, protection from tsunamis, and responses to global climate change ": "This review assesses the degree of resilience of mangrove forests to large, infrequent disturbance (tsunamis) and their role in coastal protection, and to chronic disturbance events (climate change) and the future of mangroves in the face of global change. From a geological perspective, mangroves come and go at considerable speed with the current distribution of forests a legacy of the Holocene, having undergone almost chronic disturbance as a result of fluctuations in sea-level. Mangroves have demonstrated considerable resilience over timescales commensurate with shoreline evolution. This notion is supported by evidence that soil accretion rates in mangrove forests are currently keeping pace with mean sea-level rise. Further support for their resilience comes from patterns of recovery from natural disturbances (storms, hurricanes) which coupled with key life history traits, suggest pioneer-phase characteristics. Stand composition and forest structure are the result of a complex interplay of physiological tolerances and competitive interactions leading to a mosaic of interrupted or arrested succession sequences, in response to physical/chemical gradients and landform changes. The extent to which some or all of these factors come into play depends on the frequency, intensity, size, and duration of the disturbance. Mangroves may in certain circumstances offer limited protection from tsunamis; some models using realistic forest variables suggest significant reduction in tsunami wave flow pressure for forests at least 100 m in width. The magnitude of energy absorption strongly depends on tree density, stem and root diameter, shore slope, bathymetry, spectral characteristics of incident waves, and tidal stage upon entering the forest. The ultimate disturbance, climate change, may lead to a maximum global loss of 10\u201315% of mangrove forest, but must be considered of secondary importance compared with current average annual rates of 1\u20132% deforestation. A large reservoir of below-ground nutrients, rapid rates of nutrient flux and microbial decomposition, complex and highly efficient biotic controls, self-design and redundancy of keystone species, and numerous feedbacks, all contribute to mangrove resilience to various types of disturbance.", "Transport of persistent organic pollutants by microplastics in estuarine conditions ": "Microplastics represent an increasing source of anthropogenic contamination in aquatic environments, where they may also act as scavengers and transporters of persistent organic pollutants. As estuaries are amongst the most productive aquatic systems, it is important to understand sorption behaviour and transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by microplastics along estuarine gradients. The effects of salinity sorption equilibrium kinetics on the distribution coefficients (K\n                     \n                        d\n                     ) of phenanthrene (Phe) and 4,4\u2032-DDT, onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and onto polyethylene (PE) were therefore investigated. A salinity gradient representing freshwater, estuarine and marine conditions, with salinities corresponding to 0 (MilliQ water, 690\u00a0\u03bcS/cm), 8.8, 17.5, 26.3 and 35 was used. Salinity had no significant effect on the time required to reach equilibrium onto PVC or PE and neither did it affect desorption rates of contaminants from plastics. Although salinity had no effect on sorption capacity of Phe onto plastics, a slight decrease in sorption capacity was observed for DDT with salinity. Salinity had little effect on sorption behaviour and POP/plastic combination was shown to be a more important factor. Transport of Phe and DDT from riverine to brackish and marine waters by plastic is therefore likely to be much more dependent on the aqueous POP concentration than on salinity. The physical characteristics of the polymer and local environmental conditions (e.g. plastic density, particle residence time in estuaries) will affect the physical transport of contaminated plastics. A transport model of POPs by microplastics under estuarine conditions is proposed. Transport of Phe and DDT by PVC and PE from fresh and brackish water toward fully marine conditions was the most likely net direction for contaminant transport and followed the order: Phe-PE\u00a0>>\u00a0DDT-PVC\u00a0=\u00a0DDT-PE\u00a0>>\u00a0Phe-PVC.", "Transport of microplastics in coastal seas ": "Microplastic pollution of the marine environment has received increasing attention from scientists, the public, and policy makers over the last few years. Marine microplastics predominantly originate near the coast and can remain in the nearshore zone for some time. However, at present, there is little understanding of the fate and transport of microplastics in coastal regions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the physical processes involved in the movement of microplastics from estuaries to the continental shelf. The trajectory and speed of microplastics are controlled by their physical characteristics (density, size, and shape) and ocean dynamic conditions (wind, waves, tides, thermohaline gradients, and the influence of benthic sediments). Microplastic particles can be subjected to beaching, surface drifting, vertical mixing, and biofouling, as well as bed-load and suspended load transport processes, until reaching terminal deposition on beaches, in coastal marshes, in benthic sediments or until they are carried by ocean currents to subtropical convergence zones. The dynamic interaction of released microplastics with the shoreline is regulated by onshore/offshore transport, which is impacted by the source location as well as the geometry, vegetation, tidal regime, and wave direction. Wind and wave conditions dominate surface drifting of buoyant particles through Ekman drift, windage, and Stokes drift mechanisms. Neustic microplastic particles travel in the subsurface because of vertical mixing through wind-driven Langmuir circulation and heat cycling. Increasing accumulation of microplastics in benthic sediments needs to be quantitatively explored in terms of biofouling, deposition, entrainment, and transport dynamics. Further studies are required to understand the following: 1) the primary parameters (e.g., windage, terminal velocity, diffusivity, critical shear stress) that determine microplastic transport in different pathways; 2) dynamic distribution of microplastics in various coastal landscapes (e.g., wetlands, beaches, estuaries, lagoons, barrier islands, depocenters) regulated by hydrodynamic conditions; and 3) interactions between the physical transport processes and biochemical reactions (degradation, flocculation, biofouling, ingestions).", "Extraction, enumeration and identification methods for monitoring microplastics in the environment ": "There is much research on the occurrence, pollution characteristics and impacts of microplastics in the marine environment but this omits factors which play important roles in the analysis of microplastics. This review summarizes the methods and techniques in the extraction from sediment, seawater and organisms, and assesses their advantages and limitations according to different experimental conditions, such as salt solution and reagents added to remove organic matter. Similarly, this overview includes the enumeration methods of microplastics by many kinds of microscopes (e.g. stereomicroscope, fluorescent microscope, scanning electron microscope). Advantages and challenges of using micro-FTIR, ART-FTIR, FPA-FTIR, Pry-GC/MS, and Raman spectroscopy in the identification methods are also discussed. This review suggests that monitoring microplastics needs standardized protocols for extraction, identification and quantification and that further research on the effects of microplastics to human health is needed.", "Retrieval of nearshore bathymetry from Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites in South Florida coastal waters ": "This study examines the relatively high-resolution MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2A and 2B for generating bathymetric maps through a ratio transform model in South Florida (United States). Atmospheric correction of imagery is implemented though ACOLITE software, providing accurate performance and consistency over different Sentinel-2A/B scenes and three different study sites. Vertical calibration uses 5\u201310 points collected from digital charts, independent of lidar surveys, which are used for validation and error analysis. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has Median Absolute Error (MedAE) of 0.5\u202fm in West Palm Beach (at depths ranging between 0 and 18\u202fm, limit of lidar survey for validation), 0.4\u202fm in Key West (0\u20135\u202fm), and 0.22\u202fm in Dry Tortugas (0\u20136\u202fm), in conditions with low turbidity. Accurate bathymetry mapping can be accomplished with both sensors over environments with varying water transparency conditions, with the advantage of a fast, flexible, and economical solution. The 10-m MSI can capture small-scale features, such as tidal channels, straits relevant to navigation or steep slopes. While the least error is achieved by calibrating each image separately, a generic calibration produces only a moderately greater error with MedAE still \u223c1m, indicating the robustness of the approach. The research highlights the great potential of the 5-day revisit, suggesting that the twin Sentinel-2 mission of the Copernicus programme may enhance SDB to leverage its use for several operational purposes, particularly in remote and inaccessible regions of the world.", "Hydrodynamic modelling of tidal-fluvial flows in a large river estuary ": "The transition between riverine and estuarine environments is characterised by a change from unidirectional to bidirectional flows, in a region referred to herein as the Tidally-Influenced Fluvial Zone (TIFZ). In order to improve our understanding of the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of this zone, we present a combined field and numerical modelling study of the Columbia River Estuary (CRE), USA, tidally-influenced fluvial zone. The CRE is large measuring 40\u202fkm in length and between 5 and 10\u202fkm wide. A shallow water model (Delft3D) was applied in both 2D and 3D configurations and model sensitivity to the key process parameterizations was investigated. Our results indicate that a 2D model constrained within the estuary can sufficiently reproduce depth-averaged flow within the TIFZ of a stratified estuary.\n                  Model results highlight the interactions between tidal-, fluvial- and topographic-forcing that result in depth dependent tidal rectification, and thus zones of residual sediment transport that: i) may be flood-directed along shallow channel margins and in the lee of bars, and simultaneously ii) is ebb-directed within deeper channel thalwegs. This condition is enhanced at lower discharges, but increased fluvial discharge reduces the number and size of regions with net flood-directed sediment transport and flow. These sediment transport patterns provide a mechanism to extend the bar/island topography downstream, and generate flood-directed, ebb-directed, and symmetrical bedforms, all within the same channel. Analysis of the model data reveals flood-directed sediment transport is due to both tidal variability and mean flow. These results highlight the need to include the mean flow component (M0) when considering the long-term morphodynamic evolution in a TIFZ.", "Integration of fisheries into marine spatial planning: Quo vadis? ": "The relationship between fisheries and marine spatial planning (MSP) is still widely unsettled. While several scientific studies highlight the strong relation between fisheries and MSP, as well as ways in which fisheries could be included in MSP, the actual integration of fisheries into MSP often fails. In this article, we review the state of the art and latest progress in research on various challenges in the integration of fisheries into MSP. The reviewed studies address a wide range of integration challenges, starting with techniques to analyse where fishermen actually fish, assessing the drivers for fishermen's behaviour, seasonal dynamics and long-term spatial changes of commercial fish species under various anthropogenic pressures along their successive life stages, the effects of spatial competition on fisheries and projections on those spaces that might become important fishing areas in the future, and finally, examining how fisheries could benefit from MSP. This paper gives an overview of the latest developments on concepts, tools, and methods. It becomes apparent that the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish and fisheries, as well as the definition of spatial preferences, remain major challenges, but that an integration of fisheries is already possible today.", "A review of sediment diversion in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain ": "One of the proposed methods for restoring the disappearing Mississippi Delta is sediment diversion which uses channels and structures to divert water and sediment from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers into adjacent basins. This study presents a comprehensive review of geological and physical aspects of sediment dynamics in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain (MRDP), with special reference to diversion studies over the past two decades. We synthesize these studies, present the current understanding of sediment diversions in the context of sediment dynamics, identify multiple key knowledge gaps, and make recommendations for future studies.\n                  To maximize net land building in the MRDP, management strategies should be focused on (a) enhancing river sediment delivery (both mud and sand), (b) increasing sediment retention in receiving basins and (c) minimizing erosion in bays and estuaries. Compared with extensive studies of land building, there have been relatively fewer studies of erosional processes. A heterogeneous coastal geological framework, cohesive sediment erodibility and subsidence together play complicated yet critical roles in future sediment dynamics in bays and estuaries of the MRDP. Sediment retention rates are highly sensitive to spatial and temporal scales, types of sediments and delivery season. Sediment diversions to seaward receiving basins provide more surge protection but tend to have lower sediment retention due to active coastal processes. Structures and devices that improve sediment retention, trap sediments, dissipate waves, and build living shorelines should be explored and cost-to-benefit analysis is needed. Long-term planning should consider more landward diversions, strategic community relocation, and nonlinear response of the complex sedimentary system of the MRDP.", "Parasite contamination of berries: Risk, occurrence, and approaches for mitigation ": "Fresh fruits and vegetables, including berries, are essential components of a healthy diet and are relevant in the prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Associations between diet and health are becoming an increasing focus of consumers, and, in response, consumption of fresh berries has been increasing rapidly in recent decades. However, increased consumption of berries may be associated with an increased risk of acquiring foodborne infections, including parasites. In this review, we describe how parasite contamination of berries may occur at several points on the farm-to-fork pathway, starting from the use of contaminated water for irrigation and pesticide application, and contact with animal and human faeces during cultivation, through contaminated harvesting equipment, and including unhygienic practices of berry pickers in the production field or others handling berries prior to consumption. Parasite transmission stages tend to be robust and therefore likely to survive from contamination in the field, through the various stages of harvesting, packaging, and sale, until consumption. We describe outbreaks of parasitic disease associated with consumption of berries \u2013 so far only described for Cyclospora and Trypanosoma cruzi, both of which are briefly introduced \u2013 but also show from survey data summarised in this review that sporadic infections or undetected outbreaks associated with contaminated berries may also occur. In addition, we describe methods for assessing whether berries are contaminated with parasite transmission stages, with emphasis on the challenges associated with analysing this particular matrix. Emphasis on current possibilities for mitigation and control are addressed; avoidance of contamination and implementation of good management practices and a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) approach are essential.", "International Commission on Trichinellosis: Recommendations for quality assurance in digestion testing programs for Trichinella\n             ": "Effective performance of digestion testing methods for Trichinella, and their use for the detection of infected animals and the prevention of human trichinellosis require system-wide incorporation of appropriate quality assurance (QA) practices. The recommendations of the International Commission on Trichinellosis (ICT) aim to facilitate reliable test results when laboratories operate within a quality management system (QMS) which includes: 1) a quality manual (or similar documentation of the QMS); 2) a validated test method with identified critical control points; 3) a training program; 4) procedures utilizing proficiency testing and other methods to confirm technical capability of analysts; 5) equipment calibration and maintenance; 6) standard operating procedures, related documentation and reporting; 7) procedures to enable continuous monitoring and improvements; and 8) regular internal and third party audits. The quality manual or similar documentation describes the QMS within a testing laboratory, and lists the QA policies and good laboratory practices. Quality assurance goals contained in such documentation are the foundation of an effective QA program and must be explicit, measurable, and expressed in terms of performance criteria for the test method based on purpose for testing. The digestion method is capable of consistently detecting Trichinella larvae in meat at a level of sensitivity that is recognized to be effective for use in controlling animal infection and preventing human disease. However, consistent performance of the assay is assured only when parameters of the test method have been defined, scientifically validated as fit for purpose, and used within an effective QMS. The essential components of a digestion assay, specifically the critical control points and minimum standards for test performance are described. Reliable proficiency samples and their appropriate use in a quality system are key factors for certifying and maintaining an effective testing laboratory, including qualifying, re-qualifying and disqualifying of analysts as appropriate. Thus recommendations are included for the preparation and use of proficiency samples in a Trichinella digestion testing laboratory. The minimum training requirements for analysts performing a quality assured digestion assay, as well as suggested requirements for the content of a training manual, are also outlined. Finally, these ICT recommendations include essential components and minimum standards for maintaining and achieving certification and maintenance of a laboratory performing digestion testing for Trichinella. The certification program for the laboratory, including qualifying analysts, may be administered by a National Reference Laboratory or an authorized third party certifying body, under the auspices of the appropriate competent authority.", "Environmental transmission of Toxoplasma gondii: Oocysts in water, soil and food ": "Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite that can cause morbidity and mortality in humans, domestic animals, and terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. The environmentally robust oocyst stage of T. gondii is fundamentally critical to the parasite's success, both in terms of its worldwide distribution as well as the extensive range of infected intermediate hosts. Despite the limited definitive host species (domestic and wild felids), infections have been reported on every continent, and in terrestrial as well as aquatic environments. The remarkable resistance of the oocyst wall enables dissemination of T. gondii through watersheds and ecosystems, and long-term persistence in diverse foods such as shellfish and fresh produce. Here, we review the key attributes of oocyst biophysical properties that confer their ability to disseminate and survive in the environment, as well as the epidemiological dynamics of oocyst sources including domestic and wild felids. This manuscript further provides a comprehensive review of the pathways by which T. gondii oocysts can infect animals and people through the environment, including in contaminated foods, water or soil. We conclude by identifying critical control points for reducing risk of exposure to oocysts as well as opportunities for future synergies and new directions for research aimed at reducing the burden of oocyst-borne toxoplasmosis in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.", "Treatment of toxoplasmosis: Current options and future perspectives ": "Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide parasitic disease infecting about one third of humans, with possible severe outcomes in neonates and immunocompromised patients. Despite continuous and successful efforts to improve diagnosis, therapeutic schemes have barely evolved since many years. This article aims at reviewing the main clinical trials and current treatment practices, and at addressing future perspectives in the light of ongoing researches.", "\n               Toxoplasma gondii infection and toxoplasmosis in farm animals: Risk factors and economic impact ": "The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic parasite that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Felids, including domestic cats, are definitive hosts that can shed oocysts with their feces. In addition to infections that occur by accidental oral uptake of food or water contaminated with oocysts, it is assumed that a large proportion of affected humans may have become infected by consuming meat or other animal products that contained infective parasitic stages of T. gondii. Since farm animals represent a direct source of infection for humans, but also a possible reservoir for the parasite, it is important to control T. gondii infections in livestock. Moreover, T. gondii may also be pathogenic to livestock where it could be responsible for considerable economic losses in some regions and particular farming systems, e.g. in areas where the small ruminant industry is relevant.\n                  This review aims to summarize actual knowledge on the prevalence and effects of infections with T. gondii in the most important livestock species and on the effects of toxoplasmosis on livestock. It also provides an overview on potential risk factors favoring infections of livestock with T. gondii. Knowledge on potential risk factors is prerequisite to implement effective biosecurity measures on farms to prevent T. gondii infections. Risk factors identified by many studies are cat-related, but also those associated with a potential contamination of fodder or water, and with access to a potentially contaminated environment. Published information on the costs T. gondii infections cause in livestock production, is scarce. The most recent peer reviewed reports from Great Britain and Uruguay suggest annual cost of about 5\u201315 million US $ per country. Since these estimates are outdated, future studies are needed to estimate the present costs due to toxoplasmosis in livestock. Further, the fact that T. gondii infections in livestock may affect human health needs to be considered and the respective costs should also be estimated, but this is beyond the scope of this article.", "Effects of anisakid nematodes Anisakis simplex (s.l.), Pseudoterranova decipiens (s.l.) and Contracaecum osculatum (s.l.) on fish and consumer health ": "The anisakid nematodes Anisakis simplex (Rudolphi, 1809), Pseudoterranova decipiens (Krabbe, 1878) and Contracaecum osculatum (Rudolphi, 1802) occur as third-stage larvae in marine fish products and may infect consumers ingesting raw or under-cooked fish products. Clinical symptoms associated with the infection, termed anisakidosis, vary from irritation of the oesophagus and stomach, via nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea to severe epigastric and abdominal pain. Third-stage larvae of A. simplex are found in the body cavity, musculature and various organs, P. decipiens occur mainly in the fish musculature (fillet) and C. osculatum larvae reside predominantly in the liver, body cavity, mesenteries and pyloric caeca. Preventive measures, including mechanical removal of worms, heat treatment or freezing to kill worms, are needed in order to reduce the risk of human infections. The anisakid life cycle involves several hosts. A. simplex nematodes use cetaceans (whales) as final hosts whereas P. decipiens and C. osculatum have their adult stage in pinnipeds (seals). Eggs released by worms in these hosts pass with feces to seawater where free-living third-stage larvae hatch from the eggs. Various invertebrates \u2013 including euphausiids, copepods and amphipods \u2013 feed on these larvae, become infected and serve as intermediate hosts. A range of fish species may serve as transport hosts following ingestion of infected invertebrates and the final stage develops after two additional moults in the stomach of marine mammals which consumed infected fish. Control measures may be implemented to reduce infections of fish stocks and thereby risk of human infections.", "Toxoplasmosis: Overview from a One Health perspective ": "Toxoplasmosis is paradigmatic of the One Health approach, as the causative parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans. This makes T. gondii one of the most successful parasites on earth, infecting up to a third of the global human population. Moreover, the T. gondii disease burden has been ranked among the highest of all parasitic diseases. To reduce the disease burden of toxoplasmosis in humans, interventions are needed in the animal reservoirs, necessitating close collaboration between both the human and veterinary medical sectors. In the present special issue of FAWPAR, several of the most pertinent topics related to the impact and control of toxoplasmosis are addressed by leading experts in the field. This collection of papers highlights state-of-the-art knowledge, gaps in knowledge and future perspectives, as well as the benefits of current and proposed future activities to tackle toxoplasmosis within the One Health context.", "\n               Cryptosporidium \u2014 What is it? ": "Cryptosporidium is a ubiquitous enteric protozoan pathogen of vertebrates, and although recognised as a cause of disease in humans and domestic animals for over 50years, fundamental questions concerning its biology and ecology have only recently been resolved. Overwhelming data now confirm that, like its close relatives, Cryptosporidium is a facultatively epicellular apicomplexan that is able to multiply in a host cell-free environment. These data must be considered in the context of the phylogenetic reclassification of Cryptosporidium from a coccidian to a gregarine. Together, they dictate an urgent need to reconsider the biology and behaviour of Cryptosporidium, and perhaps help to explain the parasite's incredible genetic diversity, distribution and host range. Improved imaging technologies have complemented phylogenetic studies in demonstrating the parasite's affinities with gregarine protozoa and have further supported its extracellular developmental capability and potential role as an environmental pathogen. These advances in our understanding of Cryptosporidium as a protozoan pathogen are examined with emphasis on how they may influence control strategies in the future.", "Fish-borne, zoonotic cestodes (Diphyllobothrium and relatives) in cold climates: A never-ending story of neglected and (re)-emergent parasites ": "Fish-borne cestodes capable of infecting humans are represented almost exclusively by so called broad tapeworms, i.e. members of the order Diphyllobothriidea. These large-sized human tapeworms have three host life-cycles, in which teleost fishes (except in the case of Spirometra) play a role of the second intermediate hosts and represent a source of human infection. Although the broad fish tapeworms (genera Adenocephalus, Diphyllobothrium and Diplogonoporus) have been recognized as human parasites for a long time, many aspects of their biology and epidemiology, including species composition of individual genera, their clinical relevance and geographical distribution have been noticeably understudied. The overriding obstacle preventing clarification of the diversity, origin and host-associations of diphyllobothriids is the poor state of systematics of the group. Even though diphyllobothriosis itself is not a life-threatening disease, it is considered the most important fish-borne zoonosis caused by a cestode with up to 20million people estimated to be infected worldwide, with an affinity to colder climates including subarctic and arctic areas of the North and partly South Hemisphere. Moreover, several species seem to (re)-emerge in the most developed countries. Current (re)-emergence of diphyllobothriosis and the introduction of its agents into new geographical regions are mainly fuelled by: (i) increased preference of human societies to consume raw food, (ii) globalized trade with fish products, (iii) human migration. Dozens of nominal species have been described so far, but only 15 species currently recognized as valid have been reported to infect humans. Moreover, the validity of species described from Alaska, which have been reported from man (Diphyllobothrium alascense, D. dalliae, D. ursi) should be confirmed using molecular data. Yet, we still lack information about the intraspecific variability and species boundaries of the most important broad tapeworm species including those occurring in cold climates, such as Diphyllobothrium latum, D. dendriticum and D. nihonkaiense. Moreover, molecular data indicate paraphyly of the genus Diphyllobothrium, which may explain different host associations and morphology of species in distantly related lineages. For the first time in the literature, data on all human-infecting broad fish tapeworms, most of which occur in cold climates, are summarized, with focus on rare or uncommon species that were largely neglected in the literature or appeared in hardly accessible papers.", "A one health approach to vaccines against Toxoplasma gondii\n             ": "Summary\n               \n                  Toxoplasmosis is a serious disease with global impact, now recognised as one of the most important food borne diseases worldwide and a major cause of production loss in livestock. A one health approach to develop a vaccination programme to tackle toxoplasmosis is an attractive and realistic prospect. Knowledge of disease epidemiology, parasite transmission routes and main risk groups has helped to target key host species and outcomes for a vaccine programme and these would be to prevent/reduce congenital disease in women and sheep; prevent/reduce T. gondii tissue cysts in food animal species and to prevent/reduce T. gondii oocyst shedding in cats. Most animals, including humans, develop good protective immunity following infection, involving cell mediated immune responses, which may explain why live vaccines are generally more effective to protect against T. gondii. Recent advances in our knowledge of parasite genetics and gene manipulation, strain variation, key antigenic epitopes, delivery systems and induction of immune responses are all contributing to the prospects of developing new vaccines which may be more widely applicable. A key area in progressing vaccine development is to devise standard vaccine efficacy models in relevant animal hosts and this is where a one health approach bringing together researchers across different disciplines can be of major benefit. The tools and technologies are in place to make a real impact in tackling toxoplasmosis using vaccination and it just requires a collective will to make it happen.", "Diversity of Toxoplasma gondii strains at the global level and its determinants ": "The population structure of Toxoplasma gondii is characterized by contrasting geographic patterns of strain diversity at different spatial scales: global, regional and even local scales in some regions. The determinants of this diversity pattern and its possible evolutionary mechanisms are still largely unexplored. This review will focus on three main dichotomies observed in the population structure of the parasite: (1) domestic versus wild, (2) South America versus the rest of the world and (3) intercontinental clonal lineages versus regional or local clonal lineages. Here, the impact in terms of public health of this remarkably contrasting geographic diversity of T. gondii populations is discussed, with emphasis on the role of globalization of exchanges that could lead to rapid evolution of T. gondii population spatial structure and new challenges in a One Health context.", "Molecular epidemiologic tools for waterborne pathogens Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis\n             ": "Molecular diagnostic tools have played an important role in improving our understanding of the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis, which are two of the most important waterborne parasites in industrialized nations. Genotyping tools are frequently used in the identification of host-adapted Cryptosporidium species and G. duodenalis assemblages, allowing the assessment of infection sources in humans and public health potential of parasites found in animals and the environment. In contrast, subtyping tools are more often used in case linkages, advanced tracking of infections sources, and assessment of disease burdens attributable to anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission. More recently, multilocus typing tools have been developed for population genetic characterizations of transmission dynamics and delineation of mechanisms for the emergence of virulent subtypes. With the recent development in next generation sequencing techniques, whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis are increasingly used in characterizing Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis. The use of these tools in epidemiologic studies has identified significant differences in the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. in humans between developing countries and industrialized nations, especially the role of zoonotic transmission in human infection. Geographic differences are also present in the distribution of G. duodenalis assemblages A and B in humans. In contrast, there is little evidence for widespread zoonotic transmission of giardiasis in both developing and industrialized countries. Differences in virulence have been identified among Cryptosporidium species and subtypes, and possibly between G. duodenalis assemblages A and B, and genetic recombination has been identified as one mechanism for the emergence of virulent C. hominis subtypes. These recent advances are providing insight into the epidemiology of waterborne protozoan parasites in both developing and developed countries.", "Prevention and mitigation of congenital toxoplasmosis. Economic costs and benefits in diverse settings ": "Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT), the result of a primary infection of pregnant women with Toxoplasma gondii which was transmitted to the fetus, may result in mild to deep injuries occurring in the newborn or later in its development or in adolescence. The visual and cognitive impairment that can result imposes substantial economic costs on the individual and society. Numerous observational studies favor the conclusion that, with preventive measures currently available, it is possible to reduce the incidence of infections in pregnant women, the incidence of fetal infection by preventing transplacental transmission, and the gravity of injury in infected newborns. Treatment of infected newborns can also reduce the severity of consequences and the frequency of their occurrence later in life. Prevention programs, however, are applied in only a few countries; in most countries implementation of a national prevention program has not been considered or has been thought to be too expensive. This article lists the methods of prevention of CT and describes existing national prevention programs in France and Austria. It analyzes the economic costs and benefits of maternal screening for CT prevention and mitigation for society and for health systems. The economic feasibility of implementing national screening in low-prevalence, high-cost countries is illustrated with the example of the United States. New diagnostic tools are discussed and the implication of lower costs is considered, for countries with well-established screening programs as well as those with inadequate prenatal care networks.", "Fishborne zoonotic heterophyid infections: An update ": "Fishborne heterophyid trematodes infecting humans are at least 29 species worldwide and belong to 13 genera. Its global burden is much more than 7 million infected people. They include Metagonimus (M. yokogawai, M. takahashii, M. miyatai, M. minutus, and M. katsuradai), Heterophyes (H. heterophyes, H. nocens, H. dispar, and H. aequalis), Haplorchis (H. taichui, H. pumilio, H. yokogawai, and H. vanissimus), Pygidiopsis (P. summa and P. genata), Heterophyopsis (H. continua), Stellantchasmus (S. falcatus), Centrocestus (C. formosanus, C. armatus, C. cuspidatus, and C. kurokawai), Stictodora (S. fuscata and S. lari), Procerovum (P. varium and P. calderoni), Acanthotrema (A. felis), Apophallus (A. donicus), Ascocotyle (A. longa), and Cryptocotyle (C. lingua). Human infections are scattered around the world but the major endemic areas are located in Southeast Asia. The source of human infection is ingestion of raw or improperly cooked fish. The pathogenicity, host-parasite relationships, and clinical manifestations in each species infection are poorly understood; these should be elucidated particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Problems exist in the differential diagnosis of these parasitic infections because of close morphological similarity of eggs in feces and unavailability of alternative methods such as serology. Molecular diagnostic techniques are promising but they are still at an infant stage. Praziquantel has been proved to be highly effective against most of the patients infected with heterophyid flukes. Epidemiological surveys and detection of human infections are required for better understanding of the geographical distribution and global burden of each heterophyid species. In this review, the most updated knowledge on the morphology, biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and pathology, immunology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment, and prevention and control of fishborne zoonotic heterophyid infections is provided.", "The importance of being parasiticidal\u2026 an update on drug development for the treatment of alveolar echinococcosis ": "The lethal disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by the metacestode stage of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Current chemotherapeutical treatment of AE relies on albendazole and mebendazole, with the caveat that these compounds are not parasiticidal. Drugs have to be taken for a prolonged period of time, often life-long, which can cause adverse effects and reduces the patients' quality of life. In some individuals, benzimidazoles are inactive or cause toxicity, leading to treatment discontinuation. Alternatives to benzimidazoles are urgently needed. Over the recent years, in vivo and in vitro models for low-to-medium throughput drug discovery against AE have been set in place. In vitro drug tests include the phosphoglucose-isomerase (PGI) assay to measure physical damage induced to metacestodes, and viability assays to assess parasiticidal activity against metacestodes and stem cells. In vitro models are also employed for studies on mechanisms of action. In vivo models are thus far based on rodents, mainly mice, and benefits could be gained in future by comparative approaches in naturally infected dogs or captive monkeys.\n                  For the identification of novel drugs against AE, a rare disease with a low expected market return, drug-repurposing is the most promising strategy. A variety of chemically synthesized compounds as well as natural products have been analyzed with respect to in vitro and/or in vivo activities against AE. We here review and discuss the most active of these compounds including anti-infective compounds (benzimidazoles, nitazoxanide, amphotericin B, itraconazole, clarithromycin, DB1127, and buparvaquone), the anti-infective anti-malarials (artemisinin, ozonids, mefloquine, and MMV665807) and anti-cancer drugs (isoflavones, 2-methoxyestradiol, methotrexate, navelbine, vincristine, kinase inhibitors, metallo-organic ruthenium complexes, bortezomib, and taxanes). Taking into account the efficacy as well as the potential availability for patients, the most promising candidates are new formulations of benzimidazoles and mefloquine. Future drug-repurposing approaches should also target the energy metabolism of E. multilocularis, in particular the understudied malate dismutation pathway, as this offers an essential target in the parasite, which is not present in mammals.", "A One Health systematic review of diagnostic tools for Echinococcus multilocularis surveillance: Towards equity in global detection ": "Echinococcus multilocularis is a zoonotic cestode of canid definitive hosts that is emerging as a parasite of medical and veterinary concern in regions of North America, Europe and Asia. Infection with the metacestode stage (alveolar echinococcosis \u2013 AE) is life-threatening, especially for patients who reside in low resource countries and lack access to modern diagnostic tests and treatments. The overall objectives of this One Health review were to systematically describe the diagnostic tests currently employed in endemic countries to detect E. multilocularis in people, canids and the environment, and to report the test characteristics of new diagnostic techniques for population surveillance. In this systematic review of English and Chinese language databases, we identified 92 primary records of E. multilocularis surveillance in canids (N\u202f=\u202f75), humans (N\u202f=\u202f20) and/or the environment (food, soil; N\u202f=\u202f3) and 12 grey literature records that reported E. multilocularis surveillance or health systems protocols between 2008 and 2018. Surveillance for E. multilocularis was conducted using a broad range of combined morphological, molecular, immunological and imaging techniques. Nine studies reporting diagnostic evaluations for cestode or metacestode detection were identified, including studies on copro-antigen ELISA, copro-PCR, intestinal examination, Western Blot, magnetic capture RT-PCR and immunochromatography. Our dataset includes prevalence estimates for E. multilocularis in canids, people, or environment in 27 of the 43 endemic countries and reports data gaps in surveillance, laboratory methods, and diagnostic sensitivity. International consensus on gold standard diagnostic techniques and harmonization of human, canid and environmental surveillance data across political boundaries are needed to comprehensively assess the global burden and distribution of this parasite.", "First description of Giardia duodenalis in buffalo calves (Bubalus bubalis) in southwest region of S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil ": "We performed molecular characterization of Giardia duodenalis in buffalo calves from the Southwest region of S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. A total of 183 fecal samples of Murrah breed buffaloes up to six months of age were collected. We examined these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene and positive samples were characterized using additional PCR assays targeting a portion of the beta-giardin, the glutamate dehydrogenase and the triose-phosphate isomerase genes. Based on the SSU rRNA nPCR, the presence of G. duodenalis was confirmed in 12 (6.56%) of fecal samples, of these, five, four and three samples were positive for the tpi, bg and gdh genes, respectively. Assemblage identification by sequencing was successful in 6 of 12 samples and sequence analysis showed 100% genetic similarity with G. duodenalis assemblage E. This observation represents the first detection of G. duodenalis assemblage E in buffaloes calves in Brazil.", "Low salt exposure results in inactivation of Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoites during formulation of dry cured ready-to-eat pork sausage ": "The production of safe and healthy food products represents one of the main objectives of the food industry. The presence of microorganisms in meat and products containing meat can result in a range of human health problems, as well as economic losses to producers of these products. However, contaminated meat products continue to initiate serious and large-scale outbreaks of disease in consumers. In addition to outbreaks of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, parasitic organisms, such as Toxoplasma gondii, are responsible for foodborne infections worldwide, and in the case of T. gondii, is considered the 2nd leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S. Transmission of Toxoplasma gondii has historically been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked meat products, including pork. Specific concerns with respect to pork products are ready-to-eat (RTE) pork meals. These are pork or products containing pork that are prepared by curing or drying, and are not intended to be cooked before being consumed.\n                  Previous studies have demonstrated that T. gondii is inactivated during dry cured sausage preparation, apparently in the batter during fermentation. In this study, we have analyzed timing of inactivation of T. gondii in freshly prepared pepperoni batter to confirm our previous findings, to determine how quickly inactivation occurs during fermentation, and to confirm what parameters of the sausage preparation are involved in inactivation of the parasite. Results from the current and previous study indicate that rapid inactivation of T. gondii bradyzoites occurs in low salt batter for dry cured sausage within 4\u202fh of initiation of fermentation.", "Diagnostic and follow-up performance of serological tests for different forms/courses of alveolar echinococcosis ": "Diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is predominantly based on imaging procedures combined with immunodiagnostic testing. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the performance of four serological tests (EgHF-ELISA, Em2-ELISA, recEm18-ELISA and Em-Immunoblotting) for initial diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of AE patients. Overall, 101 AE patients were included, grouped according to treatment options and immune status as follows: (A) curative surgical treatment (n\u202f=\u202f45 patients), (B) non-radical or palliative surgical treatment (n\u202f=\u202f11), (C) benzimidazoles only (n\u202f=\u202f20), (D) immunocompromised with radical surgical treatment (n\u202f=\u202f11), (E) immunocompromised with benzimidazoles only (n\u202f=\u202f4), and finally a group of 10 AE patients (F) that were considered to present so-called \u201cabortive\u201d lesions. Initial (i.e. pretreatment) ELISA-based diagnosis for patients in groups A to E revealed overall diagnostic sensitivities of 95% for EgHF, 86% for Em2, and 80% for recEm18, respectively. Comparatively, the diagnostic sensitivity of Em-Immunoblotting was higher with an overall value of 98%. In group F, only Em-Immunoblotting had an excellent diagnostic sensitivity (100%), whereas the ELISAs had poor sensitivities of 30% (EgHF- and Em2-ELISA) or even 0% (recEm18-ELISA).\n                  Serological monitoring of AE patients showed a clear association between a curative development of disease (induced either by surgery or benzimidazole medication) and a negativization in the ELISAs. This effect was most pronounced for the recEm18-ELISA, where 56% negativized following diagnosis/treatment, as compared to 36% for the EgHF-ELISA, and 37% for the Em2-ELISA, respectively. After radical surgery, the mean time until negativization in the recEm18-ELISA was 2.4\u202fyears (SD 1.6). This was significantly shorter than the mean 3.9\u202fyears (SD 2.5) in those AE patients with non-radical, palliative surgery or ABZ treatment who were able to negativize during the study period (p\u202f=\u202f0.048).\n                  Conclusively, Em-Immunoblotting appears as the most sensitive test to diagnose active as well as inactive (\u201cabortive\u201d) AE-cases. The inclusion of the ELISAs completes the initial diagnostic picture and offers valuable additional information. Conversely, recEm18-ELISA appears as the currently best serological tool to monitor a regressive and putatively curative course of AE in treated patients.", "Surgery versus conservative drug therapy in alveolar echinococcosis patients in Germany \u2013 A health-related quality of life comparison ": "Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a rare zoonosis caused by the parasite Echinococcus multilocularis. Nothing is known about the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with AE receiving different types of therapy. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare HRQoL in patients with AE in Germany depending on their therapeutic regimen namely conservative drug treatment with long-term benzimidazoles versus surgical therapy by resection of the parasitic liver lesions. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire, including other echinococcosis-related questions, was used to measure HRQoL. The SF-36 scales were evaluated according to the algorithms provided by the authors. The statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 9.2. The significance level was set at \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.05, p\u202f<\u202f0.05 corresponds to statistical significance. The investigated group consisted of conservatively drug treated (n\u202f=\u202f30) and patients with curative surgery (n\u202f=\u202f25) with confirmed AE. The study was performed at an infectious disease outpatient department from April 2018 to October 2018. The conservatively drug treated patient group consisted of 15 men (50.0%) and 15 women (50.0%) with an average age of 55.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f16.7\u202fyears (Median: 59). The surgery group consisted of nine men (36.0%) and 16 women (64.3%) with an average age of 53.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f31.9\u202fyears (Median: 54). The physical quality of life of the conservatively drug treated patients did not show any significant differences to the surgical treated group (45.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.4 vs. 47.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.9; p\u202f=\u202f0.4079). There was also no significant difference regarding the mental quality of life between the conservatively drug treated patients, and those treated with curative surgery (45.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.6 vs. 47.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.8; 0.5206). Nevertheless, there was a slight advantage in the physical and mental scores of the patients treated with surgery. Furthermore, for 13 of the 25 surgically treated patients, some aspects of the HRQoL improved significantly after surgery.\n                  The evaluation showed no statistically significant differences in HRQoL in patients with AE dependent on the applied treatment strategy (conservative drug versus curative surgical therapy).", "Recent advancements in the control of Taenia solium: A systematic review ": "The combined health and economic impact of Taenia solium urges for control and, if possible, elimination of this neglected parasitic zoonosis. Up till now there is still no consensus about the most cost-effective and feasible approaches for control. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and summarize the evidence in English scientific literature on the control and elimination of T. solium since 2014, based on the rapidly evolving field of evidence on control and elimination of T. solium. The search resulted in the identification of 458 records of which 31 were included, covering 13 field trials and 18 articles containing experimental data, mathematical models, and other information directly relevant the control of T. solium.\n                  Recent field studies confirm that combinations of interventions or multiple rounds are more successful in obtaining rapid reductions in transmission and parasite occurrence, with the quick impact of the combination of human and pig treatment confirmed in a South Asian and Peruvian context. Moreover, elimination of transmission through a one-year intensive program, combining human and pig treatment/vaccination was described in a Peruvian study. Recent studies also provide more data on the positive impact of specific health education, as well as newly developed electronic educational tools, providing opportunities for area specific community-engaged participatory interventions.\n                  Once control has been achieved, monitoring of migration of both potentially infected people and pigs from outside the control area is important for sustained disease control.", "Comparison of tissues (heart vs. brain) and serological tests (MAT, ELISA and IFAT) for detection of Toxoplasma gondii in naturally infected wolverines (Gulo gulo) from the Yukon, Canada ": "Toxoplasmosis is an important parasitic zoonosis worldwide. Many human and animal surveys use serological assays based on Toxoplasma gondii antibody detection in serum, a matrix that is not routinely available from wildlife. Commonly used serological assays have rarely been validated for use with fluids other than serum, nor validated for their performance in wildlife species. New molecular assays, such as magnetic capture DNA extraction and real-time PCR (MC-qPCR), offer high sensitivity for detection of T. gondii DNA in tissues. The aims of this study were to (1) assess prevalence of T. gondii DNA based on MC-qPCR detection in brain and heart of naturally infected wolverines (Gulo gulo) from the Yukon, Canada (2) compare two matrices [heart fluid (collected from thawed heart) and filter eluate (eluted from blood soaked filter paper)] for antibody detection in the same species, and (3) evaluate the performance of three serological tests [modified agglutination test (MAT), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT)] to detect naturally infected wolverines as determined by MC-qPCR. DNA of T. gondii was detected in heart and/or brain in 16 of 68 wolverines (24%, 95% CI: 15.0\u201334.8). Tissue prevalence and infection intensity was higher in heart [16 positives, mediantachyzoites equivalents per gram (TEG) =1221] compared to brain (10 positives, median TEG\u202f=\u202f347). Heart fluid (HF) and filter eluates (FE) performed equally well in ELISA and IFAT in terms of relative sensitivity, but HF performed better with MAT. ELISA and IFAT had higher relative sensitivity (94%) and relative specificity (100%) compared to MAT (relative sensitivity 75% and relative specificity 92%). Overall, our findings indicate that the parasite burden in naturally infected wolverines was higher in heart compared to brain, heart fluid performed better than filter paper eluate for serological testing using MAT, and both IFAT and ELISA had higher relative sensitivity, relative specificity, and accuracy compared to MAT.", "Curing conditions to inactivate Trichinella spiralis muscle larvae in ready-to-eat pork sausage ": "Curing processes are one method by which pork products, which are considered ready to eat (RTE) and have not been otherwise tested or treated, can be rendered safe from risk for exposure to Trichinella muscle larvae (ML). Curing processes in the U.S. currently require individual validation of methods to demonstrate inactivation of Trichinella. This is a major undertaking for each process; currently no model of meat chemistry exists that can be correlated with inactivation of Trichinella. Given the potential for new RTE products (e.g., lower salt), the availability of a wider range of tested methods for inactivation of Trichinella in pork would be of substantial value to the industry. In this study, five variables were tested \u2013 salt/brine concentration, water activity (aw), pH, temperature, and time, using low and high endpoints for common curing treatments for dry cured pork sausage. The data demonstrated that NaCl concentrations above 1.3%, in combination with fermentation to pH5.2 or below, resulted in inactivation of >96% of Trichinella ML in stuffed sausages within 24\u201328h. All ML were inactivated by 7\u201310days post-stuffing. These curing processes reliably predict inactivation of Trichinella spiralis, and can be used within the defined upper and lower endpoint parameters to reduce or eliminate the need for individual product validation.", "\n               Echinococcus across the north: Current knowledge, future challenges ": "Zoonotic Echinococcus spp. cestodes are present in almost all circumpolar nations, and have historically posed a risk to health of indigenous as well as other northern residents. However, surveillance data on both alveolar (AE) and cystic (CE) echinococcosis remains incomplete throughout the circumpolar region: Russia, Fennoscandia, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and Alaska (USA). Prevalence of Echinococcus spp. varies considerably in definitive canid hosts, animal intermediate hosts and accidental hosts like humans. Yet despite the high prevalence reported in canids in some geographic locations, human AE and CE are much less common than in endemic Asian and central European countries. This paper explores knowledge gaps and future challenges posed by Echinococcus spp. in eight circumpolar countries, a region where rapid environmental and social change are rewriting the boundaries, transmission, and impact of many pathogens, including zoonotic Echinococcus spp.\n                  Genotypes G6, G8 and G10 of Echinococcus canadensis are causative agents of human CE and have been identified in sylvatic (wild animal) and synanthropic (ecological association with humans) cervid-canine life cycles in the following northern regions: Alaska and northern Canada - G8 and G10; northern Russia - G6, G8, G10; and Fennoscandia - G10 in Finland - with no recent reports from Norway or Sweden. Echinococcus multilocularis, which causes AE, has been identified in a sylvatic arvicoline rodent-canine lifecycle in Alaska, Canada, Russia, Sweden and Svalbard (Norway). Asian, Mongolian, European and North American strains of E. multilocularis are found in Russia, with the North American N1 strain predominating in the north. The N1 strain is also found in Alaska, as well as Svalbard, whilst Asian strains have been identified in western Alaska. Central North American (N2) strain and European-type strains of E. multilocularis are present in Canada. Typing of the strain in Sweden is still pending. Individual human cases of AE with N2 and European-type strains are reported in North America, as well as multiple cases with Asian strains in Russia and historically on St Lawrence Island, Alaska (although genotyping of human cases was not available at the time). Echinococcus spp. have not been detected in Greenland and have been eliminated from Iceland.\n                  The predominance of E. multilocularis N1 strain and E. canadensis genotypes, in regions with high prevalence in definitive hosts yet low incidence of human AE and CE, suggests that these genotypes have lower zoonotic potential and pathogenicity than European and Asian strains of E. multilocularis and livestock genotypes of E granulosus sensu stricto. The continued monitoring of the emergence of Echinococcus genotypes within definitive and intermediate hosts, as well as people, is needed to assess the impact on public health risk, since the introduction of other genotypes could have serious repercussions. Lastly, determining risk factors and source attribution for human cases, including the possibility of food and waterborne transmission and the likelihood of autochthonous transmission, remain challenges.", "International Commission on Trichinellosis: Recommendations on the use of serological tests for the detection of Trichinella infection in animals and humans ": "Serological methods are widely used for detection of infections in animals and humans. The recommendations provided here take into account the best current methods for the serological detection of Trichinella infection. They are based on current scientific information including unpublished data from laboratories with relevant expertise in this field. These recommendations represent the official position of the International Commission on Trichinellosis (ICT) regarding acceptable methods for the use and interpretation of serology testing for Trichinella infection in animals and humans.\n                  The ICT does not recommend use of serological methods for testing individual carcasses of animals at slaughter for assuring food safety. For detection of human infections, for epidemiological studies in animals and humans, and for monitoring Trichinella infection in swine, the ICT recommends ELISA using excretory/secretory (ES) antigens. These antigens are obtained from the in-vitro maintenance of Trichinella spiralis muscle larvae and are recognized by sera from hosts infected by all Trichinella species and genotypes identified thus far. In most situations, positive results obtained by ELISA should be confirmed by western blot. Serological assays should be properly standardized and validated for their intended purpose. The components of the test that are critical for maintaining suitable performance should be identified and appropriately checked. Users of commercial tests should verify that the test has been adequately evaluated by an independent body. Serology is useful for detecting Trichinella in animals and humans but its limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting the results.", "Synthesis and characterization of tridentate phosphine ligands incorporating long methylene chains and ethoxysilane groups for immobilizing molecular rhodium catalysts ": "The new tridentate phosphine ligands EtOSi((CH2)nPPh2)3 and O[Si((CH2)nPPh2)3]2 (n\u202f=\u202f4, 7, 11), as well as their precursor ethoxysilanes EtOSi((CH2)mCH\u202f=\u202fCH2)3 and disiloxanes O[Si((CH2)mCH\u202f=\u202fCH2)3]2 (m\u202f=\u202f2, 5, 9) and EtOSi((CH2)11PPh2RhClCOD)3 (COD\u202f=\u202fcyclooctadiene) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The ethoxysilane- and disiloxane-containing phosphine ligands have been immobilized on silica via covalent siloxane bonds. The immobilized linkers have been characterized by 31P and 29Si CP/MAS and HRMAS NMR spectroscopy. The covalent siloxane bonds between the linkers and the silica surface prevent translational mobility of the phosphines. Immobilized Wilkinson-type Rh hydrogenation catalysts have been obtained by ligand exchange of ClRh(PPh3)3 and ClRhpyCOD (py\u202f=\u202fpyridine) with the surface-bound ligands. The single crystal X-ray structure of ClRhpyCOD has been reported. The activities and lifetimes have been studied for the hydrogenation of 1-dodecene. The new catalysts are highly active and they can be recycled up to 15 times without major loss of activity. Within the first hours of the catalytic reaction the initially molecular complexes form Rh nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution on the surface. The nanoparticles do not leach into the supernatant solution and are not air-sensitive.", "Deoxygenation mechanism of methyl butyrate on HZSM-5: A density functional theory study ": "The catalytic cracking of fatty acid esters is of great importance for the utilization of biomass. Here, the Gibbs energy barriers for the multistep catalytic deoxygenation reaction of methyl butyrate in HZSM-5 zeolite were systematically investigated via density functional theory (DFT). All the rate-determining steps of the different reaction pathways together with the possible reaction intermediates were determined. The optimal preliminary cleavage reaction of methyl butyrate on HZSM-5 zeolite were CH3CH2CH2CO2CH3\u202f\u2192\u202fCH3CH2CH2C+(O)\u202f+\u202fCH3OH and CH3CH2CH2CO2CH3\u202f\u2192\u202fCH3CH2CH2CO2H\u202f+\u202fCH3\n                     +. The initial cleavage products (butyryl carbocation, methanol, and butyric acid) subsequently formed alkanes through a series of dehydration and decarboxylation as well as nucleophilic addition reactions. The butanone intermediate, which was the determining factor for carbon chain growth, tended to form longer carbonyl cations with alkyl alkoxides, followed by decarbonylation reactions. In addition, the difficulty of the nucleophilic addition reaction and decarbonylation reaction depended on the stability of the carbocations in the transition state. The reaction mechanism revealed here may pave the way to the design of highly efficient catalysts for the catalytic cracking of biomass.", "A facile way for sugar transformation catalyzed by carbon-based Lewis-Br\u00f8nsted solid acid ": "In this work, catalytic transformation of sugar into 2-Formyl-5-ethoxymethylfuran (EMF) was studied using Zn-trapped sulfonated carbon (SO3H-Zn-SC) catalyst. The catalyst was easily prepared via impregnation-pyrolysis and sulfonation. The physical and chemical properties of as-prepared catalyst were tested and discussed in details. For upgrading experiment, EMF synthesis from glucose transformation via isomerization, dehydration and etherification processes was performed using ultrasonic system. The increasing of ultrasonic power and ultrasonic duty cycle promoted the formation of EMF product, providing a maximum EMF yield of 97.8%. The ultrasonic application promoted the selectivity for EMF formation at shorter-faster reaction rate. Moreover, SO3H-Zn-SC also exhibited good reusability with low amount of acid leaching in each cycle. This research provided alternative way for improving the yield of EMF at short reaction time.", "Industrial applications of immobilized enzymes\u2014A review ": "The use of immobilized enzymes is now a routine process for the manufacture of many industrial products in the pharmaceutical, chemical and food industry. Some enzymes, such as lipases, are naturally robust and efficient, can be used for the production of many different molecules and have a wide range of industrial applications thanks to their broad selectivity. As an example, lipase from Candida antarctica (CalB) has been used by BASF to produce chiral compounds, such as the herbicide Dimethenamide-P, which was previously made chemically. The use of the immobilized enzyme has provided significant advantages over a chemical process, such as the possibility to use equimolar concentration of substrates, obtain an enantiomeric excess > 99%, use relatively low temperatures (< 60\u202f\u00b0C) in organic solvent, obtain a single enantiomer instead of the racemate as in the chemical process and use a column configuration that allows dramatic increases in productivity. This process would not have been possible without the use of an immobilized enzyme, since it runs in organic solvent [1].\n                  Some more specific enzymes, like transaminases, have required protein engineering to become suitable for applications in production of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) in conditions which are extreme for a wild type enzyme. The process developed by Merck for sitagliptin manufacture is a good example of challenging enzyme engineering applied to API manufacture. The previous process of sitagliptin involved hydrogenation of enamine at high pressure using a rhodium-based chiral catalyst. By developing an engineered transaminase, the enzymatic process was able to convert 200\u202fg/l of prositagliptin in the final product, with e.e. >99.5% and using an immobilized enzyme in the presence of DMSO as a cosolvent [2].\n                  For all enzymes, the possibility to be immobilized and used in a heterogeneous form brings important industrial and environmental advantages, such as simplified downstream processing or continuous process operations. Here, we present a series of large-scale applications of immobilized enzymes with benefits for the food, chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetics and medical device industries, some of which have been scarcely reported on previously.\n                  In general, all enzymatic reactions can benefit from the immobilization, however, the final choice to use them in immobilized form depends on the economic evaluation of costs associated with their use versus benefits obtained in the process. It can be concluded that the benefits are rather significant, since the use of immobilized enzymes in industry is increasing.", "Cellulose conversion to ethylene glycol by tungsten oxide-based catalysts ": "The conversion of cellulose into ethylene glycol remains a significant challenge in the biobased domain. Here we explored the activity of various bulk and mesoporous (doped) tungsten oxides in combination with carbon-supported ruthenium for obtaining ethylene glycol from cellulose. Tungstite and sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxides are more active and selective than monoclinic WO3. Doping tungstite with early transition metals enhanced the rate of cellulose depolymerization to glucose through a higher Br\u00f8nsted acidity, although this did not improve the overall performance as the higher acidity resulted in a higher rate of humin formation. The increased acidity of mesoporous sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxide compared to tungstite had a similar adverse effect. Doping this material with niobium improved ethylene glycol selectivity at similar conversion. Kinetic studies showed that the majority of ethylene glycol is produced in the first hour for three optimized catalysts, with undoped bulk tungstite being the most efficient catalytic material. Impregnation of these materials with ruthenium instead of using carbon-supported ruthenium as a co-catalyst was most beneficial for tungstite, as it showed improved ethylene glycol selectivity and lower polyol yields after 1\u2009h of reaction time.", "Schiff base Cu(I) catalyst for aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols ": "We report here new copper(I)-Schiff base complexes for the selective oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes under ambient conditions (with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperdine-N-oxyl (TEMPO), N-methylimidazole (NMI), ambient air, acetonitril and RT). Particularly, the copper(I) complex bearing N-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(furan-2-yl)methanimine (L2) showed high activity in the series and gave near- quantitative yields in the oxidations of benzyl alcohol (99% yield in 1\u2009h) and 1-octanol (96% yield in 24\u2009h). Based on the X-ray structure determination, the complex has a square pyramidal coordination accomplished by two L2 ligands and bromide as a counter anion. The oxidation reactions were monitored with UV\u2013vis and in situ ATR-IR spectroscopy to study the changes in the catalytic structure and to elucidate the catalytic properties and the mechanistic details. Accordingly, detachment of one of the L2 ligands from the complexes is related to the oxidation activity.", "Improving patient transportation in hospitals using a mixed-integer programming model ": "This paper investigates the current patient transportation between care units in a large hospital to determine possible solutions to reduce total completion times of demands. The goal is to avoid major changes in the current staff schedules. Historical data of the service calls is available and an in-depth analysis is conducted to identify popular routes and current assignment of demands to patient transport employees. We present a mixed-integer model to determine the best distribution of the employees throughout the most popular routes of the hospital to minimize costs. Experiments are conducted on real data from CHU de Qu\u00e9bec-Universit\u00e9 Laval, HEJ, in the province of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Results obtained from assigning specific employees to routes instead of the current method, which consists at assigning employees to all of the hospital are compared and show that there is a gain in doing so.", "Introducing article numbering to Operations Research for Health Care ": "", "Optimal integration of desensitization protocols into kidney paired donation (KPD) programs ": "Blood type (ABO) incompatibility and antibody to donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) remain the most significant barriers in transplantation. While pre-transplant desensitization can be administered to overcome such incompatibilities between living donors and their kidney recipients, desensitization alone is likely to fail for those pairs with significant incompatibilities. For these pairs, desensitization can be administered in combination with Kidney Paired Donor (KPD) exchange, the system that allows incompatible pairs to exchange donors with other incompatible pairs to improve donor\u2013recipient compatibilities. Prior operations research literature on KPD investigates the optimal strategy to match donors to patients within a given set of incompatible pairs. However, models and algorithms in these studies exclusively look for the best possible match without considering the possibility of combining KPD and desensitization therapy. The current study adapted the existing models to incorporate desensitization as a way to increase KPD efficiency and embedded it into a simulation framework to evaluate the impact of optimally integrating a desensitization protocol in a KPD program. This is the first attempt to quantify the benefit of such an integration. Our results indicated that desensitization as part of a KPD exchange program is a promising approach to improve access to and to reduce wait time for a living donor renal transplant.", "Targeted multi-criteria optimisation in IMRT planning supplemented by knowledge based model creation ": "Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning is an inherently multi-criteria task. A multi-criteria workflow (MCW) typically passes the following steps: create an optimisation model with multiple criteria, approximate the Pareto frontier, and visualise the generated plans to the decision-maker (DM) for inspection. This interactive plan selection and manipulation allow to create better treatment plans as judged by physicians. However, once an optimisation model is specified, optimisation objectives cannot be modified any more. Thus this fixed model implies that a planner has to guess an appropriate model to begin with. Only after Pareto frontier approximation is calculated, the planner can assess the goodness of the model by exploring the trade-offs. The shortcoming of a MCW becomes apparent when the proposed model fails to generate expected trade-offs and the planner is thus forced to refine the model and repeat the calculations. To circumvent this drawback in the MCW, we propose a local multi-criteria workflow (L-MCW) designed and implemented in a collaboration between Fraunhofer ITWM and Varian Medical Systems. L-MCW enables local exploration around an initial, promising plan. The initial plan is automatically inferred by a knowledge-based algorithm (RapidPlan\u2122). The decision-maker can thus evaluate trade-offs in the most interesting region surrounding the initial plan. Clinical results of the combination of knowledge-based planning and L-MCW with a cohort of Prostate and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) Lung cases demonstrate substantially reduced planning time and improved organ-at-risk sparing compared to manual planning. The L-MCW provides an intuitive and flexible mechanism to adapt knowledge-based-planning models to similar, but not identical clinical situations and allows the practitioner to quickly determine and realise the most beneficial trade-offs in a treatment plan.", "A case study of nonlinear programming approach for repeated testing of HIV in a population stratified by subpopulations according to different risks of new infections ": "Motivated by the vision of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS that 90% of people living with HIV will be diagnosed by year 2020, we present an optimization framework regarding repeated testing of an infectious disease which is transmitted unevenly in the population. A subset of HIV surveillance data in Canada with detailed and compatible variables is pooled for statistical analysis. The study population is Men having Sex with Men (MSM) in Canada from the pooled data. Estimated parameters regarding the HIV epidemic in the study population show that, across age strata, the number of new infections is distributed differently from the number of people living with HIV. A nonlinear programming algorithm is developed regarding which strata should be considered for repeated testing. Among strata in which repeated testing is considered, the optimal frequency of testing is calculated by stratum to minimize the expected number of tests per year. Scenarios and options that all fulfil the UNAIDS vision are presented. In addition to minimizing the expected number of tests per year, other considerations are also examined such as annual testing in selected strata and the tolerance to imperfect implementation of the testing program with low coverage or uptake rates.", "Optimal control of intervention strategies and cost effectiveness analysis for a Zika virus model ": "This paper presents an optimal control strategy and a cost effectiveness analysis for the Zika virus disease. A mathematical model for the transmission of the Zika virus is considered with four preventive measures as control, namely: the use of treated bednets, the use of condoms, a medical treatment of infected persons, and the use of indoor residual spray (IRS).

Based on the computational results, we conclude that a strategy that consists of treated bednets, treatment of symptomatic infected humans and indoor residual spray is the most cost effective strategy.", "Treat-to-Target Approach in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: The Role of Advanced Practice Providers ": "Updated therapeutic guidelines for inflammatory bowel disease call for effective disease assessment, early intervention, and personalized patient care using a treat-to-target (T2T) approach. The ongoing, intensive monitoring of a T2T strategy is best facilitated by a multidisciplinary team, but the increased demand on health care systems impedes implementation. Therefore, advanced practice providers have a growing role in bridging the gap between T2T recommendations and clinical practice. Advanced practice providers can effectively facilitate patient-care team communication, deliver patient education, perform in-clinic and remote monitoring of symptoms and treatment response, and assist patients with self-management.", "Nurse Practitioner Transition to Practice: Development of a Residency Program ": "Nurse practitioner residency programs assist new graduates to transition to practice. This article describes the development of a primary care nurse practitioner residency program at a large academic medical center in the mid-Atlantic region. Organizational factors related to program development and support as well as fiscal and human resource considerations are presented. Curricular considerations inclusive of both clinical and didactic content are presented in conjunction with a curricular outline. Finally, recommendations for nurse practitioner residency program development and expansion within academic and nonacademic medical centers are provided.", "Breast Cancer Risk Assessment: Calculating Lifetime Risk Using the Tyrer-Cuzick Model ": "One size does not fit all for breast cancer screening. Early detection and prevention are most effective for those most at risk. Several United States organizations recommend offering annual screening breast magnetic resonance imaging in addition to mammography for women with > 20% lifetime risk for breast cancer using models that take extensive family history into account. The purpose of this article is to help nurse practitioners make critical decisions about breast cancer screening and referrals to genetic services for women based on their lifetime risk for breast cancer. This article reviews several software-based risk assessment models and provides instructions for using the Tyrer-Cuzick model.", "Produced water characteristics, treatment and reuse: A review ": "In oil and gas industry, produced water is considered as the largest waste stream, which contains relatively higher concentration of hydrocarbons, heavy metals and other pollutants. Due to the increase in industrial activities, the generation of produced water has increased all over the world and its treatment for reuse is now important from environmental perspective. Treatment of produced water can be done through various methods including physical (membrane filtration, adsorption etc.), chemical (precipitation, oxidation), and biological (activated sludge, biological aerated filters and others) methods. This paper aims to highlight characteristics of produced water in detail and physical, chemical, and biological techniques used for its treatment. In addition, reuse of produced water for different purposes has been discussed. At the end, few case studies from different countries, related to the treatment and reuse of their produced waters have been included.", "Fouling and cleaning of ultrafiltration membranes: A review ": "Ultrafiltration (UF) is one of the best options for both one-stage and as part of multi-stage water and wastewater purification. This review summarises the known facts about the fouling processes and cleaning procedures and details of the most successful physical and chemical cleaning combinations. The optimum cleaning is closely linked to the nature of the fouling. Precise knowledge of both the fouling type (organic, inorganic, or biological) and the fouling mechanism (gel formation, adsorption, deposition, pore blockage, or cake formation) is the key to success in UF membrane cleaning.", "A new cost effective, long life and low resistance filter cartridge for water treatment ": "Filtration processes constitute the major solution among water treatments, which appear always necessary nowadays to make water suitable for human consumption or domestic uses, due to the gradual deterioration of its quality as a consequence of environmental pollution and industrial processes. In this paper a new type of filtering cartridge is presented, aimed at overcoming the main inconveniences shown by usual commercial cartridges. These drawbacks have been highlighted in a previous experimental work conducted in the Laboratory of Environmental and Maritime Hydraulics (LIDAM) of University of Salerno and aimed at evaluating the head losses produced by the most common filtration cartridges, especially under progressive clog conditions. Head losses, in fact, are particularly undesirable for low-pressure plants, where they can inhibit the normal operation of the installed apparatus. The analysis of the experimental results permitted to reveal several features of the filtration process in commercial cartridges and draw up different remarks, which led, after further laboratory tests here presented, to the design of a new economic, non-toxic, low-resistance and long life-cycle filtration cartridge, proposed and described in this paper. This cartridge, is basically made of a central element in inert cotton wrapped in a cylindrical polypropylene support, similar to the commercial one but with the core protected by elements, such as white marble pebbles, effective microorganism ceramic cylinders and granular active coal, which, while ensuring a good hydraulic permeability, is capable of stopping much of the particles suspended in the fluid before they reach the cartridge causing its clogging. The new design permits, therefore, to significantly reduce, compared with the commercial cartridges, average head losses even for high clogging degrees, and to increase, as a consequence, the life cycle of the cartridges.", "Microalgae cultivation for municipal and piggery wastewater treatment in Brazil ": "Microalgae are a source of high-valuable products covering a wide range of applications. However, costs incurred by cultivating them make it an expensive process. The combination of wastewater treatment and microalgae cultivation is a viable option to reduce expenses related to cultivation. However, municipal wastewater from the centralized Brazilian sanitation system is highly diluted, and it is technically and economically impractical to use it for microalgae cultivation. As an alternative, diluted effluent can be mixed with a different kind of wastewater, aiming to increase the nutrient concentration (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) for microalgae cultivation. In this study, microalgae cultivation and wastewater mixture (municipal and piggery wastewater) treatment were monitored for four weeks. The pilot treatment system consisted of UASB as pre-treatment and Chlorella sorokiniana cultivation in three flat panel photobioreactors. High UASB efficiency was obtained in organic matter removal (> 90%), even with a large variability of initial mixture characteristics. C. sorokiniana production reached about 1\u2009g\u2009L\u22121, with an average removal of dissolved inorganic carbon, orthophosphate and ammonia around 46 to 56%, 40 to 60% and 100%, respectively. Possible solutions to improve the microalgae growth and the system treatment are discussed.", "Wastewater reclamation and reuse trends in Turkey: Opportunities and challenges ": "Climate change, rapid urbanization, industrialization, tourism with a huge amount of wastewater discharge means that wastewater reuse has a great potential in Turkey and reclamation and reuse is the promising candidate to conserve the valuable fresh water sources. The water reuse applications are becoming increasingly a matter of interest in Turkey however it is strongly dependent on following factors: rapid adaptation of urban wastewater reuse programs, the establishment of integrated water resources management framework and guidelines for wastewater reuse programs but on the contrary slow pace of projects, unclear or absence of water quality requirements, the limited commercial development of reclaimed water and lack of public awareness, lack of knowledge about the consequences of untreated or partially treated wastewater discharge into water bodies, difficulties in accepted planning procedures and emerging new technologies in real time scale are the main hurdles in the way of water reclamation and reuse. This paper aims to give an overview of water reuse activities in Turkey and the opportunities and challenges in expanding reclaimed water reuse. This review precisely presents the research trends performed in different institutes to meet the wastewater reuse goal along with the wastewater treatment plants currently working in Turkey.", "A review on nanotechnological application of magnetic iron oxides for heavy metal removal ": "With increasing trend in industrialization, heavy metals possess a great threat to the environment due to their discharge in water and wastewater above permissible limits. Heavy metals have toxic effects on human and environment. However, advancement in newly budding and fangled nanotechnology offers better treatment techniques. Development of novel and cost-effective 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D nanomaterials for environmental remediation, pollution detection and other applications has attracted considerable attention. Zero valent iron and iron oxide nanoparticles are found to be the best candidates for heavy metal adsorption and removal. Various mechanical, optical and electrical properties of nanoparticles play important role in nanoparticle formation and interaction. Forms of iron oxide such as hematite (\u03b1 Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles of varied morphology and size (10\u2009nm, 20\u2009nm, 50\u2009nm etc.) were synthesized by various methods like sol-gel, precipitation, hydrothermal processes and magnetic nano-composites with different iron precursors (iron acetate, iron nitrate, ferric chloride, ferrous sulphate etc.). Iron oxide nanoparticles (in a variety of chemical and structural forms) have already exhibited its diversity and potential in many frontiers of environmental area. Present review is focused on the application of iron and iron oxide nanoparticles towards heavy metal removal.", "Water quality remediation using aquaponics sub-systems as biological and mechanical filters in aquaculture ": "This paper presents data obtained through trials on small-scale aquaponics sub-system which performs the roles of biological and mechanical filters for aquaculture water quality remediation. Aquaponics is a bio-integrated food production system, consisting of closed recirculating aquaculture combined with hydroponics. The trials were conducted on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and the Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa chinensis) over a period of 70\u202fdays. The results revealed that the system is more efficient in terms of plant growth and does not adversely affect the growth of captive stock of fish. Mean (\u00b1\u202fS.D.) values of water temperature, DO, pH, NH3-N, NO2-N, NO3-N and PO4-P during the trial were 25.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25\u202f\u00b0C, 6.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13\u202fmg/L, 7.14\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.06, 0.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02\u202fmg/L, 0.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.22\u202fmg/L, 0.89\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.37\u202fmg/L and 0.45\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202fmg/L, respectively. The average total weight gain by O. niloticus was 637.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.49\u202fg, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 1.47\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.01 which indicated the efficiency of Nile tilapia in converting feed mass \u2013 a universally standard measure of efficiency of feed assimilation into weight gain, especially when there is no additional source of nourishment. High survival rate (95\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8%) was noticed during the trials. The average (\u00b1SD) values of biomass gain by P. vulgaris and B. rapa were 951.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6\u202fg and 85.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.4\u202fg, respectively. The system was cost-effective and efficient in purging the toxic waste from water, resulting in remediation of water quality for the recirculating aquaculture system. This reflected the effectiveness of biofiltration which is currently assessed by its ability to completely remove the ammonia and minimize the generation of nitrite.", "Membrane bioreactor and integrated membrane bioreactor systems for micropollutant removal from wastewater: A review ": "Over the last few decades, the presence of micropollutants in the wastewater stream is imposing a serious concern worldwide. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology has been widely employed for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with micropollutants. Hence, the aim of this paper is to provide a consolidate review on the present state of research and advancement in MBR technology along with its augmentation with other wastewater treatment technologies for micropollutant removal, sustainability, and operating cost assessment for its feasibility. The potential application of MBR and hybrid-MBR systems in micropollutant removal along with the fate, removal mechanism, various factors affecting the MBR system efficiency and the operational cost involved were also been discussed in detail. Further, based on the available technologies on MBR, the authors discussed the future research perspective for micropollutant removal from the effluent stream with an objective of the circular economy.", "3D printing and surface imprinting technologies for water treatment: A review ": "In recent times, 3D printing as a technology has drawn tremendous attention. Also, surface imprinting techniques in general are still evolving especially in the area of membrane design and fabrication. This paper focuses on the different 3D printing techniques in relation to the recent advances and its applications for the fabrication of module spacers and membranes for water treatment. The recent developments in surface imprinting in the area of water treatment and membrane design are also discussed in this paper. Looking at the recent developments in 3D printing technology for water treatment, revolutionary fabrication of novel membrane module components is likely to happen soon. Enhancement of 3D printing technologies in areas of materials, resolution, and speed is expected to increase the applicability of 3D printing technologies in the production of different membrane module components with high efficiency. In the near future, surface imprinting patterns of complex topography can improve performance of 3D printed membranes with applications in water purification and membrane separation.", "Phosphorus reduction in filters for on-site wastewater treatment ": "Discharges of phosphorus (P) from on-site wastewater treatment systems generally contribute to eutrophication problems in Swedish freshwaters and, ultimately, in the Baltic Sea. Such concerns have led to a growing interest in improving P removal in treatment facilities. This study investigated the reduction of P in 12 full-scale on-site treatment systems featuring sand filters and alkaline P-filters by sampling and analysing filter influents and effluents. The flow-proportional samples collected were analysed for total and dissolved P, BOD7, total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC), and pH. Seven of the eight investigated sand filters did not provide satisfactory total P reduction; the likely explanations are filter clogging and wastewater dilution by extraneous water. In addition, effluents from four of the eight sand filters had total P concentrations higher than 3\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121, which is the Swedish effluent limit recommended for common receiving waters, indicating that a subsequent polishing step would be needed. Six of the nine investigated P-filters reduced P adequately, with total P concentrations in the effluent ranging between 0.1 and 1.9\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121. The three underperforming P-filters had effluent pH values below 9; filter age, clogging, and hydraulic overload were identified as probable reasons for their poor performance. A statistically significant correlation was found between total-P reduction and filtrate pH, but no significant correlation was detected between organic load in the influent and P reduction by the P-filters. The P-filter media replacement frequency could not be established, but filtrate pH appeared to be a good estimator.", "Water treatment chemicals: Trends and challenges ": "The addition of water treatment chemicals has always been considered as a standard operation in water and wastewater treatment. The concentration of chemicals was usually kept to the minimum necessary to achieve a good quality of potable or otherwise treated water. A significant interruption to the status-quo occurred more than 20 years ago after a severe and highly publicized outbreak of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. The strategic planning after the outbreak was to shift from physical-chemical to physical treatment methods, such as membrane filtration and UV disinfection. As such, the new procedures were supposed to eliminate the threat of water contamination through a minor addition of chemicals. Such was the mistrust and disappointment with water treatment chemicals themselves.\n                  Indeed, water treatment technologies are now using novel physical treatment methods. Membranes largely replaced granular filtration, and UV is paving the way towards minimization or elimination of the use of classic disinfection chemicals, such as chlorine and its derivatives. Yet, far from the \u201chigh-tech\u201d revolution in water treatment technologies actually reducing the use of chemicals, the latter has in fact been significantly increased. The \u201cconventional\u201d chemicals used for pre-treatment, disinfection, corrosion prevention, softening and algae bloom depression are all still in place. Furthermore, new groups of chemicals such as biocides, chelating agents and fouling cleaners are currently used to supplement them. These latter are the chemicals needed to protect the high-tech equipment, to optimize the treatment, and to clean the equipment between uses.\n                  The health effects of the new chemicals introduced into water are yet to be fully established. Typically, a higher treatment efficiency requires effective chemicals, yet these are not always environmentally friendly. It seems obvious that the \u201chigh-tech\u201d revolution currently affects the sustainability of water resources, and certainly not in a completely positive way. In short, the adverse effects of the introduction of such a significant amount of treatment chemicals into our sources of water are yet to be evaluated.", "Nanofiltration membranes and processes: A review of research trends over the past decade ": "Nanofiltration technology has come a long way since first inception in the late 1980s. Research activity in this area covers a great many topics and the aim of this review is to quantify the level interest in each of these areas. The number of annual publications directly related to nanofiltration technology has been harvested from ScienceDirect since 2007. This quantification of research has shown that interest in nanofiltration technology has grown over the past decade, particularly over the past five years. The primary journals reporting articles on nanofiltration are the Journal of Membrane Science, Desalination and Separation and Purification Technology, although articles have been spread across a further 139 journals. Unsurprisingly, the major topics of interest have been water processing, membrane fabrication and membrane surface modification. There has been clear growth in the areas of organic solvent nanofiltration, pharmaceutical and biological applications, design and economics of nanofiltration processes and review articles. Nanofiltration modelling has received less support over the period reviewed and has experienced a steady decline.\n                  Clearly the overall growing trend in nanofiltration research indicates that the technology remains popular and this interest should materialise into further applications for a robust and sustainable future.", "Revisiting of coagulation-flocculation processes in the production of potable water ": "Water Treatment Plants treat \"flushy\" raw waters and the majority use electrolytes and polyelectrolytes for the removal of the solid and organic impurities included in surface waters. The dose of the used reagents depend strongly on the nature of the incoming surface water and its turbidity. Turbidity is due to the suspended particles in the source water and up to date is main criterion for the appropriate choice of the electrolyte and polyelectrolyte nature and dosage. One of the main findings of the present work is that the selection of the appropriate dose of coagulants and flocculants as a linear function of turbidity is not right, especially for the large values of turbidity. The most common electrolytes Aluminum sulfate and PolyAluminiumChloride together with the polyelectrolyte PolyAcrylaMide, are tested for their effectiveness in the removal of suspended particles and their results discussed based on the particle\u2019s \u03b6-potential and size distribution. These common reagents have raised public health concerns due to the residual aluminium and acrylamide which remain in treated water and at produced sludge. Thus, the present work examined and suggests the use of polymers as the natural Chitosan and CMInulin and the synthetic PolyDiallylDiMethylAmmoniumChloride, as alternative, environmentally friendly coagulants, for their performance on the treatment of potable water. The new reagents proved to reduce the turbidity of the surface water up to 96%.", "Forward osmosis research trends in desalination and wastewater treatment: A review of research trends over the past decade ": "Issues of water scarcity and water security have driven the rapid development of various technologies to ensure water sustainability. The forward osmosis (FO) membrane process has been widely recognized as one of the more promising technologies to play an important role in alleviating the issues of water sustainability. Extensive research has been carried out worldwide to explore the potential of FO in desalination, water and wastewater treatment and reclamation. It is of the utmost importance to understand the topics of interest and research trends to further advance the development of FO process technology. In this study, a bibliometric analysis based on the Scopus database was carried out to identify and understand the global research trends of FO process based on 6 main analyses: basic growth trends, journals, countries, institutions, authors, and keywords. A total of 1462 article records published between 1967\u20132018 were extracted from Scopus and used as the raw data for bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software. The total number of FO articles has sharply increased since 2009 and stabilized at around 250 publications in the past three years. The increase could be associated with the breakthrough in FO membrane science, where the contributions were from the 5 most productive countries: USA, China, Singapore, Australia, and South Korea. FO research started to diversify after the appearance of commercial FO membranes with improved characteristics, enabling the researchers to employ them for various application studies. Keywords analysis showed that the main directions of FO research could be categorized into three clusters: application of FO, membrane fouling study, and FO membrane synthesis. These bibliometric results provide a valuable reference and information on current research directions of FO for researchers and industry practitioners who are interested in FO technology.", "Challenges and trends in membrane technology implementation for produced water treatment: A review ": "This review provides insight into the implementation of membrane technology in the petroleum industry for treating produced water that is generated from conventional oilfields in upstream and downstream processes. The ever-evolving and increasingly stringent regulatory standards for discharging produced water pose colossal environmental and economic implications because the bulk of this produced water is disposed into the environment. Thus, a review of the implementation of membrane technology for produced water treatment could contribute to the knowledge required for the increased introduction of scaled-up membrane technology in the petroleum industry. This review encompasses the capabilities and performance optimization possibilities of microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis membranes. The level of applications that these membrane technologies might attain within the petroleum industry were determined, and these implementations were correlated with the purpose, performance efficiency, treatment system configurations, necessary pretreatment procedures, quality of treated produced water, fouling occurrence and control, foulants, cleaning procedures, raw produced water content, potential challenges with corresponding applied solutions, and economic factors. This review also maps current and future trends and provides a perspective on the outlook for advances in novel membrane applications for produced water treatment.", "Strategies for Nitrate removal from aqueous environment using Nanotechnology: A Review ": "Nitrate is a water pollutant whose removal from water is necessary to lessen pollution and prevent damage to life. Several conventional techniques such as adsorption, ion exchange process, reverse osmosis, electrochemical, chemical, and biological methods have been developed for removal of nitrate, however they have several limitations such as requirement of post-treatment, less efficiency, and high installation costs. The field of Nanotechnology has observed tremendous growth in the past and has many environmental applications such as the use of nanomaterials for soil and water remediation, filtration of pollutants, water purification, biosensors, and in desalination. Recently, Nanotechnology has emerged as an excellent alternative for nitrate removal over conventional techniques. Nanomaterials due to their small size have large surface area and thus have high reactivity which, enables them to be used as reducing agents and adsorbents. This review focuses on the use of different nanomaterials especially nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanofibers, nanoshells, nanoclusters, and nanocomposites for removal of nitrate from an aqueous system. The limitations of using such nanomaterials for removal of nitrate and possible techniques to overcome these limitations have been discussed as well.", "Hybrid anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment for real textile wastewater ": "In this study, working of hybrid anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment technology for real textile wastewater was investigated on the basis of system evaluation and optimization in two phases. In Phase I, system was optimized at laboratory scale on synthetic textile wastewater and later real textile wastewater was treated in Phase II. The study was conducted for 242 days in which industrial discharge coming from textile mill was collected and subjected to laboratory scale hybrid treatment. Activated sludge used in the process was obtained from full scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) plant and adapted to the synthetic and real textile wastewater using anaerobic process. Individual application of anaerobic treatment was found to be insufficient for the removal of COD, TKN and dyes. The proposed combine hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system was found to be effective in reporting removal efficiencies of 99.5% COD, 99.3% TKN, and 78.4% dyes. The anaerobic SBR added value to the hybrid system as it played a key role in improving treatment efficiency in addition to the production of sustainable energy source of biogas. Study shows that aerobic treatment is required to increase the treatment level by providing the final polishing to anaerobically treated effluent in order to reclaim water. The optimum HRT for hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system in treating real textile wastewater was found to be 54\u2009h for maximum COD removal. The implication of this work is the industrial application of hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system for reuse of water in agricultural and industrial sectors.", "Ammonia inhibition and toxicity in anaerobic digestion: A critical review ": "As a waste management technology which offers environmental benefit and renewable energy production, anaerobic digestion (AD) has become the preferred technology for the treatment of organic waste. However, in such waste streams nitrogen contents are likely to be high. There is prevailing literature evidence suggests that high ammonia concentration especially its free molecular form (NH3), derived from nitrogen content in substrates is the cause of inhibition and sudden failure of the AD process.\n                  This paper comprehensively reviews previous knowledge from digestion studies using high nitrogen waste streams as feedstocks and critically analysed the considerable variations in the inhibition/toxicity levels reported for ammonia. Literature evidences suggest methanogens, particularly acetoclastic methanogens are most susceptible to ammonia toxicity, and therefore this review has a particular focus on the mechanism of the \u2018selective\u2019 inhibition to methanogens and the impact of ammonia toxicity to the overall methanogen population in an AD digester. This population change explains in many reported cases that sufficient acclimatisation can significantly alleviate the phenomenon of inhibition and specific requirement of certain trace nutrients. Currently available mitigation strategies for high nitrogen content feedstock digestion are reviewed and discussed in relation to the population change and trace nutrient requirements.", "Degradation of Ibuprofen by UV-LED/catalytic advanced oxidation process ": "Ibuprofen (IBP), a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, has been detected in many rivers and lake waters. This study was aimed to degrade the ibuprofen from synthetic wastewater by using UV-LED/catalytic and UV-LED/oxidants advanced oxidation process. The degradation of IBP was investigated with ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) irradiation in presence of Titanium dioxide (TiO2), Zinc oxide (ZnO), Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Potassium peroxomonosulfte (PMS) and Potassium peroxodisulfate (PDS). It was observed that the degradation of IBP was directly influenced by the pH of IBP solution, and higher degradation rate was observed at lower pH values. The study on effect of irradiation time showed that both TiO2 and ZnO can completely degrade the IBP within 90\u2009min, while H2O2, PMS, and PDS degraded 38%, 55%, and 74% IBP respectively. The UV-LED/TiO2 system was found to be the most efficient among all selected systems (UV-LED/ZnO; UV-LED/H2O2; UV-LED/PMS; UV-LED/PDS). The SPME (Solid phase microextraction)/GC\u2013MS was used for the better illustration of Ibuprofen degradation mechanism and to identify generated byproduct in the degradation process. Four byproducts(benzene 1-ethenyl-4-(2-methypropyl), benzene 1-(1-hydroxyethyl)-4-isobutyl, 4\u2032-(2-methylpropyl)acetophenone, ibuprofen methyl ester) were detected after UV-LED catalytic degradation of IBP solution. The present study showed that the UV-LED/catalyst process significantly enhanced the degradation of IBP in comparison to direct photolysis by UV-LED.", "Treatment of textile industry wastewater by electrocoagulation coupled with electrochemical advanced oxidation process ": "The present study deals with the treatment of real effluents, containing a mixture of reactive dyes (mainly methylene blue), by electrocoagulation (EC) coupled with electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) such as peroxi-coagulation (PC), anodic oxidation (AO), and electro-Fenton (EF), individually. To choose the right treatment process, the key criteria should be higher degradation efficiency and minimal energy consumption. Textile effluents are physico-chemical characterized and the operating parameters i.e. the initial pH, the current density, and the electrolysis time, were investigated. Wastewater treatment energy consumption was evaluated for each combined process. The results highlighted high efficiency of electrochemical processes in effective degradation of organic pollutants at the optimum operating conditions. Among the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes tested, sequential EC-EF treatment was being preferred and quite effective since it provided electro generated hydroxyl radical \n                        \n                     OH especially when using the boron-doped diamond. Thus, removals of 97%, 100% and 100% for, respectively, TOC, turbidity and color removal were achieved by using the EC-EF combined process. Energy consumption values were evaluated for textile dye decolorization as 0.45\u20131.5\u202fkW\u202fh\u202fkg\u22121 of the removed TOC, depending on the applied current density. Regarding the efficiency level and the operating cost, the EC-EF combined process offers many advantages allowing the reuse of the treated water for other purposes.", "Investigation of membrane fouling in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating pharmaceutical wastewater ": "This study is focused on the fouling of flat-sheet and hollow-fiber membranes in a lab-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). A comprehensive investigation including scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), zeta potential, optical profilometer and contact angle, and flux modelling was presented in this study. The effect of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) accumulated on cake-layer were also considered. The cake-layer on the flat-sheet membrane formed much more than that on the hollow-fiber membrane. The thickness of cake-layer on the flat-sheet membrane was effectively decreased by physical stripping. However, proteins indicating structures of Amide I and Amide II, and carbohydrates were observed on the stripped hollow-fiber membrane. According to the flux modelling results, the cake-layer formation and intermediate-adsorption were found as effective mechanisms on both membranes. Especially, these mechanisms were more effective for the hollow-fiber membrane due to irreversible fouling.", "Removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater using reverse osmosis for its subsequent reuse: Pilot plant ": "The presence in natural watercourses of different types of emerging contaminants (including stimulants and antibiotics) from different sources constitutes a serious environmental issue. The problem is aggravated in regions where water is scarce and its reuse should form part of its integrated cycle. The removal of these contaminants, so that the water may be reused, is currently one of the most widely studied issues in the field of wastewater treatment. Within this context, the present paper addresses the removal of different contaminants (caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, amoxicillin, and penicillin G). The chosen treatment was the use of reverse osmosis membranes, which were installed at the outlet of the secondary settling tank of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Medina Sidonia (SW Spain), carrying out sampling in the feed, reject and permeate streams over a period of 72\u2009h. DOW-FILMTEC BW30-2540 membranes were used for this purpose, operating at a pressure of 15\u2009bar. The emerging contaminants were analysed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The applied treatments allowed a contaminant-free permeate to be obtained with the required quality for its reuse. This technique achieved 100% removal of the contaminants without signs of membrane deterioration after running the 72\u2009h test.", "Development and efficacy analysis of a Moringa oleifera based potable water purification kit ": "The purpose of this study was to develop a water purification kit using seeds of Moringa oleifera (MO). For this purpose, aqueous extract of MO seeds was investigated for antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacterial strains viz. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). It was determined that 100\u2009mg/mL of extract of MO seeds was effective against these bacterial strains resulting in 28.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.707\u2009mm of inhibition zone against E. coli, 26.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.707\u2009mm against S. aureus, 26.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u2009mm against S. typhi, 29.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.707\u2009mm against P. aeruginosa and 25.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.707\u2009mm against MRSA. MIC (Minimum inhibitory concentration) of 12.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u2009mg/mL against E. coli and 6.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u2009mg/mL against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. typhi, and MRSA was obtained. Accordingly, portable water purification kit in the form of a dip bag enclosing extremely safe and edible MO seed powder was developed as a key to drinking water problem. Water purification was performed using dip bag to treat pathogenic strains inoculated in water. The minimum time and seed quantity required for the anti-bacterial activity of seeds was optimized and was noted that a single dip bag containing 100\u2009mg of MO seed powder was capable of eradicating 99.9% of the microbial load from 1\u2009L of water in a time span of 5\u2009min. Drinking water from natural water resources containing coliform bacteria was also tested using dip bag and was found to be equally effective.", "Combined energy and removal efficiency of electrochemical wastewater treatment for leather industry ": "Wastewater treatment and low energy consumption are two important environmental issues. In this work, a challenging treatment problem of leather industry wastewater is chosen as a case study to combine the issue of energy and treatment efficiency using a common denominator of oxygen demand. Tannery wastewater is known for its highly contaminated structure. Due to the acidic nature of the effluent, conventional methods do not perform well for tannery wastes, so an electrochemical process is a reasonable approach for the problem. Since electrochemical reactors use electricity, the energy efficiency of such plants should be simultaneously considered for overall sustainability. The electricity production partially results in carbon footprints and consumption of oxygen. In this work, the electrochemical treatment results were assessed through total chromium removal and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction. As expected, the electrochemical process parameters (reactor types, electrode variations, electrical current density, etc.) as well as the process duration affect the treatment performance. Meanwhile, these parameters also affect energy consumption. Although the energy consumption has been previously researched, (i) \u201cthe oxygen equivalent of the required energy\u201d and (ii) \u201coxygen demand reduction of the wastewater\u201d were not considered simultaneously before. In this work, the used energy is represented in terms of consumed oxygen at the current electric generation profile (in Turkey and in USA). It is argued that, as the consumed energy increases, the consumed oxygen also increases, causing a separate pollution (in terms of COD and other indirect effects). The combined production/consumption profiles as well as energy efficient parameter settings are investigated by experiments. It is observed that the combined oxygen demand (i.e. reduced on the treatment side and increased at the power generation side) starts exhibiting an overall increase at early treatment stages. For example, at an electrical current setting of 20\u202fmA/cm2 and pH of 7, using electro-coagulation with aluminum electrodes, treatment reaches to 82% COD removal (from 1024\u202fmg/L to 180.71\u202fmg/L) at 8.33\u202fkWh/m3, corresponding to consuming 3.23\u202fg/L oxygen at average energy production settings in Turkey. The oxygen consumption using electro-Fenton exhibits similar results. The necessity of renewable energy utilization or an earlier treatment termination is concluded.", "Sugarcane vinasse processing: Toward a status shift from waste to valuable resource. A review ": "The foreseeable increase of bioethanol production by distilleries will inevitably lead to an important increase in production of the associated effluent, namely vinasse. Due to its high pollution load, characterized by high chemical oxygen demand, high salt content and heavy dark color, the depollution of this effluent is mandatory before release into nature. In this work, we reviewed the literature on the main physicochemical and biological treatments of sugarcane vinasse and emphasised on the technological valuation of vinasse that allows to shift the status of the effluent from waste to valuable resource. The membrane systems seem to offer the best depollution option but they are subjected to strong technical limitations. Several alternative processes have been proposed, but they generally fail to treat the entire organic load of waste when used in stand-alone technology, while generating higher investment costs in the treatment process. The biological processes turn out to be particularly promising as they are able to produce interesting metabolites from living cells. Among them, production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is by far the most developed and economically viable process for treatment of vinasse. However a few works, also using vinasse as a growth medium, have been published on development of innovative technics to produce single cell products such as lipids, proteins, organic acids, alcohols or enzymes. In the medium term, technologies to produce third generation biodiesel are developing to complement and compete with fuels derived from petroleum. Finally, the development of hydrogen production processes from vinasse is emerging, thus preparing us for a long-term decarbonised economy.", "Sustainable Industry 4.0 framework: A systematic literature review identifying the current trends and future perspectives ": "Industry 4.0 and its other synonyms like Smart Manufacturing, Smart Production or Internet of Things, have been identified as major contributors in the context of digital and automated manufacturing environment. The term industry 4.0 comprises a variety of technologies to enable the development of the value chain resulting in reduced manufacturing lead times, and improved product quality and organizational performance. Industry 4.0 has attracted much attention in the recent literature, however there are very few systematic and extensive review of research that captures the dynamic nature of this topic. The rapidly growing interest from both academics and practitioners in Industry 4.0 has urged the need for review of up-to-date research and development to develop a new agenda. Selected 85 papers were classified in five research categories namely conceptual papers on Industry 4.0, human-machine interactions, machine-equipment interactions, technologies of Industry 4.0 and sustainability. The review primarily attempted to seek answers to the following two questions: (1) What are different research approaches used to study Industry 4.0? and (2) What is the current status of research in the domains of Industry 4.0?. We propose a sustainable Industry 4.0 framework based on the findings of the review with three critical components viz., Industry 4.0 technologies, process integration and sustainable outcomes. Finally, the scope of future research is discussed in detail.", "Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste: A review ": "This paper reviews the progress and challenges of the catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste along with future perspectives in comparison to thermal pyrolysis. The factors affecting the catalytic pyrolysis process such as the temperature, retention time, feedstock composition and the use of catalyst were evaluated in detail to improve the process of catalytic pyrolysis. Pyrolysis can be carried out via thermal or catalytic routes. Thermal pyrolysis produces low quality liquid oil and requires both a high temperature and retention time. In order to overcome these issues, catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste has emerged with the use of a catalyst. It has the potential to convert 70\u201380% of plastic waste into liquid oil that has similar characteristics to conventional diesel fuel; such as the high heating value (HHV) of 38\u201345.86MJ/kg, a density of 0.77\u20130.84g/cm3, a viscosity of 1.74\u20132.5mm2/s, a kinematic viscosity of 1.1\u20132.27 cSt, a pour point of (\u22129) to (\u221267)\u00b0C, a boiling point of 68\u2013352\u00b0C, and a flash point of 26.1\u201348\u00b0C. Thus the liquid oil from catalytic pyrolysis is of higher quality and can be used in several energy-related applications such as electricity generation, transport fuel and heating source. Moreover, process by-products such as char has the potential to be used as an adsorbent material for the removal of heavy metals, pollutants and odor from wastewater and polluted air, while the produced gases have the potential to be used as energy carriers. Despite all the potential advantages of the catalytic pyrolysis, some limitations such as high parasitic energy demand, catalyst costs and less reuse of catalyst are still remaining. The recommended solutions for these challenges include exploration of cheaper catalysts, catalyst regeneration and overall process optimization.", "Electrochemical oxidation remediation of real wastewater effluents \u2014 A review ": "Fate and health risks associated with persistent organic pollutants present in water effluents are one of the major environmental challenges of this century. In this paper, the electrochemical advanced oxidation process electrochemical oxidation is reviewed for its performance over the treatment of actual industrial and urban effluents. The electrochemical treatment of industrial effluents resulting from textile dyeing, petrochemical, paper mill, tannery industry as well as the treatment of domestic and urban wastewaters are discussed. Furthermore, the combination of electrochemical oxidation with other water treatment technologies as pre-treatment, post-treatment, and integrated treatment is also examined.", "Evaluating challenges to Industry 4.0 initiatives for supply chain sustainability in emerging economies ": "Industry 4.0 initiatives can influence whole business system via transforming the means the products are designed, produced, delivered and discarded. Industry 4.0 is relatively novel to developing nations, especially in India and needs a clear definition for proper understanding and practice in business. This paper aims to recognize key challenges to Industry 4.0 initiatives and analyze the identified key challenges to prioritize them for effective Industry 4.0 concepts for supply chain sustainability in emerging economies by taking Indian manufacturing industry perspective. Industry 4.0 initiatives can help industries to incorporate environmental protection and control initiatives as well as process safety measures in supply chains towards sustainable supply chains. However, adoption of Industry 4.0 initiatives is not so easy due to existence of many challenges. Therefore, the present research identifies 18 key challenges to Industry 4.0 initiatives for developing supply chain sustainability using an extensive literature review. These challenges were analyzed through 96 responses received from Indian manufacturing sector using a questionnaire based survey. Explanatory Factor Analysis results classified identified challenges into four key dimensions of challenges. Analytical Hierarchy Process further ranks the identified dimensions of challenges and related challenges. Findings of the study revealed that Organizational challenges holds the highest importance followed by Technological challenges, Strategic challenges, and Legal and ethical issues. This work is very useful for practitioners, policy makers, regulatory bodies and managers to develop an in-depth understanding of Industry 4.0 initiatives and eradicate the potential challenges in adopting Industry 4.0 initiatives for supply chain sustainability.", "Investigating the performance of internet of things based anaerobic digestion of food waste ": "A pilot scale decentralised Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) was designed, developed and installed, with 675\u202fL working volume, to treat food waste generated from the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) campus community. The reactor was operated in mesophilic, anaerobic and wet condition with feedstock as food waste of 10% Total Solids (TS) content. This study aims for performance evaluation of food waste anaerobic digestion and development of remote monitoring system suitable for centralised monitoring of decentralised anaerobic digestion plants. The performance of the reactor was remotely monitored with the installation of pH, Temperature and Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) electrodes connected with the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The quality of biogas produced was monitored by online biogas analyzer system. The CSTR was operated with three different Organic Loading Rates (OLR) viz., 1, 2 and 3\u202fkg of volatile solids per cubic meter of digester per day (kg VS/m3.d) to evaluate performance of the food waste digestion and biogas production. The average biogas yield was 0.75, 0.62 and 0.52 cubic meter per kilogram of volatile solids (m3/kg VS), with average methane yield of 0.42, 0.33 and 0.27\u202fm3/kg VS at OLR of 1, 2 and 3\u202fkg VS/m3.d respectively. Furthermore, it was observed that the average reduction in total solids was 70.7, 66.5 and 54.98% and average reduction in volatile solids was 78.3, 72 and 67% at OLR of 1, 2 and 3\u202fkg VS/m3.d respectively. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled remote monitoring on real time basis and aided the centralised operator to improve the process performance resulting in better operation and maintenance of the decentralised anaerobic digestion systems.", "J-value assessment of relocation measures following the nuclear power plant accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi ": "The policies of population relocation put in train following the severe nuclear reactor accidents at Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima Daiichi in 2011 are examined using the Judgement- or J-value. Here relocation is taken to mean a movement of people that is long-term or permanent. A review is made of a 1992 IAEA/CEC study of the Chernobyl countermeasures, which includes data from which the effectiveness of the 1986 and post-1990 relocations may be judged using the J-value. The present analysis provides endorsement of that study\u2019s conclusion that the post-1990 relocation of 220,000 members of the public could not be justified on the grounds of radiological health benefit. Moreover, application of the J-value suggests that the first Chernobyl relocation is economically defensible for between 26% and 62% of the roughly 115,000 people actually moved in 1986. Thus only between 9% and 22% of the 335,000 people finally relocated after Chernobyl were justifiable, based on the J-value and the data available. Nor does the J-value support the relocation of the 160,000 people moved out on a long-term basis after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. The J-value results for these very severe nuclear accidents should inform the decisions of those deciding how best to respond to a big nuclear accident in the future. The overall conclusion is that relocation should be used sparingly if at all after any major nuclear accident. It is recognised that medical professionals are seeking a good way to communicate radiation risks in response to frequent requests from the general public for information and explanation in a post-accident situation. Radiation-induced loss of life expectancy, which lies at the heart of the application of the J-value to nuclear accidents, is proposed as an information-rich yet easy to understand statistic that the medical profession and others may find helpful in this regard.", "Pharma Industry 4.0: Literature review and research opportunities in sustainable pharmaceutical supply chains ": "The exploitation of the emerging technologies of Pharma Industry 4.0 facilitates sustainable value creation, leads to more agile, smart and personalised pharma industry, and thereby, in the long-run, enables pharma companies to obtain competitive advantages. A more sustainable pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) should be implemented to match future operations and management of the pharmaceutical products across the entire life cycle. The main purpose of this study is to identify the potential sustainability barriers of PSC and to investigate how Industry 4.0 can be applied in the sustainable PSC paradigms. This paper systematically reviews 33 relevant articles concerning sustainable PSC and Industry 4.0, taken from peer-reviewed academic journals over a decade (2008\u20132018). Based on content analysis, we find that the major challenges that inhibit inclusion of sustainability in the PSCs are: high costs and time consumption, little expertise and training, enforcement of regulations, the paucity of business incentives, ineffective collaborations and coordination across the PSC, lack of objective benchmarks, and poor end-customer awareness. The technologies and innovations based on Industry 4.0 can solve these barriers with regards to four aspects: enhancing the flexibility of the PSC for patient-centric drug supplies; improving the effectiveness of coordination and communication across different entities within the PSC; mitigating waste and pollution at different stages; and enabling a more autonomous decision-making process for supply chain managers. Our analysis reveals that future research interest should focus on: cross-linking coordination and cooperation, eco-friendly end-of-life products disposal, proactive product recall management, new benchmarks and measurement of sustainable performance, new regulation system design, and effects of incentives for sustainable activities.", "A review on approaches for addressing the limitations of Fenton oxidation for recalcitrant wastewater treatment ": "Fenton oxidation is an effective technology for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants. However, conventional Fenton oxidation possesses some drawbacks such as the requirement of acidic pH condition, production of iron sludge and requirement of high chemical inputs. Strategies such as heterogeneous Fenton, fluidized bed Fenton, use of chelating agents and in-situ production of Fenton\u2019s reagent have been studied as possible solutions to these limitations. Although there have been reviews on the fundamentals and applications of Fenton oxidation, a review with focus on the limitations of Fenton oxidation and their possible solutions is lacking. Here, we review the limitations of Fenton oxidation and the recent strategies toward addressing them. For each approach, fundamentals and applications in the removal of recalcitrant pollutants are reviewed. Heterogeneous Fenton process is the most widely investigated due to the progress in catalysis. Fluidized bed Fenton process could lower sludge generation and enhance process performance. Chelating agents are used to conduct homogeneous Fenton at circumneutral pH, though the potential detrimental effect of some chelating agents remains a source of concern. In situ production of Fenton\u2019s reagent through bioelectrochemical technology (bioelectro-Fenton) is emerging as a possible strategy to reduce the cost associated with Fenton\u2019s reagent.", "Biopotential of compost and compost products derived from horticultural waste\u2014Effect on plant growth and plant pathogens' suppression ": "Besides ecological and environmental benefits of green open spaces, horticultural waste management has various environmental consequences. Green waste composting represents promising environmentally friendly alternative which gives valuable products with positive soil and plants impact. Composting products\u2019 quality determinates their application and depends on the particular waste material and process parameters. The aim of this paper was to estimate the chemical and microbiological quality of green waste compost and compost products (compost tea, compost extract and the solid phase after extraction), and their biopotential based on germination rate, germination index and inhibition of phytopathogenic fungi growth. Higher germination rate of examined plant seeds was noticed on the solid phase after extraction, and compost extract, compared to compost, and compost tea, respectively. Plants with low germination rate grown on compost showed higher fresh and dry biomass. Compost products strongly inhibited the growth of plant pathogens Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia sp., and Pythium debaryanum. Presented results show that composted biodegradable waste from urban green spaces contribute to the plant growth and phytopathogenic fungi suppression, and thus improve the overall environmental quality.", "Promising prospects of nanomaterials for arsenic water remediation: A comprehensive review ": "This review discusses the brief of health problem associated with the arsenic exposure found in drinking water.

Operations of localised facilities independent of global operations can result in compromised global synergies. Centralised functions such as research and development, optimisations of assets, corporate planning (strategy, investment planning, financial), and supply chain together with any other function deliver significant business value. Integration of these functions via industry 4.0 delivers significant business value, delivering strategic and operational benefits. This research proposes a global system approach, as defined by industry 4.0 (vertical, horizontal and total business integration), to this challenge, from ERP through manufacturing systems down to instrumentation.

This proposed architecture is reinforced by a simulation illustrating the benefits of the integrated business.", "Assessing challenges for implementing Industry 4.0: Implications for process safety and environmental protection ": "Researchers and practitioners are giving significant attention to Industry 4.0 due to its numerous benefits to manufacturing organizations. Several aspects of Industry 4.0 have been studied in the literature. However, studies on the challenges for implementing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing operations have received less attention. To address this gap, this study identifies a set of challenges (framework) for implementing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing industries. This framework is evaluated in the leather industry of Bangladesh aided by a novel multi-criteria decision-making method named Best-Worst method (BWM). The findings of the study showed that \u2018lack of technological infrastructure\u2019 is the most pressing challenge that may hurdle the implementation of Industry 4.0 whereas \u2018environmental side-effects\u2019 is the less among the challenges that may hinder implementation of Industry 4.0 in the Bangladeshi leather industry. This result may help decision makers, industrial managers and practitioners in the Bangladeshi leather industry to realize the actual challenges confronting them when attempting to implement Industry 4.0 and focus their attention on how to address these challenges to pave ways for a successful implementation of Industry 4.0.", "A review on application of flocculants in wastewater treatment ": "Flocculation is an essential phenomenon in industrial wastewater treatment. Inorganic coagulants (salts of multivalent metals) are being commonly used due to its low cost and ease of use. However, their application is constrained with low flocculating efficiency and the presence of residue metal concentration in the treated water. Organic polymeric flocculants are widely used nowadays due to its remarkable ability to flocculate efficiently with low dosage. However, its application is associated with lack of biodegradability and dispersion of monomers residue in water that may represent a health hazard. Therefore, biopolymers based flocculants have been attracting wide interest of researchers because they have the advantages of biodegradability and environmental friendly. But, natural flocculants are needed in large dosage due to its moderate flocculating efficiency and shorter shelf life. Thus, in order to combine the best properties of both, synthetic polymers are grafted onto the backbone of natural polymers to obtain tailor-made grafted flocculants. This paper gives an overview of the development of different types of flocculants that were being investigated for treatment of industrial wastewater. Furthermore, their flocculation performance will be reviewed and the flocculation mechanism will be discussed.", "Performance augmentation of flat plate solar water collector using phase change materials and nanocomposite phase change materials: A review ": "Harvesting solar energy through usage of flat plate solar water collector (FPSWCs) has been widely used in different domestic, agricultural, and industrial applications. Phase change materials (PCMs), due to their unique thermo-physical properties, have been exploited in different designs of solar collectors to maximize the useful heat gained by collectors. Moreover, adding nanoparticles to PCMs to produce nanocomposite (NC) PCMs with superior thermo-physical properties added new advantages to the applications of these materials in solar collector applications. This literature review focuses on the different developments of these materials and their implementation with flat plate solar water collectors. Furthermore, the effect of adding different types of nanoparticles, including: metal, metal oxides, carbon nanoparticles, a high thermal conductivity skeleton graphite, and metal foams, on the heat transfer behavior and thermal conductivity of PCMs are also reviewed and analyzed. The reviewed results indicated that a significant improvement in the thermal conductivity of PCMs has been obtained using carbon-based nanoparticles, specifically graphite and graphene nano-platelets compared to metal and metal oxides nanoparticles at different nanoparticle concentrations. It is also revealed that, the integration of the PCMs in FPSWCs leads to a satisfactory storage capacity and could provide hot water temperature for a longer time. Moreover, it is recommended that the use of NCPCMs may be considered as an effective tool to improve the efficiency of the FPSWC. However, further optimization studies are needed to explore the impact of different factors such as nanoparticle type, nanoparticle weight fraction, nanoparticle size, and PCM type on the collector performance. A noteworthy observations, important proportionalities, and future trends are also discussed.", "Spatial characteristics of heavy metal pollution and the potential ecological risk of a typical mining area: A case study in China ": "The goal of the presented research was to evaluate the possible heavy metal pollution in soil by applying Hakanson risk evaluation method with adjusting assessment domain combined with ArcGIS technology. The assessment standards were adjusted based on the amount and types of studied heavy metals. Topsoil samples in mining area were collected and tested the content of five kinds of heavy metals, Arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn). The area of different risk levels and the area ratio in each township were accurately calculate, and the regions with high pollution risk were further precisely located. The results indicate the following: (1) It was observed that the accuracy of soil-heavy metal assessment in Suxian was evidently improved by using Hakanson potential ecological risk with assessment domain adjustment. (2) The single factor and Nemero pollution indexes showed an evident contamination of five types of heavy metals in Suxian. (3) There is a high index of comprehensive ecological risk in Suxian; approximately 82.9% of Suxian is at a strong (level 3 or higher) risk level, demonstrating serious soil pollution. The quite strong risk region with the portion of 18.33% of total area is primarily concentrated in the area of the large Polymetallic mine and coal mining area. Using the single factor ecological risk index, the distribution of large areas of As and Pb high-risk pollution were explored. More than half of the soil in Suxian presents a strong Hg (level 3 and higher) risk level, and the primary strong ecological risk and quite strong ecological risk townships were identified as well. (4) A more finely characterized pollution status was achieved from this pollution assessment in Suxian based on the township level, rendering the study results a more practical guide and increasing their significance.", "Industry 4.0 as enabler for a sustainable development: A qualitative assessment of its ecological and social potential ": "In 2015, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Agenda 2030 which counts 17 indivisible and self-sustaining goals. These so-called Sustainable Development Goals are intended to serve as a foundation for a transformation of the global economies towards a sustainable development. This transformation process should be built on an economic development in accordance with social equality and within ecological boundaries. As essential stakeholders for a global sustainable development, industrial organizations have to shift towards a novel paradigm which puts an emphasis on sustainable value creation. Industrial value creation has gone through radical changes during the last years. Since the 2010s, the so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) can be observed. The state of the art in research and technology for Industry 4.0 and sustainability is outlined. The potential for sustainable value creation in Industry 4.0 is qualitatively assessed for a macro and micro perspective based on a literature review and expert interviews. The assessment unfolds that the value creation might positively contribute to a sustainable development in many cases. Critical areas with expected negative contributions related to the quantity of materials used, primary energy consumption, and working conditions are identified and elaborated in more detail. A demonstrator for an intelligent cube production is investigated in order to verify the results of the assessment. This demonstrator is currently set up in China as part of a Sino-German Research Institute.", "A review of hazards associated with primary lithium and lithium-ion batteries ": "Primary lithium batteries contain hazardous materials such as lithium metal and flammable solvents, which can lead to exothermic activity and runaway reactions above a defined temperature. Lithium-ion batteries operating outside the safe envelope can also lead to formation of lithium metal and thermal runaway. Despite protection by battery safety mechanisms, fires originating from primary lithium and lithium-ion batteries are a relatively frequent occurrence.\n                  This paper reviews the hazards associated with primary lithium and lithium-ion cells, with an emphasis on the role played by chemistry at individual cell level. Safety mechanisms to prevent the occurrence and limit the consequences of incidents are reviewed, together with safety tests to monitor compliance with battery safety regulations and standards. Incident information from news accounts and open literature sources are reviewed to extract causal information.\n                  It is concluded that the potential severity of incidents during storage, transport and recycling of waste batteries can be significantly higher than in end-use applications. Safe storage, packaging and labelling practices, as well as communication among the parties involved, are essential to ensure safety across the battery lifecycle. It is recommended that a database of lithium battery incidents would be valuable to improve the evidence base for informing accident prevention measures.", "Use of membrane technology for oil field and refinery produced water treatment\u2014A review ": "With the advent of modern drilling technology namely sand-tar, hydraulic fracturing and enhanced oil recovery, the amount of waste water to be treated before reuse and/or discharge to the environment has increased manifold in recent time. The treatment of produced water and refinery waste water from the oil industry has been traditionally done by physical as well as chemical processes. The use of membrane technology for the produced and refinery waste water treatment has been recent phenomenon and active research has been focused to enhance the efficiency and life time of the membrane during the operation of the waste water treatment. In this review we briefly focus on the produced and refinery waste water treatment by primary and secondary treatment in historical perspective followed by focusing on various membrane technologies starting from microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO). Finally we also focus on the membrane distillation (MD) in combination with forward osmosis (FO) as potential future technology.", "An intelligent fire detection approach through cameras based on computer vision methods ": "Fire that is one of the most serious accidents in petroleum and chemical factories, may lead to considerable production losses, equipment damages and casualties. Traditional fire detection was done by operators through video cameras in petroleum and chemical facilities. However, it is an unrealistic job for the operator in a large chemical facility to find out the fire in time because there may be hundreds of video cameras installed and the operator may have multiple tasks during his/her shift. With the rapid development of computer vision, intelligent fire detection has received extensive attention from academia and industry. In this paper, we present a novel intelligent fire detection approach through video cameras for preventing fire hazards from going out of control in chemical factories and other high-fire-risk industries. The approach includes three steps: motion detection, fire detection and region classification. At first, moving objects are detected through cameras by a background subtraction method. Then the frame with moving objects is determined by a fire detection model which can output fire regions and their locations. Since false fire regions (some objects similar with fire) may be generated, a region classification model is used to identify whether it is a fire region or not. Once fire appears in any camera, the approach can detect it and output the coordinates of the fire region. Simultaneously, instant messages will be immediately sent to safety supervisors as a fire alarm. The approach can meet the needs of real-time fire detection on the precision and the speed. Its industrial deployment will help detect fire at the very early stage, facilitate the emergency management and therefore significantly contribute to loss prevention.", "Modeling and optimization of heterogeneous Fenton-like and photo-Fenton processes using reusable Fe3O4-MWCNTs ": "In this work, iron (II, III) oxide (Fe3O4) was synthesized and incorporated onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to prepare Fe3O4-MWCNTs composite in a quest for evaluating its performance and reusability in both Fenton-like and photo-Fenton processes. The characterization of Fe3O4-MWCNTs by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy showed that the prepared catalyst can behave as a composite. Methylene blue (MB) was used as a substrate for evaluation of Fenton-like and photo-Fenton processes. The reusability of the catalyst and the influence of operation parameters such as pH, H2O2 dosage, and catalyst loading were investigated. Complete degradation of MB was attained by Fe3O4-MWCNTs in the aforementioned processes, whereas the removal efficiency of MB by using bare MWCNTs under the same conditions was 52%, which suggests that the generated oxidant species due to the reactions between H2O2 and leached iron contribute to the degradation of MB. A degradation pathway was proposed based on the oxidation intermediates that have been detected by mass spectrometry. The reusability of Fe3O4-MWCNTs has been examined in four consecutive cycles. The final removal of MB in the fourth cycle was 94%. The optimization of MB removal was investigated by response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD). Moreover, an artificial neural network (ANN) of type feed-forward back propagation was employed to model the influence of operating conditions. The ANN model revealed a high correlation in the prediction of the removal efficiency (R2\n                     =0.9934).", "Methods and models in process safety and risk management: Past, present and future ": "The paper reviews past progress in the development of methods and models for process safety and risk management and highlights the present research trends; also it outlines the opinions of the authors regarding the future research direction in the field.

The samples exhibited porous structure, low density of 6.99mg/cm3, good thermostability, excellent hydrophobicity with water contact angle of 146\u00b0. The properties of graphene aerogel have been significantly improved by introducing grass powder, leading to highly efficient selective adsorption. The adsorption capacity of GGA ranged from 68.40 to 145.84g/g for various liquid solvents, which is superior to that of unmodified graphene aerogel (GA). Moreover, GGA can be regenerated by repeated heat treatment and its adsorption capacity maintaining at above 90% of initial value after regeneration. GGA can realize oil-water separation of mixed solution by different manipulation methods. On one hand, GGA removed little oils in water through adsorption. On the other hand, GGA can act as filter media dealing with oil-water mixtures and collecting oils continuously by gravity or peristaltic pump. Good selectivity, high adsorption capacities and satisfactory recoverability make it possible to become a potential candidate in the field of oil-water separation and spill oil cleanup to realize environmental remediation. In the meantime, the incorporation of grass improves the performances of graphene aerogel in hydrophobicity, mechanical property and oil adsorption efficiency, providing a new path for high-value utilization of biomass waste.", "A bibliometric review of process safety and risk analysis ": "Process safety and risk analysis have paramount significance in the modern process industries for preventing fatalities and asset and reputation loss due to an accident. Hence, this has been an active area of research for many decades around the world. In this paper, a bibliometric analysis-based review is presented to investigate the evolution of process safety and risk research. Specifically, the following basic questions are addressed: (i) Which countries are active in the research? (ii) What are the key areas? (iii) Who are the leading contributing authors? (iv) What are the potential sources of the publications? (v) What is the focus of most of the documents? (vi) What are the dominant factors behind the citations? and (vii) What is the contribution of the industries?

China, Malaysia, and Iran are the emerging countries with an impressive percentage increase in research volume in this decade (2009\u20132018). The USA is the leading contributor, and India is the most cost-effective country. Methodology development-related works cover the vast portion of this field, and journals focusing on these works are highly likely to be cited by peer researchers. Despite a healthy contribution from industry, unfortunately collaborative works between industry and academia are rare. It is also observed that the field of process safety and risk analysis is of great growth potential with an exponential increase in the number of annual publications.", "Investigation on underwater spreading characteristics and migration law of oil leakage from damaged submarine pipelines ": "Great threats and damages to natural ecosystem and marine environment will be caused once oil and gas leakage occurs. It is crucial to develop a quick response strategy, including the accurate prediction of oil and gas migration path, oil droplet size distribution and other parameters. Volume of fluid (VOF) model and realizable k-\u03b5 turbulence model are employed to investigate the underwater spreading characteristics and migration law of oil leakage. Influencing factors such as wave length, leakage direction, current speed, wind speed, oil density, and leaking rate are analyzed by numerical simulation. The calculation results indicates that wave length affects both the underwater spread and drift process, while current speed and wind speed mainly influence the drift process. Leakage direction, oil density and leaking rate have significant influence on underwater spread process but limited effect on drift process. A formula is proposed to predict the oil diffusion distance at certain time. The results of investigation can offer a valuable guidance for formulation of emergency response.", "Coping after a big nuclear accident ": "", "Powerful combination of MOFs and C3N4 for enhanced photocatalytic performance ": "Both pristine metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) displayed outstanding photocatalytic performances toward H2 production, CO2 reduction, Cr(VI) reduction and organic pollutants degradation. To further enhance their photocatalytic performances under visible light or sunlight irradiation, MOFs and g-C3N4 were combined to construct g-C3N4/MOF heterojunctions with the purpose of overcoming their individual disadvantages like fast recombination of pohotogenerated electron-hole pairs. The fabrication methods, characterizations, photocatalytic performances and the corresponding mechanism of some typical g-C3N4/MOF composites were highlighted. Also, the prospective and challenges of this research field were declared.", "Ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-scheme H2-production photocatalyst ": "The appropriate interfacial contact of heterojunction photocatalysts plays a critical role in transfer/separation of interfacial charge carriers. Design of two-dimensional (2D)/2D surface-to-surface heterojunction is an effective method for improving photocatalytic activity since greater contact area can enhance interfacial charge transfer rate. Herein, ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-like composite heterojunction photocatalysts were fabricated by electrostatic self-assembly of ultrathin tungsten trioxide (WO3) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets. The ultrathin WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets were obtained by electrostatic-assisted ultrasonic exfoliation of bulk WO3 and a two-step thermal-etching of bulk g-C3N4, respectively. The thickness of ultrathin WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets are 2.5\u20133.5\u2009nm, which is equivalent to 5\u20138 atomic or molecular layer thickness. This ultrathin layered heterojunction structure can enhance surface photocatalytic rate because photogenerated electrons and holes at heterogeneous interface more easily transfer to surface of photocatalysts. Therefore, the obtained ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited better H2-production activity than pure g-C3N4 and WO3 with the same loading amount of Pt as cocatalyst. The mechanism and driving force of charge transfer and separation in S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are investigated and discussed. This investigation will provide new insight about designing and constructing novel S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts.", "Synergistic coupling of CoFe-LDH arrays with NiFe-LDH nanosheet for highly efficient overall water splitting in alkaline media ": "Developing active, stable and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts with earth-abundant metals (Ni, Fe, Co) is a prerequisite to achieve overall water splitting. In this work, a novel CoFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) coupled with NiFe-LDH nanosheet array supported on nickel foam (denoted as CoFe@NiFe/NF) is developed through a facile hydrothermal and electrodeposition method. Remarkably, benefiting from strong synergistic effect between CoFe-LDH and NiFe-LDH and the unique structural features, the resulting CoFe@NiFe/NF architectures catalyst exhibits excellent activities and stabilities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, an efficient and stable alkali-electrolyzer using CoFe@NiFe/NF as both the cathode and anode achieve a voltage of 1.59\u2009V at the current density of 10\u2009mA cm\u22122, which is superior to many other state-of-the-art earth-abundant electrocatalysts.

However, several drawbacks, such as the low-speed generation of Fe(II), high consumption of H2O2, and acidic reaction conditions (generally at \u02dc pH 3), are always the core issues that hamper the large-scale application of heterogeneous Fenton reactions in environmental remediation. Thus, a large number of studies have been devoted to tackling these drawbacks, and this paper intends to comprehensively review the developed strategies for enhancing heterogeneous Fenton reactivity, mainly over the last decade. Based on a comprehensive survey of previous studies, we categorize these strategies according to their reaction mechanisms. For example, introducing additional electrons (e.g., from external electric fields, electron-rich materials, semiconductors, plasmonic materials, or doped metals) to heterogeneous Fenton catalysts can accelerate the generation of Fe(II); the in situ generation of H2O2 can be achieved by combining ultrasound, electricity, semiconductors, and iron-based catalysts in the system; and controlling the specific morphologies and exposed facets of heterogeneous Fenton catalysts can greatly promote the decomposition of H2O2. In addition, we briefly introduce some recent novel heterogeneous Fenton-like reactions that are of particular interest, including constructing dual reaction centers (i.e., the electron-poor center and the electron-rich center) and synthesizing single-atom catalysis-based heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts. Moreover, this review article analyzes and compares the merits of each strategy for enhancing heterogeneous Fenton/Fenton-like reactions. We believe this review can motivate the construction of novel and efficient heterogeneous Fenton/Fenton-like systems and help readers choose proper Fenton/Fenton-like reaction systems for industrial applications.", "Construction of g-C3N4/PDI@MOF heterojunctions for the highly efficient visible light-driven degradation of pharmaceutical and phenolic micropollutants ": "A novel g-C3N4/PDI@MOF heterojunction was synthesized by the in situ growth of NH2-MIL-53(Fe) onto the g-C3N4/PDI layer. The heterojunction was applied as a photocatalyst for the removal of pharmaceutical and phenolic micropollutants in the present of H2O2 and visible LED light (420\u2009<\u2009\u03bb\u2009<\u2009800\u2009nm). The synergistic heterojunction displays excellent photocatalytic performance for the removal of several water-soluble and toxic organic pollutants (50\u2009ppm) under visible light irradiation, with a maximum efficiency of up to 90% (1\u2009h) for tetracycline (TC), 78% (2.5\u2009h) for carbamazepine (CBZ), 100% (10\u2009min) for bisphenol A (BPA) and 100% (30\u2009min) for p-nitrophenol (PNP). Furthermore, the low concentration of phenolic organic pollutants (2\u2009ppm) can also be rapidly degraded into small molecules (analyzed by HPLC) within 10\u2009min. This performance is superior to some previously reported visible-light photocatalysts. The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the efficient formation of heterojunctions derived from the interface contact and electronic band structure matching between g-C3N4/PDI and NH2-MIL-53(Fe), which is beneficial to charge separation and facilitates the photodegradation process. Repeated experimental studies and structural analysis of photocatalyst before and after degradation (XRD and FT-IR) demonstrated that the photocatalyst exhibits good stability and reusability. This work provides a new insight into the construction of heterojunction photocatalysts based on Fe-MOF for the heterogeneous photodegradation of organic contaminants with H2O2 under visible light.", "Cobalt- and nitrogen-codoped porous carbon catalyst made from core\u2013shell type hybrid metal\u2013organic framework (ZIF-L@ZIF-67) and its efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity ": "The development of carbon-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts to substitute the expensive and unstable platinum-based ORR catalysts is of great importance for their optimal utilization in energy conversion and storage. Herein, we report the production of highly active carbon-based ORR catalyst from well-designed core\u2013shell type hybrid metal\u2013organic framework (MOF). Cobalt- and nitrogen-codoped porous carbon leaves (Co,N-PCLs) are prepared via a simple one-step pyrolysis of well-designed leaf-shaped core-shell type hybrid MOFs (ZIF-L@ZIF-67, ZIF (zeolitic imidazolate framework) is a subclass of MOF), which contain two different metal ions (Zn2+ in core and Co2+ in shell) and sufficient nitrogen source with a thin flat morphology. The structural and compositional features of resulting Co,N-PCLs are characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and N2 sorption isotherms, and the analyses reveal that they possess the ideal structural and compositional features for ORR, such as numerous carbon nanotubes (CNTs), substantial Co- and N-doping, large surface area, and high pore volume while maintaining the advantageous thin leaf-shape. Owing to such unique structural and compositional features, Co,N-PCLs display much better ORR activity than their counterparts prepared from the parent materials (ZIF-L or ZIF-67). In addition, Co,N-PCL even shows a better electrochemical stability and a better methanol tolerance compared to commercial Pt/C material.", "Liquid exfoliation of g-C3N4 nanosheets to construct 2D-2D MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity ": "Although graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is an attractive photocatalyst for solar H2 generation, the preparation of g-C3N4 nanosheets via a \u201cgreen\u201d and simple method as well as the construction of highly-efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are still challenges. In this study, g-C3N4 nanosheets prepared by a simple probe sonication assisted liquid exfoliation method were used to construct 2D-2D MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production. The 2D-2D MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst containing 0.75% MoS2 showed the highest H2 evolution rate of 1155 \u03bcmol\u00b7h\u22121\u00b7g\u22121 with an apparent quantum yield of 6.8% at 420 nm monochromatic light, which is much higher than that of the optimized 0D-2D Pt/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The high photocatalytic H2 production activity of 2D-2D MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst can be attributed to the large surface area and the formed 2D interfaces between MoS2 and g-C3N4 nanosheets. As demonstrated by photoluminescence quenching and time-resolved fluorescence decay studies, the 2D interfaces can accelerate the photoinduced charge transfer, resulting in the high photocatalytic H2 production performance. This study provides a new strategy in developing highly-efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for H2 production via using 2D nanojunction as a bridge to promote the photoinduced charge separation and transfer.", "CO oxidation by Pd supported on CeO2(100) and CeO2(111) facets ": "Pd/CeO2 is an active component in emission control catalysts for CO oxidation. Nanostructured CeO2 powders can be prepared in the form of rods exposing predominantly (111) surfaces and cubes exposing (100) surfaces. While differences in the reactivity of Pd supported on these facets of ceria have been reported, the origins of the reactivity differences are not well understood. Pd supported on (111) surfaces of ceria rods exhibits room-temperature CO oxidation activity, while Pd on (100) surface of ceria cubes shows comparable activity at a temperature that is 60\u2009\u00b0C higher. Earlier, we established that Pd/CeO2-rods are active due to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism involving isolated Pd atoms in the form of Pd1O and Pd1O2 species. Here, we establish using in situ CO IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) that, in addition to TEM-visible Pd nanoparticles, Pd/CeO2-cubes also contain isolated Pd species, predominantly in the form of Pd1O. DFT calculations show that CO oxidation proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen pathway, which is possible for the (100) surface because of the lower Ce-O binding energy compared to the (111) surface. Overall, the catalytic cycle for CO oxidation on Pd/CeO2(100) involves a higher free energy barrier than on Pd/CeO2(111) in keeping with the experimentally observed activity difference. EXAFS measurements show that the active Pd phase in both Pd/CeO2-rods and Pd/CeO2-cubes responds dynamically with respect to reducing and oxidizing conditions. The redispersion of Pd in oxidative conditions is more pronounced for Pd/CeO2-rods and the catalyst is more active after an oxidative treatment.", "Porous nitrogen-rich g-C3N4 nanotubes for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction ": "The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuels and valuable chemicals using solar energy is a promising method for reducing CO2 emissions and solving energy supply issues. However, the development of inexpensive, efficient and metal-free materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction is challenging. Herein, we report a facile supramolecular self-assembly strategy for the preparation of porous nitrogen-rich graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanotubes with Lewis basicity and a large surface area, which are beneficial for the adsorption of CO2 and, consequently, the enhancement of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. The metal-free porous nitrogen-rich g-C3N4 nanotubes catalyst exhibits a superior visible-light-induced CO2-to-CO conversion rate of 103.6\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fg\u22121\u202fh\u22121, which is 17 and 15 times higher than those of bulk g-C3N4 (6.1\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fg\u22121\u202fh\u22121) and P25-TiO2 (7.1\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fg\u22121\u202fh\u22121), respectively, and exceeds the performance of most metal-free photocatalysts.

The prepared catalysts were systematically characterized to explore the relationship between their characteristics and catalytic activities. In general, higher specific surface area, larger pore volume, more hydroxyl groups, and more accessible reactive sites of 40%-CuFe2O4/kaolinite contributed to the greater catalytic activity in peroxymonosulfate activation for BPA degradation compared to bare CuFe2O4. Monodispersed CuFe2O4 nanoparticles were uniformly anchored on the surface of kaolinite with FeOAl bond, which prevented leaching of metal ions and contributed to the excellent reusability. The sulfate radicals produced in the CuFe2O4/kaolinite/PMS system were proved as the predominant radical species through electron spin resonance (ESR) and radical quenching experiments. Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance \u2013 Fourier transform infrared spectra (ATR-FTIR), two main possible pathways of sulfate radicals generation were proposed: the generation and decomposition of Cu(II)-(HO)OSO3\n                     \u2212 (Cu(II)/Cu(III) and Cu(III)/Cu(II) redox reaction) and the oxidation of Fe(II). Moreover, the BPA degradation pathway was proposed through the identification of transformation products. This work provides an interesting insight for PMS activation by the high-efficient natural mineral-based catalysts for wastewater reclamation.", "MOF-derived 3D Fe-N-S co-doped carbon matrix/nanotube nanocomposites with advanced oxygen reduction activity and stability in both acidic and alkaline media ": "MOF-derived carbon-based nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to the outstanding electrocatalytic performance, low-cost and super stability. To design an excellent catalyst, Fe, N and S codoped carbon matrix/carbon nanotube nanocomposites (Fe-N-S CNN) are prepared by pyrolysis of ZIF-8 impregnated with iron salt in this work. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of carbon matrix and nanotubes, abundant iron nitrides and thiophene-S active sites, the Fe-N-S CNN exhibits an excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with a half-wave potential of 0.91\u2009V vs. RHE in alkaline conditions and 0.78\u2009V vs. RHE in acidic conditions, while those of commercial Pt/C catalysts are 0.85\u2009V vs. RHE and 0.795\u2009V vs. RHE, respectively.

Its photocatalytic H2-production performance was tested. Mass ratio of CdS acted a pivotal part in light absorption and photocatalytic properties. Noticeably, promoted photocatalytic H2-production activity of 4134\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009g\u22121\u2009h-1 was achieved by the sample with optimal CdS content. Significantly, the photoluminescence (PL) detection of hydroxyl radicals, as well as the in-situ XPS measurements was selected to verify the direct Z-scheme charge migration mechanism. This mechanism endowed the composite with strong capability for hydrogen evolution and elucidated the improved photocatalytic performance. The improvement of photocatalytic activity was due to hierarchical structure, extended visible light response and direct Z-scheme mechanism. This work will give an innovative vision in constructing direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system with great photocatalytic H2-production activity.", "Metal-organic framework derived Co3O4/MoS2 heterostructure for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction ": "Fabrication of highly efficient, sustainable and low-cost nonprecious metal oxide for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is exceedingly challenging and warranted for overall water splitting. Herein, we synthesized cobalt nanoleaves metal-organic framed work (MOF) on nickel foam substrate with uniform growth. After calcination of Co-MOF, molybdenum disulfide nanosheets is grown by a facial hydrothermal method. The as-prepared heterostructure (Co3O4/MoS2) can act as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Under optimized condition, synthesized Co3O4/MoS2 heterostructure catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity for both OER and HER in 1\u2009M KOH solution with a current density of 20\u2009mA cm\u22122 at overpotential of 230\u2009mV for OER and 205\u2009mV for HER (@ j\u2009=\u200910\u2009mA cm\u22122) and Tafel slopes of 45 and 98\u2009mV dec-1, respectively. The superior catalytic activity for both OER and HER arises from the unique heterostructure of Co3O4/MoS2 and the synergistic effects of Co3O4 and MoS2.", "A review on the visible light active titanium dioxide photocatalysts for environmental applications ": "Fujishima and Honda (1972) demonstrated the potential of titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor materials to split water into hydrogen and oxygen in a photo-electrochemical cell. Their work triggered the development of semiconductor photocatalysis for a wide range of environmental and energy applications. One of the most significant scientific and commercial advances to date has been the development of visible light active (VLA) TiO2 photocatalytic materials. In this review, a background on TiO2 structure, properties and electronic properties in photocatalysis is presented. The development of different strategies to modify TiO2 for the utilization of visible light, including non metal and/or metal doping, dye sensitization and coupling semiconductors are discussed. Emphasis is given to the origin of visible light absorption and the reactive oxygen species generated, deduced by physicochemical and photoelectrochemical methods. Various applications of VLA TiO2, in terms of environmental remediation and in particular water treatment, disinfection and air purification, are illustrated. Comprehensive studies on the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants of emerging concern, including endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, cyanotoxins and volatile organic compounds, with VLA TiO2 are discussed and compared to conventional UV-activated TiO2 nanomaterials. Recent advances in bacterial disinfection using VLA TiO2 are also reviewed. Issues concerning test protocols for real visible light activity and photocatalytic efficiencies with different light sources have been highlighted.", "0D/3D MoS2-NiS2/N-doped graphene foam composite for efficient overall water splitting ": "Electrochemical water splitting is strongly dependent on mass transport and active sites, however, the difficulty in facilitating mass transport and exposing sufficient active sites is the major bottleneck for both half reactions of the overall water splitting, i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To address these two issues, a facile and economical strategy is demonstrated for the preparation of the bimetallic sulfides anchored three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped graphene foam (MoS2-NiS2/NGF) hybrid for efficient overall water splitting. As a result, strong interactions occur between MoS2-NiS2 nanoparticles and NGF with unique 3D interconnected tubular hollow structure, leading to the superior performance towards HER and OER. The overpotential and charge transfer resistance of the hybrid are much lower than those of the bare NGF, MoS2/NGF, NiS2/NGF, and physically mixed MoS2-NiS2 + NGF, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of NGF and bimetallic sulfides with hetero interfaces, thus endowing MoS2-NiS2/NGF abundant active sites and diversified pathways for highly-efficient transport of mass and electron. This bifunctional catalyst also exhibits excellent overall water splitting capability with a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 at 1.64 V, which provides a platform for the synthesis of large-scale and cost-efficient catalysts for water splitting.", "Fabrication of Bi2MoO6/ZnO hierarchical heterostructures with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity ": "The construction of heterostructures is regarded as an excellent strategy to achieve efficient charge separation and improved photocatalytic activity. Herein, a series of Bi2MoO6/ZnO hierarchical heterostructured photocatalysts were synthesized by a solvothermal method. The morphology of Bi2MoO6 grown on the surface of ZnO nanorods could be controlled by adjusting the experimental conditions. The synthesized samples were characterized by various analytical techniques and their photocatalytic performance was evaluated by photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) under visible-light irradiation. Compared with those of pure Bi2MoO6 and ZnO, the Bi2MoO6/ZnO composites showed higher photocatalytic activity towards the reduction of Cr(VI). The enhanced photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to the formation of a heterojunction between Bi2MoO6 and ZnO, which effectively facilitated the separation and transfer of electrons and holes. In addition, the Bi2MoO6/ZnO photocatalysts maintained good stability after three cycles of Cr(VI) photoreduction. A possible photocatalytic mechanism of the as-synthesized composites was proposed.", "Activated TiO2 with tuned vacancy for efficient electrochemical nitrogen reduction ": "Renewable energy-driven electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) provides a green and sustainable route for NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions but is plagued by a high reaction barrier and low selectivity. To promote NRR, modification of the catalyst surface to increase N2 adsorption and activation is key. Here, we show that engineering surface oxygen vacancies of TiO2 permits significantly enhanced NRR activity with an NH3 yield rate of about 3.0 \u03bcgNH3\u202fh\u22121 mgcat.\n                     \u22121 and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 6.5% at -0.12\u202fV (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Efficient conversion of N2 to NH3 is achieved in a wide applied potential range from -0.07 to -0.22\u202fV (vs. RHE) with NH3 production rates \u2265 2.0 \u03bcgNH3\u202fh\u22121 mgcat.\n                     -1 and NH3 FEs \u2265 4.9%, respectively. An NH3 FE as high as 9.8% is obtained at a low overpotential of 80\u202fmV. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the surface oxygen vacancies in TiO2 play a vital role in facilitating electrochemical N2 reduction by activating the first protonation step and also increasing N2 chemisorption (relative to *H).", "One-pot synthesis of porous 1T-phase MoS2 integrated with single-atom Cu doping for enhancing electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction ": "Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has attracted great interest as a promising non-precious-metal catalyst candidate to replace the precious-metal Pt catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Nevertheless, the catalytic efficiency of MoS2 is significantly restricted by its density of catalytic active sites and inert basal plane. In this work, we have designed a facile one-pot solvothermal method to synthesize porous 1T-MoS2 that is integrated with atomic doping of Cu atoms. The as-prepared Cu@MoS2 sample exhibits enhanced HER performance with a low overpotential of 131 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2, a small Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec and as well as a good long-term stability. Enhanced HER performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of 1T-MoS2 metallic phase, single atom Cu doping and numerous sulfur vacancies. Theoretical calculations indicates that the adsorption energy of Cu atom on 1T-MoS2 surface (\u22123.68 eV) is much higher than that on 2H-MoS2 surface (\u22121.94 eV), moreover, the Cu atom adsorbed on the surface of the 1T-MoS2 has larger charge transfer (\u22120.38e), which can be contributed to further enhance HER performance of 1T-MoS2.", "One-step in-situ preparation of N-doped TiO2@C derived from Ti3C2 MXene for enhanced visible-light driven photodegradation ": "As the most promising environment-friendly photocatalyst, titanium dioxide admittedly has two shortcomings of low sunlight utilization efficiency and poor quantum yield. Nitrogen doping and TiO2 loading on carbon materials can improve the above two problems, respectively. But a facile synthetic method for titanium dioxide composites with stable structure and high visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity is still desired by researchers. Herein we obtained two-dimensional layered nitrogen-doped carbon-supported titanium dioxides (N-TiO2@C) via a one-step in-situ fabrication way from a novel two-dimensional layered transition metal carbide Ti3C2 MXene as carbon skeleton and homologous titanium source. Based on the negatively charged and easily oxidized property of Ti3C2 MXene, it was assembled with nitrogen-containing cationic compound via electrostatic interactions and then in-situ transformed into nitrogen-doped carbon-supported TiO2 in a CO2 atmosphere at 550\u2009\u00b0C. The obtained composites of porous 2D layered N-TiO2@C with high stability, outstanding electron transfer performance and excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity exhibits the high efficiency of phenol degradation with the apparent rate constant k of 1.646\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22122\u2009min\u22121. It provides a facile new method for the preparation of visible-light-driven titanium dioxide with excellent catalytic performance, structural stability and good application prospects in the environmental purification.", "Recent development in graphitic carbon nitride based photocatalysis for hydrogen generation ": "The future energy crisis and environmental degradation can only mitigate by harvesting solar energy into renewable, safe, economical and clean technology like water splitting. The graphitic carbon nitride has an attractive band structure, good chemical stability, earth-abundant and significantly easily fabricated which makes an application for the generation of hydrogen by water splitting. In this paper, we try to critically focus on the current progress and future development of the different strategies of water splitting using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for hydrogen generation. In this context, we discuss recent strategies like metal and non-metal doping (electronic structure), morphology tuning (geometric structuring), use of mediators (Z-scheme technology), defects engineering, plasmonic materials, dye-sensitization, perovskite oxides, carbon nitrides, carbon dots, metal organic framework, and a bimetallic cocatalyst. Finally, we summarize the recent advances and future developments of g-C3N4 bases photocatalysis.", "Installing earth-abundant metal active centers to covalent organic frameworks for efficient heterogeneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction ": "Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into energy carriers has been recognized as a highly promising strategy for achieving the virtuous carbon cycle in nature. The realization of this process depends on an efficient catalyst to reduce the reaction barrier. Herein, we report a series of transition metal ion modified crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for the heterogeneous photocatalytic reduction of CO2. By coordinating different kinds of open metal active species into COFs, the resultant DQTP (2,6-diaminoanthraquinone - 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol) COF-M (M\u2009=\u2009Co/Ni/Zn) exerts a strong influence on the activity and selectivity of products (CO or HCOOH). Significantly, DQTP COF-Co exhibits a high CO production rate of 1.02\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 \u03bcmol h\u22121\u2009g\u22121, while DQTP COF-Zn has a high selectivity (90% over CO) for formic acid generation (152.5\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009h\u22121\u2009g\u22121). This work highlights the great potential of using stable COFs as platforms to anchor earth-abundant metal active sites for heterogeneous CO2 reduction.", "Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes: A review on their application to synthetic and real wastewaters ": "Over the last decades, research efforts have been made at developing more effective technologies for the remediation of waters containing persistent organic pollutants. Among the various technologies, the so-called electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have caused increasing interest. These technologies are based on the electrochemical generation of strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals (OH). Here, we present an exhaustive review on the treatment of various synthetic and real wastewaters by five key EAOPs, i.e., anodic oxidation (AO), anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (AO-H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF), photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) and solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF), alone and in combination with other methods like biological treatment, electrocoagulation, coagulation and membrane filtration processes. Fundamentals of each EAOP are also given.", "Tremella-like Ni3S2/MnS with ultrathin nanosheets and abundant oxygen vacancies directly used for high speed overall water splitting ": "The development of highly active and stable non-noble metal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional performances is crucial for efficient water splitting. In this work, such electrocatalysts are obtained, first in two-step hydrothermal reactions to form Ni3S2/MnS nanosheets on Ni foam (NF/Ni3S2/MnS), then by slightly electroxidizing the Ni3S2/MnS to generate tremella-like Ni3S2/MnS-O with ultrathin nanosheets and abundant oxygen vacancies (denoted as NF/T(Ni3S2/MnS-O)) favorable for electrocatalyzing HER and OER. Benefiting from the abundant oxygen vacancies, tremella-like ultrathin nanosheets with hierarchical porous structure and large active surface area, NF/T(Ni3S2/MnS-O) shows high catalytic performance, including lower overpotential and electrochemistry stability for both HER and OER than so far reported MnOx and other metal oxides/sulfides. The NF/T(Ni3S2/MnS-O) directly used as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting exhibits a low voltage of 1.54\u202fV with a low overpotential of 0.31\u202fV at a current density of 10\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122, a fast H2 and O2 evolution speed of 4.13 and 2.04\u202f\u03bcmol min\u22121 and a good electrochemistry stability with unchanged current density of 10\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122 for 50 h.", "Sulfur-doped g-C3N4 with enhanced photocatalytic CO2-reduction performance ": "Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is the most stable phase of all carbon nitride allotropes under ambient conditions. In this study, sulfur-doped g-C3N4 was fabricated by simply calcinating thiourea at 520\u00b0C. Sulfur-doped g-C3N4 (TCN) was found to absorb light up to 475nm corresponding to a band gap of 2.63eV, which was narrower than that of un-doped g-C3N4 (MCN) with a band gap of 2.7eV. First-principle calculations based on spin-polarized density functional theory were utilized to investigate the theoretical partial density of states of the TCN and MCN, indicating that the band gaps of TCN and MCN were the same, but impurities existed in the TCN sample. Consequently, photogenerated electrons could easily jump from the impurity state to the conduction band or from the valence band to the impurity state. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction was further used to evaluate the photoactivity of samples, and the CH3OH yield using TCN and MCN were 1.12 and 0.81\u03bcmolg\u22121, respectively. PL spectrum analysis and transient photocurrent responses were also carried out to verify the suggested photocatalysis mechanism.", "In-situ pyrolysis of Enteromorpha as carbocatalyst for catalytic removal of organic contaminants: Considering the intrinsic N/Fe in Enteromorpha and non-radical reaction ": "An environmentally friendly, facile, and economical Fe/N co-doped carbonaceous material (Fe-N@C) was prepared by the in-situ pyrolysis of Fe/N rich Enteromorpha biomass for peroxymonosulfate activation and organic contaminants degradation. Results indicated that Enteromorpha-based catalysts prepared at high pyrolysis temperature displayed some highly graphitic nanosheets with rich nitrogen doped. The graphitic N derived from the intrinsic N in Enteromorpha showed the high correlation with the paracetamol (PCM) removal rate; this was confirmed by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation, showing the high adsorption energy (\u0394Eads, \u22122.62\u2009eV) of PMS molecular adsorbed onto the graphitic N area. A weak correlation between the PCM removal rate and adsorption capacity was also observed, revealing that the PCM catalytic reaction could be greatly accelerated after the pre-adsorption. It was interesting that the intrinsic Fe in Enteromorpha did not affect the PCM degradation, but PCM removal rate of acid treated Fe-N/C was improved as more active sites were formed after the Fe extraction by acid treatment. Both the radical pathways of O2\n                     \n                        \n                     \n                     \u2212 and non-radical 1O2 generated in the Fe-N@C/PMS system were the primary mechanisms for the PCM degradation, which was consistent with the Fukui function values of f\u00b0 and f- based on the DFT calculation. In addition, high stability of the carbon-based catalysts was observed after three runs and calcinating regeneration, which showed the promising applications for environmental remediation.", "Microplastics accumulate on pores in seed capsule and delay germination and root growth of the terrestrial vascular plant Lepidium sativum\n             ": "The impacts of nano- and microplastics (<100\u202fnm and <5\u202fmm, respectively) on terrestrial systems is to the present largely unexplored. Plastic particles are likely to accumulate in these systems primarily by the application of sewage sludge. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of three sizes of plastic particles (50, 500, and 4800\u202fnm) on a terrestrial plant (cress; Lepidium sativum), using a standardized 72\u202fh bioassay. Cress seeds were exposed to five different concentrations of plastics, ranging from 103 to 107 particles mL\u22121. Germination rate was significantly reduced after 8\u202fh of exposure for all three sizes of plastics, with increased adverse effect with increasing plastic sizes. Seeds exposed to 4800\u202fnm microplastics showed a germination rate decline from 78% in control to 17% in the highest exposure. No difference in germination rate occurred after 24\u202fh of exposure, regardless of the size of the plastic used. Significant differences in root growth were observed after 24\u202fh, but not after 48 or 72\u202fh of exposure. Impacts on germination are likely due to physical blockage of the pores in the seed capsule by microplastics as shown by confocal microscopy of fluorescent microplastics. In later stages, the microplastics particularly accumulated on the root hairs. This is the first detailed study on the effect of nano- and microplastics on a vascular, terrestrial plant, and our results indicate short-term and transient adverse effects.", "Mechanisms of metal sorption by biochars: Biochar characteristics and modifications ": "Biochar produced by thermal decomposition of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions has received increasing attention as a cost-effective sorbent to treat metal-contaminated waters. However, there is a lack of information on the roles of different sorption mechanisms for different metals and recent development of biochar modification to enhance metal sorption capacity, which is critical for biochar field application. This review summarizes the characteristics of biochar (e.g., surface area, porosity, pH, surface charge, functional groups, and mineral components) and main mechanisms governing sorption of As, Cr, Cd, Pb, and Hg by biochar. Biochar properties vary considerably with feedstock material and pyrolysis temperature, with high temperature producing biochars with higher surface area, porosity, pH, and mineral contents, but less functional groups. Different mechanisms dominate sorption of As (complexation and electrostatic interactions), Cr (electrostatic interactions, reduction, and complexation), Cd and Pb (complexation, cation exchange, and precipitation), and Hg (complexation and reduction). Besides sorption mechanisms, recent advance in modifying biochar by loading with minerals, reductants, organic functional groups, and nanoparticles, and activation with alkali solution to enhance metal sorption capacity is discussed. Future research needs for field application of biochar include competitive sorption mechanisms of co-existing metals, biochar reuse, and cost reduction of biochar production.", "Biochar as a sorbent for contaminant management in soil and water: A review ": "Biochar is a stable carbon-rich by-product synthesized through pyrolysis/carbonization of plant- and animal-based biomass. An increasing interest in the beneficial application of biochar has opened up multidisciplinary areas for science and engineering. The potential biochar applications include carbon sequestration, soil fertility improvement, pollution remediation, and agricultural by-product/waste recycling. The key parameters controlling its properties include pyrolysis temperature, residence time, heat transfer rate, and feedstock type. The efficacy of biochar in contaminant management depends on its surface area, pore size distribution and ion-exchange capacity. Physical architecture and molecular composition of biochar could be critical for practical application to soil and water. Relatively high pyrolysis temperatures generally produce biochars that are effective in the sorption of organic contaminants by increasing surface area, microporosity, and hydrophobicity; whereas the biochars obtained at low temperatures are more suitable for removing inorganic/polar organic contaminants by oxygen-containing functional groups, electrostatic attraction, and precipitation. However, due to complexity of soil\u2013water system in nature, the effectiveness of biochars on remediation of various organic/inorganic contaminants is still uncertain. In this review, a succinct overview of current biochar use as a sorbent for contaminant management in soil and water is summarized and discussed.", "Removal of heavy metals from water sources in the developing world using low-cost materials: A review ": "Heavy metal contamination is a growing concern in the developing world. Inadequate water and wastewater treatment, coupled with increased industrial activity, have led to increased heavy metal contamination in rivers, lakes, and other water sources in developing countries. However, common methods for removing heavy metals from water sources, including membrane filtration, activated carbon adsorption, and electrocoagulation, are not feasible for developing countries. As a result, a significant amount of research has been conducted on low-cost adsorbents to evaluate their ability to remove heavy metals. In this review article, we summarize the current state of research on the removal of heavy metals with an emphasis on low-cost adsorbents that are feasible in the context of the developing world. This review evaluates the use of adsorbents from four major categories: agricultural waste; naturally-occurring soil and mineral deposits; aquatic and terrestrial biomass; and other locally-available waste materials. Along with a summary of the use of these adsorbents in the removal of heavy metals, this article provides a summary of the influence of various water-quality parameters on heavy metals and these adsorbents. The proposed adsorption mechanisms for heavy metal removal are also discussed.", "A review of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in the indoor environment: occurrence in consumer products, indoor air and dust ": "As many people spend a large part of their life indoors, the quality of the indoor environment is important. Data on contaminants such as flame retardants, pesticides and plasticizers are available for indoor air and dust but are scarce for consumer products such as computers, televisions, furniture, carpets, etc.\n                  This review presents information on semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in consumer products in an attempt to link the information available for chemicals in indoor air and dust with their indoor sources. A number of 256 papers were selected and divided among SVOCs found in consumer products (n\u202f=\u202f57), indoor dust (n\u202f=\u202f104) and air (n\u202f=\u202f95). Concentrations of SVOCs in consumer products, indoor dust and air are reported (e.g. PFASs max: 13.9\u202f\u03bcg/g in textiles, 5.8\u202f\u03bcg/kg in building materials, 121\u202fng/g in house dust and 6.4\u202fng/m3 in indoor air). Most of the studies show common aims, such as human exposure and risk assessment. The main micro-environments investigated (houses, offices and schools) reflect the relevance of indoor air quality. Most of the studies show a lack of data on concentrations of chemicals in consumer goods and often only the presence of chemicals is reported. At the moment this is the largest obstacle linking chemicals in products to chemicals detected in indoor air and dust.", "The fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), endocrine disrupting contaminants (EDCs), metabolites and illicit drugs in a WWTW and environmental waters ": "A large number of emerging contaminants (ECs) are known to persist in surface waters, and create pressure on wastewater treatment works (WWTW) for their effective removal. Although a large database for the levels of these pollutants in water systems exist globally, there is still a lack in the correlation of the levels of these pollutants with possible long-term adverse health effects in wildlife and humans, such as endocrine disruption. The current study detected a total of 55\u00a0ECs in WWTW influent surface water, 41\u00a0ECs in effluent, and 40\u00a0ECs in environmental waters located upstream and downstream of the plant. A list of ECs persisted through the WWTW process, with 28% of all detected ECs removed by less than 50%, and 18% of all ECs were removed by less than 25%. Negative mass balances of some pharmaceuticals and metabolites were observed within the WWTW, suggesting possible back-transformation of ECs during wastewater treatment. Three parental illicit drug compounds were detected within the influent of the WWTW, with concentrations ranging between 27.6 and 147.0\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 for cocaine, 35.6\u2013120.6\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 for mephedrone, and 270.9\u2013450.2\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 for methamphetamine. The related environmental risks are also discussed for some ECs, with particular reference to their ability to disrupt endocrine systems. The current study propose the potential of the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen to be regarded as priority ECs for environmental monitoring due to their regular detection and persistence in environmental waters and their possible contribution towards adverse health effects in humans and wildlife.", "Characterisation of nanoplastics during the degradation of polystyrene ": "The release of plastics into the environment has been identified as an important issue for some time. Recent publications have suggested that the degradation of plastic materials will result in the release of nano-sized plastic particles to the environment. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was applied to characterise the formation of nanoplastics during the degradation of a polystyrene (PS) disposable coffee cup lid. The results clearly show an increase in the formation of nanoplastics over time. After 56 days' exposure the concentration of nanoplastics in the PS sample was 1.26\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0particles/ml (average particles size 224\u00a0nm) compared to 0.41\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0particles/ml in the control.", "Phytoremediation of heavy metals\u2014Concepts and applications ": "The mobilization of heavy metals by man through extraction from ores and processing for different applications has led to the release of these elements into the environment. Since heavy metals are nonbiodegradable, they accumulate in the environment and subsequently contaminate the food chain. This contamination poses a risk to environmental and human health. Some heavy metals are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and endocrine disruptors while others cause neurological and behavioral changes especially in children. Thus remediation of heavy metal pollution deserves due attention. Different physical and chemical methods used for this purpose suffer from serious limitations like high cost, intensive labor, alteration of soil properties and disturbance of soil native microflora. In contrast, phytoremediation is a better solution to the problem. Phytoremediation is the use of plants and associated soil microbes to reduce the concentrations or toxic effects of contaminants in the environments. It is a relatively recent technology and is perceived as cost-effective, efficient, novel, eco-friendly, and solar-driven technology with good public acceptance. Phytoremediation is an area of active current research. New efficient metal hyperaccumulators are being explored for applications in phytoremediation and phytomining. Molecular tools are being used to better understand the mechanisms of metal uptake, translocation, sequestration and tolerance in plants. This review article comprehensively discusses the background, concepts and future trends in phytoremediation of heavy metals.", "Activated persulfate for organic chemical degradation: A review ": "Activated persulfate reactions have widespread application for groundwater and environmental remediation, as many of these reactions involve destruction of environmental contaminants. Within the last five years, knowledge of activated persulfate degradation reactions has grown to include novel means of activating persulfate for enhanced removal of organic species. These current studies cover a long list of organic analytes, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, halogenated compounds and dyes. An extensive review of recently published experimental parameters and results for the destruction of organic compounds via activated persulfate is presented. Focus is placed on emerging methodologies and manipulation of traditional activation techniques. Knowledge gaps are identified and discussed, as despite the number of publications on this subject, more broad-reaching guidelines are needed for optimizing applications of activated persulfate in water treatment.", "Occurrence of pesticides in Dutch drinking water sources ": "We determined pesticide occurrence in groundwater and surface water sources used for drinking water production in The Netherlands, using both routine monitoring data from Dutch drinking water companies and by studying the presence of newly authorized pesticides in drinking water sources.\n                  An analytical LC-MS/MS method was developed for 24 recently authorized pesticides, selected based on their mobility and persistence, and applied in a Dutch/Belgian ground- and surface water monitoring campaign. 15 of these pesticides were detected, including seven in concentrations above the water quality standard from the Water Framework Directive. Two neonicotinoids were detected in highest concentrations: acetamiprid (1.1\u202f\u03bcg/L) and thiamethoxam (0.4\u202f\u03bcg/L).\n                  The routine monitoring data was collected over 2010\u20132014 in The Netherlands, covering 408 pesticides and 52 metabolites. 63 pesticides and 6 metabolites were prioritized according to their presence in groundwater, surface water and drinking water. The vast majority of the pesticides in routine monitoring has not been detected or only in low concentrations.\n                  Overall, the study shows that pesticides are of major concern in drinking water sources across the Netherlands. In two third of the abstraction areas pesticides and/or metabolites have been detected. In one third of the abstraction areas pesticide and/or metabolites concentration exceeded water quality standards according to the Water Framework Directive. The results emphasize that monitoring should focus on priority pesticides, since the vast majority of the pesticides has a low priority. The occurrence of recently authorized pesticides in drinking water sources demonstrates the importance to keep routine monitoring methods up to date.", "Toxicity of leachate from weathering plastics: An exploratory screening study with Nitocra spinipes\n             ": "Between 60% and 80% of all marine litter is plastic. Leachate from plastics has previously been shown to cause acute toxicity in the freshwater species Daphnia magna. Here, we present an initial screening of the marine environmental hazard properties of leachates from weathering plastics to the marine harpacticoid copepod [Crustacea] Nitocra spinipes. Twenty-one plastic products made of different polymeric materials were leached and irradiated with artificial sunlight. Eight of the twenty-one plastics (38%) produced leachates that caused acute toxicity. Differences in toxicity were seen for different plastic products, and depending on the duration of irradiation. There was no consistent trend in how toxicity of leachate from plastics changed as a function of irradiation time. Leachate from four plastics became significantly more toxic after irradiation, two became significantly less toxic and two did not change significantly. Analysis of leachates from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) by liquid chromatography coupled to a full-scan high-resolution mass spectrometer showed that the leachates were a mixture of substances, but did not show evidence of degradation of the polymer backbone. This screening study demonstrates that leachates from different plastics differ in toxicity to N. spinipes and that the toxicity varies under simulated weathering.", "Sorption of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) to an organic soil horizon \u2013 Effect of cation composition and pH ": "Accurate prediction of the sorption of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in soils is essential for environmental risk assessment. We investigated the effect of solution pH and calculated soil organic matter (SOM) net charge on the sorption of 14 PFASs onto an organic soil as a function of pH and added concentrations of Al3+, Ca2+ and Na+. Often, the organic C-normalized partitioning coefficients (K\n                     \n                        OC\n                     ) showed a negative relationship to both pH (\u0394log K\n                     \n                        OC\n                     /\u0394pH\u202f=\u202f\u22120.32\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.11 log units) and the SOM bulk net negative charge (\u0394log K\n                     \n                        OC\n                     \u202f=\u202f\u22121.41\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.40 per log unit molc g\u22121). Moreover, perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs) sorbed more strongly than perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and the PFAS sorption increased with increasing perfluorocarbon chain length with 0.60 and 0.83 log K\n                     \n                        OC\n                      units per CF2 moiety for C3\u2013C10 PFCAs and C4, C6, and C8 PFSAs, respectively. The effects of cation treatment and SOM bulk net charge were evident for many PFASs with low to moderate sorption (C5\u2013C8 PFCAs and C6 PFSA). However for the most strongly sorbing and most long-chained PFASs (C9\u2013C11 and C13 PFCAs, C8 PFSA and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA)), smaller effects of cations were seen, and instead sorption was more strongly related to the pH value. This suggests that the most long-chained PFASs, similar to other hydrophobic organic compounds, are preferentially sorbed to the highly condensed domains of the humin fraction, while shorter-chained PFASs are bound to a larger extent to humic and fulvic acid, where cation effects are significant.", "Zinc and iron oxide nanoparticles improved the plant growth and reduced the oxidative stress and cadmium concentration in wheat ": "The effects of seed priming with zinc oxide (ZnO) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles (NPs) on the growth and cadmium (Cd) accumulation by wheat (Triticum aestivum) were investigated. Seeds of wheat were primed with different concentrations of either ZnO NPs (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121) or Fe NPs (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121) for 24\u202fh by continuous aeration and then the seeds were sown in a soil which was contaminated with Cd due to long-term application of sewage water. Plants were grown till maturity under natural conditions with 60\u201370% moisture contents of total soil water holding capacity throughout the experiment. Plant height, spike length, and dry weights of shoots, roots, spikes, and grains were increased with NPs, in particular with the higher rates of NPs. The results depicted that NPs positively affected the photosynthesis of wheat as compared to the control. The NPs reduced the electrolyte leakage and superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities in leaves of Cd-stressed wheat. The concentrations of Cd in roots, shoots, and grains were significantly decreased with NPs application. The Cd content in the grains was below the threshold level of Cd (0.2\u202fmg\u202fkg\u22121) for cereals when the seeds were treated with higher NPs treatments. The application of ZnO NPs increased the Zn concentrations and Fe NPs increased the Fe concentrations in roots, shoots, and grains. Overall, the NPs play a major role in the increase in biomass, nutrients and decrease in Cd toxicity in wheat.", "The PFOA substitute GenX detected in the environment near a fluoropolymer manufacturing plant in the Netherlands ": "The ban on perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has led to the production and use of alternative fluorinated compounds such as GenX. Limited information is available on the occurrence of this PFOA substitute. In this pilot study, we investigated the presence of GenX in/on grass and leaf samples collected near a fluoropolymer manufacturing plant in the Netherlands and in drinking water produced from surface and surface-water influenced groundwater intake points within 25\u202fkm from the plant. GenX was detected in/on all grass and leaf samples collected within 3\u202fkm north-east from the plant, with levels ranging from 1 to 27\u202fng/g wet weight (ww) and 4.3\u201386\u202fng/g ww, respectively. The PFOA levels in/on grass and leaves were lower, ranging from 0.7 to 11\u202fng/g ww and 0.9\u201328\u202fng/g ww, respectively. A declining concentration gradient of GenX and PFOA with increasing distance from the plant was observed, which suggests that the plant is a point source of GenX and was a point source for PFOA in the past. In all drinking water samples, GenX and PFOA were detected with levels ranging from 1.4 to 8.0\u202fng/L and 1.9\u20137.1\u202fng/L, respectively. The detection of GenX, which is only used since 2012, in/on grass and leaves and in drinking water indicates that GenX is now distributed through the environment. The presence of GenX and PFOA in/on grass and leaves within 3\u202fkm north-east of the plant also suggests that these chemicals could also be present on the locally grown food in gardens around the factory.", "Graphene and graphene-based nanocomposites used for antibiotics removal in water treatment: A review ": "Due to their extensive application in human and veterinary medicine, antibiotics have been found worldwide and studied as new pollutants in the aquatic environment. In order to remove such pollutants, adsorption and photocatalysis have attracted tremendous attention because of their great potential in antibiotics removal from aqueous solutions. Graphene, as a novel two-dimensional nanomaterial, possesses unique structure and physicochemical properties, which can be used to efficiently adsorb and photodegrade antibiotics. This review provides an overview of the adsorptive and catalytic properties of graphene, and recent advances in adsorption and photodegradation of antibiotics by graphene and its derivatives. The factors that affect the adsorption and photodegradation of antibiotics are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of adsorption and photodegradation are summarized and analyzed. Meanwhile, statistical analysis is conducted based on the number of papers and the maximum adsorption and photodegradation ability on various antibiotics removal. Finally, some unsolved problems together with major challenges that exist in the fabrication and application of graphene-based nanocomposites and the development for antibiotics removal is also proposed. This work provides theoretical guidance for subsequent research in the field of adsorption and photocatalytic removal of antibiotics from aqueous solution, especially on influence factors and mechanisms aspects.", "Phytoremediation strategies for soils contaminated with heavy metals: Modifications and future perspectives ": "Presence of heavy metals in agricultural soils is of major environmental concern and a great threat to life on the earth. A number of human health risks are associated with heavy metals regarding their entry into food chain. Various physical, chemical and biological techniques are being used to remove heavy metals and metalloids from soils. Among them, phytoremediation is a good strategy to harvest heavy metals from soils and have been proven as an effective and economical technique. In present review, we discussed various sources and harmful effects of some important heavy metals and metalloids, traditional phytoremediation strategies, mechanisms involved in phytoremediation of these metals, limitations and some recent advances in phytoremediation approaches. Since traditional phytoremediation approach poses some limitations regarding their applications at large scale, so there is a dire need to modify this strategy using modern chemical, biological and genetic engineering tools. In view of above, the present manuscript brings both traditional and advanced phytoremediation techniques together in order to compare, understand and apply these strategies effectively to exclude heavy metals from soil keeping in view the economics and effectiveness of phytoremediation strategies.", "Waste incineration of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to evaluate potential formation of per- and Poly-Fluorinated Alkyl Substances (PFAS) in flue gas ": "In recent years, concerns over some per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) have grown steadily. PFAS are a large group of chemical substances with widely differing properties. While one class of PFAS, fluoropolymers, have been demonstrated to meet the OECD criteria for polymers of low concern during the in use phase of their lifecycle, questions remain regarding waste handling at the end of useful life for products containing fluoropolymers. To show that polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) can be almost fully transformed into fluorine (F) (as hydrofluoric acid (HF)) and to study the possible generation of low molecular weight per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), PTFE combustion under typical waste incineration conditions at the BRENDA (German acronym for \u201cBrennkammer mit Dampfkessel\u201d) pilot plant at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) was investigated. Results indicate that, within procedural quantitation limits, no statistically significant evidence was found that the PFAS studied were created during the incineration of PTFE. Therefore, municipal incineration of PTFE using best available technologies (BAT) is not a significant source of the studied PFAS and should be considered an acceptable form of waste treatment.", "Application of biochar for the removal of pollutants from aqueous solutions ": "In recent years, many studies have been devoted to investigate the application of biochar for pollutants removal from aqueous solutions. Biochar exhibits a great potential to efficiently tackle water contaminants considering the wide availability of feedstock, low-cost and favorable physical/chemical surface characteristics. This review provides an overview of biochar production technologies, biochar properties, and recent advances in the removal of heavy metals, organic pollutants and other inorganic pollutants using biochar. Experimental studies related to the adsorption behaviors of biochar toward various contaminants, key affecting factors and the underlying mechanisms proposed to explain the adsorption behaviors, have been comprehensively reviewed. Furthermore, research gaps and uncertainties that exist in the use of biochar as an adsorbent are identified. Further research needs for biochar and potential areas for future application of biochars are also proposed.", "Water-stable metal-organic frameworks for aqueous removal of heavy metals and radionuclides: A review ": "Heavy metals and radionuclides in water are a global environmental issue, which has been receiving considerable attention worldwide. Water-stable MOFs are green and recyclable materials to eliminate the environmental impacts caused by the hazardous heavy metal ions and radionuclides in water. This paper presents a systematical review on the current status of water-stable MOFs that capture and convert a wide range of heavy metal ions (e.g., As(III)/As(V), Pb(II), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Cr(III)/Cr(VI)) and radionuclides (e.g., U(VI), Se(IV)/Se(VI) and Cs(I)) in aqueous solution. Water-stable MOFs and MOF-based composites exhibit the superior adsorption capability for these metal species in water. Significantly, MOFs show high selectivity in capturing target metal ions even in the presence of multiple water constituents. Mechanisms involved in capturing metal ions are described. MOFs also have excellent catalytic performance (photocatalysis and catalytic reduction by formic acid) for Cr(VI) conversion to Cr(III). Future research is suggested to provide insightful guidance to enhance the performance of the MOFs in capturing target pollutants in aquatic environment.", "A prototype of a portable optical sensor for the detection of transparent and translucent microplastics in freshwater ": "Microplastic pollution in water bodies is an alarming problem which needs to be addressed. However, issues such as size, shape and their appearance to light (transparent or translucent) make it difficult to be optically detected. Here, a feasibility study of a portable prototype optical sensor with the capability of measuring simultaneously specular laser light reflection and transmission from microplastic particles is presented. The specular reflection signal and the transmitted interference pattern were recorded with a photodiode and a CCD camera, respectively. With the combination of these two modes of detection, it is possible to screen the type, size, and nonplanarity of two microplastics types, i.e., transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and translucent low-density polyethylene (LDPE), in a volume of freshwater, with high confidence. In principle, the prototype could be used for the detection of both floating microplastics as well as microplastics experiencing sedimentation in natural water bodies, and in water filtration in water treatment plants.", "The adsorption, regeneration and engineering applications of biochar for removal organic pollutants: A review ": "In recent years, with the continuous development of industry and agriculture, the content of organic pollutants in the environment has been increasing, which has caused serious pollution to the environment. Adsorption has proven to be an effective and economically viable method of removing organic contaminants. Since biochar has many advantages such as various types of raw materials, low cost, and recyclability, it can achieve the effect of turning waste into treasure when used for environmental treatment. This paper summarizes the source and production of biochar, points out its research status in the removal of organic pollutants, expounds its adsorption mechanism on organic pollutants, introduces the relevant adsorption parameters, summarizes its regeneration methods, studies its application of engineering, and finally analyses of benefits and describes the development prospects.", "Principle and applications of microbubble and nanobubble technology for water treatment ": "In recent years, microbubble and nanobubble technologies have drawn great attention due to their wide applications in many fields of science and technology, such as water treatment, biomedical engineering, and nanomaterials. In this paper, we discuss the physics, methods of generation of microbubbles (MBs) and nanobubbles (NBs), while production of free radicals from MBs and NBs are reviewed with the focuses on degradation of toxic compounds, water disinfection, and cleaning/defouling of solid surfaces including membrane. Due to their ability to produce free radicals, it can be expected that the future prospects of MBs and NBs will be immense and yet more to be explored.", "Removal of natural organic matter in drinking water treatment by coagulation: A comprehensive review ": "Natural organic matter (NOM) is a complex matrix of organic substances produced in (or channeled to) aquatic ecosystems via various biological, geological and hydrological cycles. Such variability is posing a serious challenge to most water treatment technologies, especially the ones designed to treat drinking water supplies. Lately, in addition to the fluctuating composition of NOM, a substantial increase of its concentration in fresh waters, and also municipal wastewater effluents, has been reported worldwide, which justifies the urgent need to develop highly efficient and versatile water treatment processes.\n                  Coagulation is among the most applied processes for water and wastewater treatment. The application of coagulation to remove NOM from drinking water supplies has received a great deal of attention from researchers around the world because it was efficient and helped avoiding the formation of disinfection by products (DBPs). Nonetheless, with the increased fluctuation of NOM in water (concentration and composition), the efficiency of conventional coagulation was substantially reduced, hence the need to develop enhanced coagulation processes by optimizing the operating conditions (mainly the amount coagulants and pH), developing more efficient inorganic or organic coagulants, as well as coupling coagulation with other water treatment technologies. In the present review, recent research studies dealing with the application of coagulation for NOM removal from drinking water supplies are presented and compared. In addition, integration schemes combining coagulation and other water treatment processes are presented, including membrane filtration, oxidation, adsorption and others processes.", "Engineered/designer biochar for contaminant removal/immobilization from soil and water: Potential and implication of biochar modification ": "The use of biochar has been suggested as a means of remediating contaminated soil and water. The practical applications of conventional biochar for contaminant immobilization and removal however need further improvements. Hence, recent attention has focused on modification of biochar with novel structures and surface properties in order to improve its remediation efficacy and environmental benefits. Engineered/designer biochars are commonly used terms to indicate application-oriented, outcome-based biochar modification or synthesis. In recent years, biochar modifications involving various methods such as, acid treatment, base treatment, amination, surfactant modification, impregnation of mineral sorbents, steam activation and magnetic modification have been widely studied. This review summarizes and evaluates biochar modification methods, corresponding mechanisms, and their benefits for contaminant management in soil and water. Applicability and performance of modification methods depend on the type of contaminants (i.e., inorganic/organic, anionic/cationic, hydrophilic/hydrophobic, polar/non-polar), environmental conditions, remediation goals, and land use purpose. In general, modification to produce engineered/designer biochar is likely to enhance the sorption capacity of biochar and its potential applications for environmental remediation.", "Phosphorus flame retardants: Properties, production, environmental occurrence, toxicity and analysis ": "Since the ban on some brominated flame retardants (BFRs), phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs), which were responsible for 20% of the flame retardant (FR) consumption in 2006 in Europe, are often proposed as alternatives for BFRs. PFRs can be divided in three main groups, inorganic, organic and halogen containing PFRs. Most of the PFRs have a mechanism of action in the solid phase of burning materials (char formation), but some may also be active in the gas phase. Some PFRs are reactive FRs, which means they are chemically bound to a polymer, whereas others are additive and mixed into the polymer. The focus of this report is limited to the PFRs mentioned in the literature as potential substitutes for BFRs. The physico-chemical properties, applications and production volumes of PFRs are given. Non-halogenated PFRs are often used as plasticisers as well. Limited information is available on the occurrence of PFRs in the environment. For triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), tricresylphosphate (TCP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), tris(chloropropyl)phosphate (TCPP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP), and tetrekis(2-chlorethyl)dichloroisopentyldiphosphate (V6) a number of studies have been performed on their occurrence in air, water and sediment, but limited data were found on their occurrence in biota. Concentrations found for these PFRs in air were up to 47\u03bcgm\u22123, in sediment levels up to 24mgkg\u22121 were found, and in surface water concentrations up to 379ngL\u22121. In all these matrices TCPP was dominant. Concentrations found in dust were up to 67mgkg\u22121, with TDCPP being the dominant PFR. PFR concentrations reported were often higher than polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) concentrations, and the human exposure due to PFR concentrations in indoor air appears to be higher than exposure due to PBDE concentrations in indoor air.\n                  Only the Cl-containing PFRs are carcinogenic. Other negative human health effects were found for Cl-containing PFRs as well as for TCP, which suggest that those PFRs would not be suitable alternatives for BFRs. TPhP, diphenylcresylphosphate (DCP) and TCP would not be suitable alternatives either, because they are considered to be toxic to (aquatic) organisms. Diethylphosphinic acid is, just like TCEP, considered to be very persistent. From an environmental perspective, resorcinol-bis(diphenylphosphate) (RDP), bisphenol-A diphenyl phosphate (BADP) and melamine polyphosphate, may be suitable good substitutes for BFRs.\n                  Information on PFR analysis in air, water and sediment is limited to TCEP, TCPP, TPhP, TCP and some other organophosphate esters. For air sampling passive samplers have been used as well as solid phase extraction (SPE) membranes, SPE cartridges, and solid phase micro-extraction (SPME).\n                  For extraction of PFRs from water SPE is recommended, because this method gives good recoveries (67\u2013105%) and acceptable relative standard deviations (RSDs) (<20%), and offers the option of on-line coupling with a detection system. For the extraction of PFRs from sediment microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) is recommended. The recoveries (78\u2013105%) and RSDs (3\u20138%) are good and the method is faster and requires less solvent compared to other methods.\n                  For the final instrumental analysis of PFRs, gas chromatography\u2013flame photometric detection (GC\u2013FPD), GC-nitrogen\u2013phosphorus detection (NPD), GC\u2013atomic emission detection (AED), GC\u2013mass spectrometry (MS) as well as liquid chromatography (LC)\u2013MS/MS and GC\u2013Inductively-coupled plasma\u2013MS (ICP\u2013MS) are used. GC\u2013ICP\u2013MS is a promising method, because it provides much less complex chromatograms while offering the same recoveries and limits of detection (LOD) (instrumental LOD is 5\u201310ngmL\u22121) compared to GC\u2013NPD and GC\u2013MS, which are frequently used methods for PFR analysis. GC\u2013MS offers a higher selectivity than GC\u2013NPD and the possibility of using isotopically labeled compounds for quantification.", "Preliminary assessment of heavy metals in water and sediment of Karnaphuli River, Bangladesh ": "Contamination of heavy metals in sediment is regarded as a global crisis with a large share in developing countries like Bangladesh. Four heavy metals such as arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in sediments and water were investigated from Karnaphuli River in Bangladesh. The decreasing trend of metals were observed in water as Cr>As>Pb>Cd and in sediment Cr>Pb>As>Cd. The ranges of heavy metals in water were 13.31\u201353.87, 46.09\u2013112.43, 2.54\u201318.34 and 5.29\u201327.45\u03bcg/L and in sediments were 11.56\u201335.48, 37.23\u2013160.32, 0.63\u20133.56 and 21.98\u201373.42mg/kg for As, Cr, Cd and Pb. The level of studied metals in water samples exceeded the safe limits of drinking water, indicated that water from this river is not safe for drinking and/or cooking. Contamination factor (CF) confirmed that the sediment samples were moderate to high contamination by As, Cd and Pb. The pollution load index (PLI) values were above one (>1) indicates advanced decline of the sediment quality. This study recommended that continuous monitoring of As, Cd and Pb in water; sediment and other aquatic biota of Karnaphuli River should be directed to assess the risk of these vital metals to safe the ecology in the vicinity of this river.", "Photocatalytic degradation of low density polyethylene (LDPE) films using titania nanotubes ": "Polyethylene (PE) waste disposal is a major issue now a days that poses serious threats to human and environmental health. Among the methods of dealing with problem, photocatalytic degradation in the visible light is an alternative option that has received attention recently. The photo catalyst, generally used, is titania in the nanoparticle form. In the current study, complexity of employing a larger surface area nanomaterial in the form of titania nanotubes has been investigated. Prepared nanostructures were characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD, BET surface area measurements and UV-visible spectroscopy. Taking a lead from the work done for the development of dye sensitized solar cells, blue green dye was used to sensitize the TNTs with very encouraging results. The degradation of pure and composite PE films was measured in terms of photo-induced weight loss and was confirmed by FTIR, SEM, surface roughness and tensile strength testing. Thus, polyethylene films with 10% dye sensitized titania nanotubes showed a degradation of around 50% under visible light over a short period of 45 days.", "Synthesis and characterization of environmental friendly corncob biochar based nano-composite \u2013 A potential slow release nano-fertilizer for sustainable agriculture ": "Use of agriculture waste to develop value-added products has helped in resolving the waste management concernsalong with addressing the cost-effectiveness issues. Utilization of bio-char derived from agriculture waste back to the agriculture field marks the new strategy to improve crop yield and reduce environmental issues of conventional fertilizers. In addition to that it helps in improving soil condition by balancing the soil organic carbon, pH, water holding capacity and soil ion exchange potential. The present research work is based on the development of nano-composite based on biochar derived from corn cob and to check the suitability of corncob biochar(CB) as support material for providing macro and micro-nutrients to the plants on slow release basis.CBand its nano-composite (BNC) were synthesized by pyrolysis and simple impregnation method, respectively and characterized by FT-IR,SEM/EDX, powder XRD,AFMand TGA/DSC. Proximate analysis and physical properties were also examined by standard procedures whilestudies on water retention, water absorbance, swelling ratio and equilibrium water content of pointed to increased values of BNC as compared to CB. Slow release studies indicated release pattern of nutrients for prolonged period which is helpful in improving plant growth and yield. The experimental results indicated that the synthesized nano-composite is eco-friendly material and can be used as slow release fertilizer for sustainable agriculture.", "Assessment of heavy metals contamination in selected tropical marine fish species in Bangladesh and their impact on human health ": "\u2022\n                           Chemical pollution in marine ecosystems is leading towards an increase in the concentrations of heavy metals in fish body, which might have a negative impact on human health through consumption of fish. Here, five commercially important marine fishes (i.e. Sillaginopsis panijus, Trichiurus lepturus, Harpadon nehereus, Rita rita and Coilia dussumieri) were collected from the Kutubdia Channel of the northern Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. Samples were collected during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon for the year of 2016 to measure the heavy metal concentrations in edible part (flesh) of the fishes; and finally to assess the human health risk due to consumption of those fishes. Heavy metal concentrations (i.e. Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Sn and As) in the collected fish species were determined using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) method. Subsequently, for assessing the human health risk, the target hazard quotient (THQ) values were estimated. This study found that the heavy metal concentration for Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Sn and As in fish samples were 1.51 to 2.53, 2.14 to 5.08, 2.89 to 3.41, 14.54 to 18.45, 23.04 to 32.21 and < 0.41\u2009mg/kg respectively as dry weight basis. This study also revealed that the THQ values for all studied metals in five species of fishes for both seasons were < 1, which indicating no cancer risk due to consumption of those fishes. On the other hand, the target cancer risk for Pb was found within an acceptable level (10\u22124 to 10-6). Therefore, it has been suggested that the selected tropical marine fishes might be free from contamination and human might be in safe from any risk due to consumption of those fishes.", "Magnetic composite an environmental super adsorbent for dye sequestration \u2013 A review ": "Adsorption is the most extensively used technique for dye sequestration. Magnetic separation of toxic pollutant is becoming a potential method in waste water purification and found to have predominant significance in the removal of dyes more effectively compared to conventional method of treatments. Numerous natural and synthetic adsorbents were used, out of which magnetic composites (MCs) and magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) have gained much attention presently in the removal of dyes from aqueous solution. Abundant references are existing pertaining to synthesis of various magnetic composites and its application in adsorption of dyes. This report displays the exploitation of MCs and MNCs for adsorption of dyes, hazards posed by dyes, sorption mechanism, preparation methods, magnetic behavior and characteristics of magnetized particles with the relevant literature on the basic principle of adsorption using MCs and MNCs for separation of dyes under optimum physicochemical condition. Adsorption reaction model, diffusion model and isotherms which facilitate in understanding the reaction mechanism between adsorbent and adsorbate are concisely discussed.", "Amoxicillin degradation using green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles: Kinetics and mechanism analysis ": "Beta-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin (AMX) removal in aqueous solution using green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles (gINPs) from Carob pod (Ceratonia siliqua) was studied. The characterization analyses of the gINPs were performed by TEM, SEM, EDX, XRD, BET, FESEM and Raman spectroscopy. The nanoparticles were found as oxide forms with the spherical shape at an average of 7\u2009\u00b1\u20095 nm dimensions with 7.67 m2/g surface area. The experimental analysis revealed that the amoxicillin removal efficiency depends on the initial pH, AMX concentration, temperature, and gINPs dose. High removal efficiency (99%) was obtained at a molar ratio of 1:50 AMX/gINPs in 200 min at pH 2. The removal of amoxicillin was investigated by the kinetic studies for the adsorption and degradation mechanisms. The kinetic analysis showed that the adsorption is a physical process with an activation energy of 30 kJ.mol\u22121. The removal process was determined as the pseudo-first-order following a chemically surface-controlled reaction due to the high activation energy of 87\u2009kJ.mol\u22121. The occurrence of AMX degradation products was detected by UV\u2013vis and HPLC/MS analyses. The potential degradation pathway of AMX using gINPs was determined as physical adsorption onto the iron corrosion products, and then reduction on the surface of gINPs.", "Emerging contaminants: Here today, there tomorrow! ": "The subject of emerging contaminants has attracted wide attention from researchers and society world over due to their emerging as well as potential adverse impacts on the environment. Many attempts have been made to shed light on the importance of the release of these contaminants into various environments and further urge policymakers to take required measures. Nevertheless, the effective long-term strategy for addressing this issue is latent in the modification of current technologies of wastewater/water treatment plants and integrating them into a holistic and circular water management system. The research on the new technologies of water treatment must be realigned to consider the real conditions and meet certain requirements set according to technical and environmental perspectives.", "Organophosphorus pesticides residues in food and their colorimetric detection ": "Pesticides are enormously used to control the pests in agriculture, industry and human premises. Agricultural production has been significantly increased with the help of pesticides but their uncontrolled and excessive use is polluting the environment, food, water and agricultural products. Presence of pesticides residues in food products and human milk is the alarming sign to set up stringent monitoring system and eradication remedies. Many advancements have been happened in recent years for the detection and quantification different pesticides in the various matrices. The present review article specifically focuses on the detection techniques for the organophosphorus pesticides. Organophosphorus pesticides are now a days hugely applied in agriculture after ban on many organochlorine pesticides and hence creating health complications. Visual or colorimetric detection of the pesticides using different nanostructures is considerably exploited for the onsite monitoring of organophosphorus pesticides. These advancements in pesticides detection are presented in detail along with brief overview of pesticides removal methodologies.", "Monitoring of engineered nanoparticles in soil-plant system: A review ": "Soil and water are the ultimate natural sink for the engineered nanoparticles (ENPs). One of the most significant factors which control the mobility and stability of colloidal suspension in soil along with the absorption, aggregation, and deposition depends on the surface properties of particular ENPs. The size and shape of the ENPs ultimately determine the degree of toxicology. Therefore, monitoring of nanoparticles in soil plant system is not merely essential, but more information is needed on their size allocation and physical properties. Various techniques have been found to be pertinent for ENPs characterization in toxicological and ecotoxicological studies. Information generated from these studies can be helpful in exact risk assessment which can then only be synchronized or used in standard testing. However, there exists a fair amount of demand for development of the newer and sophisticated technologies that can allow simultaneous determination of physical as well as chemical properties of nanoparticles present in the soil and plant samples. In this review, we have highlighted existing as well as promising developments in the area of ENPs detection and quantifications in soil-plant system. Further improvements in the analytical tools will be beneficial to understand the fate and transport of ENPs in soil plant system and nurture awareness of nanoparticle toxicology, their associated benefits and interrelated issues.", "Treatment of olive mill based wastewater by means of magnetic nanoparticles: Decolourization, dephenolization and COD removal ": "Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is an environmental concern that has been highlighted as a serious environmental problem in the Mediterranean basin countries because of its high organic load and phytotoxic and antibacterial phenolic compounds, which resist biological degradation. Consequently, this type of wastewater represents a huge challenge for the conventional wastewater treatment techniques as it can impact the lifetime of bacteria needed for the treatment. Iron-oxide nanoparticles are attractive for wastewater treatment for two important reasons. First, nanoparticles can remove pollutants from wastewater rapidly. Second, this magnetic type of nanoparticles could be separated easily using a magnet after finishing treatment process. In this study, we aimed at investigating the effectiveness of the magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the removal of large organic contaminants from OMW. Batch and continuous mode processes were applied on OMW treatment to determine the effect of contact time, solution pH, coexisting contaminants and the adsorption isotherm.\n                  The results showed that the adsorption was fast and the adsorption reached equilibrium within less than 30min. The adsorption equilibrium data fit very well to the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) Model, indicating multi-layers adsorption. The adsorption of major pollutants was associated to an efficient removal of coexisting contaminants such as heavy metals and free ions. The adsorption of OMW pollutants was dependent on pH of the solution. Finally, continuous-mode process was tested successfully using a packed bed column that combined sand filtration with magnetic nanoparticles to decolourize OMW effluent. This study will provide valuable insight on the effect of nanoparticles toward the treatment and recyclability of olive mill wastewater, which is crucial for the local olive mill industry. After seeing the successful achievement of integrating nanoparticles with fixed bed filtration, a preliminary process description and cost estimation of stand-alone plant (with a capacity of 4m3/h) for OMW treatment were considered in this study. Process capital and annual operating costs were estimated to be $12,306 and $476/year, respectively.", "Accumulation of organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticide residues in fish, water, and sediments in the Thamirabarani river system of southern peninsular India ": "This study was undertaken to investigate the bioaccumulation of organochlorine (OCPs) and pyrethroids pesticides in surface water, sediments, fish, and aquatic weeds of the Thamirabarani river system, southern India. Samples were collected from five sampling sites, viz, Manimuthar, Tirunelveli, Srivaikuntam, Authoor, and Punnakayal, and tested for OCPs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) following QuEChERS extraction procedure. OCPs detected in surface waters ranged from 0.001 to 34.44\u2009\u03bcgl\u22121; sediments from 0.01 to 16.72\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121; fish muscle from 0.01 to 26.05\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121; gills from 0.01 to 40.56\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121; liver from 0.01 to 65.14\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121 and aquatic weeds from 0.01 to 5.53\u2009\u03bcg kg\u22121. Endosulfan, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin and heptachlor were the dominant OCPs found above the maximum residue limits set by World Health Organisation for surface waters. Sediments also contained relatively high amounts of endosulfan, aldrin, dieldrin, and endrin. Species - specific bioaccumulation of OCPs in fish muscle tissue was noticed. Rohu contained more endosulfan than catla and tilapia. Concentration of OCPs in the liver was much higher than that in the gills and muscles. Methoxychlor was one of the predominant OCPs in the fish liver. A positive correlation existed between fat content and bioaccumulation of OCPs in fish muscle. Aquatic weeds in the river did not have significant levels of OCPs. Presence of relatively high levels of OCPs in upstream waters is therefore a serious concern and hence suitable measures need to be taken up by regulatory authorities.", "Leachate characterizations and pollution indices of active and closed unlined landfills in Malaysia ": "Leachate is one of the most serious environmental hazards associated with landfills especially which are unlined and uncontrolled. Thus, this study aims to characterize and compare raw leachate from active landfills (Ulu Maasop and Kampung Keru) and closed landfill (Pajam), then subsequently quantify the potential leachate contamination from each landfill using Leachate Pollution Index (LPI). The results obtained from the current study were compared with data from previous publications and indicated higher physico-chemical characterizations, especially for BOD and COD, than that of the other similar landfill categories. Based on the current findings, the low ratio of biodegradability and slightly alkaline pH values in leachate samples indicated that the sites (both active and closed landfills) were characterized by methanogenic conditions. Moreover, heavy metal concentrations, Cr, Fe and Se levels were higher than the leachate discharge standards for all leachate sampling sites. The As, Cu, and Mn, also surpassed the leachate discharge standards for the active landfill sites tested in this study (Ulu Maasop and Kampung Keru landfills). Next, the LPI calculated for Ulu Maasop, Kampung Keru, Pajam (1 and 2) landfills were 15.28, 13.89, 12.91 and 11.51, respectively, all exceeding the LPI for discharge standard of 5.696. Based on the leachate characterizations and the LPI values, these landfills pose a significant threat to the environment through the dissipation of leachate to the surface and groundwater, especially with the presence of BOD, COD, As and Cr. Thus, remedial actions such as rehabilitation of such unlined landfills and post-closure monitoring are crucial for both active and closed landfills to ensure the generated leachate is stabilized. Such actions will reduce and control the threat to the environment.", "Heavy metal contamination and health risk assessment associated with abandoned barite mines in Cross River State, southeastern Nigeria ": "In the present investigation, the concentration of heavy metals (As, Ba, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) in pond and stream water samples near abandoned barite mines have been studied. The main objective of study was to appraise the degree of contamination and human risk assessment due to barite mining. Results showed that the average concentrations of Fe, Hg and Pb were above the required standard. This indicates anthropogenic inputs from barite mining activities. The mean concentrations of Ba, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were higher in pond water compared to stream water. Contamination index and Nemerow pollution index indicated contamination at some mine sites, while human health risk assessment indicated unacceptable risk (hazard index (HI) values>1) for non-carcinogenic adverse health effect. The cancer risk of being exposed to Arsenic by drinking water from these sources did not exceed the acceptable risk of 1:10,000 for regulatory purposes.", "Disposable screen printed graphite electrode for the direct electrochemical determination of ibuprofen in surface water ": "The potential of square wave voltammetry (SWV) for the determination of ibuprofen in aqueous solution, applying baseline correction, is reported. A screen printed graphite electrodes (SPGEs), especially pretreated for this purpose, were used to investigate the electrochemical oxidation and detection of ibuprofen. After optimization of SWV parameters, measurements were carried out at 200Hz modulation frequency, 4mV step potential and 40mV pulse amplitude for the determination of ibuprofen. The surfaces of both untreated and pretreated SPGEs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electro-catalytic properties of both the electrodes were correlated with the surface treatment. The pretreated screen printed graphite electrode exhibited a high sensitivity toward ibuprofen even in low concentration. The developed method was found rapid, cost-effective and reproducible for in-field ibuprofen detection.", "Effects of zinc-oxide nanoparticles on soil, plants, animals and soil organisms: A review ": "Zinc-oxide nanoparticles are being used in a wide range of commercial applications and are therefore expected to find their way into the soil ecosystem. Problems concerning Zinc-oxide nanoparticle toxicity, in-vitro and in-vivo testing methods for living organisms, the development of environmental health criteria and the acceptance of toxicity limits of metal nanoparticles, are topical. This review will contribute to understanding the fate and behaviour of Zinc-oxide nanoparticles in soil, their uptake and distribution within plants, animals, and microbes as well as their interactions with other pollutants. It is an essential prerequisite to environmentally realistic studies of the ecotoxicology of nanoparticles. Increased application of nanoparticles threatens communities as well as plants, terrestrial and aquatic animals. Thus, it is important to explore whether nanoparticles could compromise soil biodiversity and the important functions maintained by soil communities.", "Ecotoxicological status and risk assessment of heavy metals in municipal solid wastes dumpsite impacted soil in Nigeria ": "Standard analytical protocols and pollution indices were used to evaluate eco-toxicological status and health risks of heavy metals contamination in municipal solid waste (MSW) impacted soil in Uyo, Nigeria. Heavy metals concentrations of soil were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES). The analysis shows ranges of extractable concentration of heavy metals in impacted soil samples during the wet season were Ni, 0.92\u20131.4\u2009mg/kg; Zn, 35.9\u201347.5\u2009mg/kg; Pb, 1.8\u20133.7\u2009mg/kg; Cr, 0.78\u20130.89\u2009mg/kg; Cd, 0.79\u20130.98\u2009mg/kg; As, 0.09\u20130.17\u2009mg/kg and Fe, 1108\u20131534\u2009mg/kg, while Ni, 0.124\u20131.4\u2009mg/kg; Zn, 7.22\u201327.5\u2009mg/kg; Pb, 1.72\u20132.98\u2009mg/kg; Cr, 0.066\u20130.389\u2009mg/kg, Cd, 0.94\u20134.12\u2009mg/kg; As, 0.018\u20130.1046\u2009mg/kg and Fe, 988.2\u20131411\u2009mg/kg were recorded during the dry season. Cumulative lifetime risks associated with exposures to potentially toxic metals through dermal, oral ingestion, and inhalation routes were evaluated for public health information and management. However, heavy metals contamination with potential carcinogenic risks to preteens was established. The risks however varied with the type of metal, level of contamination, season, and age. The analysis revealed very high carcinogenic lifetime risk among preteens through oral ingestion with cumulative risk mean value of 5.71E-03. Incremental lifetime cancer rate (ILCR) range of 1.00\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u20131.00\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 was obtained and cumulative risks associated with oral ingestion of metallic toxicants was higher during the wet season. The cumulative mean values recorded were 6.92 E-03, 2.73 E-03 and 9.39 E-04 for preteens, children and adults, respectively. The health risks associated with farming within dumpsite environ are high and should be prohibited.", "Treatment of winery wastewater with aerated cells mobile system ": "Winery wastewater poses a serious environmental problem, especially for small wineries whose yearly wastewater production and/or financial resources may not be sufficient to warrant advanced treatment plants. We constructed an integrated mobile system comprised of a coago-flocculation module using nanocomposites to reduce TSS, and two series of aerated cells to reduce COD, N, polyphenols, and P concentrations so effluents could be discharged into a municipal wastewater treatment plant or under special conditions, recycled for irrigation. Each series consists of four portable containers (1.5m3) filled with volcanic tuff of a decreasing progressive particle-size structure and equipped with a forced-air apparatus to keep a minimum soluble oxygen level of 1.5mgL\u22121. The key feature of the aerated cells is constant air transfer through the substrate which greatly increases treatment capacity. The entire system was mounted on two flat lorry beds equipped with a special hook for easy transportation. We tested the system during two consecutive vintage seasons in 2013 and 2014. The nanocomposite module reduced the TSS by more than 95% while the aerated cells decreased the COD concentration to less than 700mgL\u22121 at the discharge point (90\u201395% removal efficiency), which meets the stringent requirement for release to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. TP concentrations were reduced from a mean of 42mgL\u22121 in the first cells to 2.2mgL\u22121 in the outlet of the system with an overall reduction efficiency of 95%. The maximum COD loading rate was 8.66kgm3 d\u22121, a remarkably high rate considering the minimal operating area. The aerated cells are susceptible to clogging, but we solved this problem with a \u2018hoist-sack solution\u2019 and/or treatment with a H2O2 solution that can be implemented easily without majorly impeding normal operation.", "Geochemical speciation, anthropogenic contamination, risk assessment and source identification of selected metals in freshwater sediments\u2014A case study from Mangla Lake, Pakistan ": "Geochemical speciation of selected metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn) using modified BCR sequential extraction procedure was performed in the sediments collected from Mangla Lake, Pakistan. The extraction method was optimized using certified reference material (BCR-701) which showed significant recoveries (95\u2013106%). Among the metals, Cd, Co, Ni, Pb and Sr exhibited relatively higher mobility and bioavailability, while Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were found mainly in the residual fractions. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed four groups of the metals in the sediments; I (Cd\u2013Cr\u2013Ni\u2013Sr), II (Co\u2013Pb), III (Fe\u2013Zn), and IV (Mn\u2013Cu); first two groups were mostly contributed by anthropogenic sources. The pollution indicators (individual contamination factor, enrichment factor and geoaccumulation index) revealed significant anthropogenic contamination of Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn in the sediments. Risk assessment code (RAC) indicated medium risk for Co and Ni; high risk for Cd and Pb; and very high risk for Sr in the sediments. Cluster analysis (CA) and global contamination factor (GCF) were used to identify the pollution hotspots, which indicated more severe metal contamination at sites near to Mirpur city and other urban/semi-urban areas (S3\u2013S5), especially for Cd, Co, Ni, Pb and Sr.", "Synthesis and characterization of antibiotic-metal complexes [FeCl3(L1)2H2O and Ni(NO3)2(L2)2H2O] and enhanced antibacterial activity ": "Antibacterial drugs can become more efficient against bacteria on coordination with transition metals. In this context, the current study focused on the synthesis and characterization of antibiotic metal complexes and in vitro evaluation of their antibacterial efficacy. The complex 1, FeCl3(L1)2H2O (Penicillin G and Iron) and complex 2, Ni(NO3)2(L2)2H2O (Ciprofloxacin and nickel) were synthesized via refluxing reaction and characterized by FTIR, TG/DTA, DLS, Powder XRD, FESEM, and Elemental analysis. Both the complexes were found to be biologically active with enhanced efficacy. Activities were measured by the zone of inhibition, minimal inhibitory concentration and growth pattern of bacteria. Serratia sp. R1, Serratia sp. W1 and Staphylococcus sp.Y1 were found to be sensitive against both, the complex 1 and complex 2 while Bacillus sp. K1 showed minor activity. Antibiotic-metal complex showed enhanced activity. Hence, a combination of antibiotics with metal salts may be an efficient and better option and might prove to be an alternative treatment against the resistant bacteria.", "Response surface optimization of hydrothermal synthesis of Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles under supercritical water conditions: Application for photocatalytic degradation of Tetracycline ": "Ultrafine bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) powders have been successfully synthesized through supercritical water hydrothermal technique, in a batch type reactor. A Box\u2013Behnken three-level experimental design was used to optimize the process variables affecting the BiFeO3 efficiency includes pH of starting solution (1.5\u201312.5), reaction time (1\u20132\u2009h), and reaction temperature (450\u2013550 \u2103). The samples were characterized via X\u2013ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The model was validated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and conducting an experiment at optimal design conditions (temperature of 522 \u2103, pH of 3.25 and 1.3\u2009h). The maximum BiFeO3 production efficiency which obtained at optimum condition was about 45%. The attained results showed good correlation between the predicted model and experimental data (Model P-Value\u2009=\u20090.0052). The present work confirmed that the supercritical water hydrothermal method is a suitable way to produce BiFeO3 nanoparticles with a mean grain size of 60\u2009nm and narrow size distribution. Moreover, the optical property of the product was investigated by Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The attained nanostructures showed a narrow band gap of 1.96\u2009eV, indicating that BiFeO3 powders can be applied as a novel visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for degradation of tetracycline (TC). Photocatalytic experiments revealed that using BiFeO3 nanoparticles, TC degradation efficiency of 80.3% and 87.5% could be reached under UV and visible light radiations, respectively. Furthermore, it was found the degradation of TC follows the pseudo-second-order kinetics by BiFeO3.", "Fabrication of polyacrylonitrile/\u03b2-cyclodextrin/graphene oxide nanofibers composite as an efficient adsorbent for cationic dye ": "This research reported fabrication of hybrid Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/ \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD)/graphene oxide (GO) composite nanofibers materials using the electrospinning technique. The PAN/\u03b2-CD/GO nanofibers were electrospun using a different concentrations of GO (1.0\u20135.0 %) depend of the total weight of PAN/\u03b2-CD. Subsequently, the PAN/\u03b2-CD/GO nanofibers were characterized by SEM, an optical microscope (OM), XRD, FTIR, TGA, and Raman. Results indicated that various properties of nanofibers were modified upon the addition of different concentrations of GO. The resulted hybrid nanofibers were employed as a membrane for dye removal from aqueous media. The adsorption activity of PAN/\u03b2-CD/GO composite nanofibers at different GO concentrations was examined by using crystal violet (CV) as model dye molecules. Results obtained demonstrated that the adsorption process was affected by the concentration of the GO. In addition, the equilibrium and adsorption kinetic behaviors of dye sorption onto the nanofibers were found to conform to a pseudo-second-order kinetics.", "Diversity and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella \n               enterica isolated from fresh produce and environmental samples ": "In Nigeria, as in most developing countries, vegetable farmers depend largely on wastewater for irrigation and on untreated manure for soil enrichment. Salmonella is among the most important foodborne pathogens worldwide with fresh vegetables as major route of transmission to man. A total of 440 samples comprising vegetables and environmental samples (irrigation water and manure treated soil) were analyzed for the presence of Salmonella, resistance and virulence genes and diversity of isolates by genotyping. Samples were obtained from five irrigation fields in Kano and Plateau States and cultured using selective isolation with prior enrichment method. Presumptive isolates were identified and characterized using conventional biochemical methods and Microbact 24E (Oxoid, UK) identification kit. Amplification of virulence (invasive A and enterotoxin) genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) further confirmed Salmonella and its virulence potential. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic concensus (ERIC) fingerprinting PCR showed genetic diversity of confirmed isolates. Confirmed isolates were evaluated for susceptibilities to eight commonly used antimicrobial agents. Sixty-one (13.9%) samples were positive for Salmonella. The distribution of serotypes included; Salmonella typhi (7.7%), Salmonella paratyphi (2.0%) and Salmonella typhimurium (4.1%). S. typhi had the highest isolation rate and was most commonly detected in vegetables. Simultaneous resistance to all antibiotics assayed was found amongst the salmonellae. Fingerprinting pattern of the Salmonella strains from the different samples showed marked similarities and close genetic relatedness. Cluster analysis at a coefficient of similarity of 0.82 grouped the fifteen strains of Salmonella assayed into five different groups. Our results indicate that irrigated vegetables are vehicles of transmission of potentially pathogenic Salmonella isolates that can contribute to the development of salmonellosis and other Salmonella related infections in Nigeria. This study provides data that support the potential transmission strains of Salmonella harboring virulence and resistance factors from vegetables and environmental sources to cause infections in humans.", "A preliminary study of acid volcanic rocks for stonemeal application ": "This study is related to the chemical and mineralogical characterizations and to the availability of mineral nutrients in four fresh samples of fine material generated in crushing mills of volcanic rocks of the Serra Geral Formation in northeastern state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. The objective of the study is to estimate the agronomic potential of rocks, after pulverization, to its application as a fertilizer for the soil by means of the incorporation of rock, using a technique known as stonemeal. The analytical techniques were used: X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-MS), and leaching tests by extraction with citric acid solution diluted to 2%. The results indicated the potential of providing nutrients to the soil, corroborating the results of other studies based on the technique stonemeal. The following characteristics were identified in the samples: presence of calcium and magnesium as carbonates; high alkalinity; good availability of phosphorus; potassium average availability; and of the presence of micronutrients such as zinc, boron, copper, iron, and manganese.", "A new synthesis of Cu2O spherical particles for the degradation of methylene blue dye ": "In this paper, cuprous oxide nanoparticles (Cu2ONPs) were synthesized using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent and Origanum vulgare leaf extract as an oxidizing agent. The experimental reaction was conducted at room temperature. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Cu2ONPs was evaluated in the presence of methylene blue (MB) dye. The nanoparticles were characterized using Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The UV\u2013vis spectra exhibit surface plasm\u00f3n resonance bands that confirm the presence of Cu2ONPs. The XRD reflections of the obtained solids were indexed according to the cubic structure of Cu2O. SEM and TEM analysis reveal particles with a spherical morphology ranging in size from 60 to 120\u2009nm with an average size of 90\u2009nm. The experimental results showed that the Cu2ONPs are a useful material for the degradation of MB dye after 80\u2009min in the absence of any catalyzer (i.e.NaBH4) during reaction.", "Toxicity of PVA-stabilized silver nanoparticles to algae and microcrustaceans ": "Over the years there has been a significant increase in the manufacturing of silver nanoparticles-based products, mainly due to their antimicrobial activity, with application in medicine and textile and food industry. However, the inappropriate use and disposal of these materials can allow the entry of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) into the aquatic environment, with potential toxicological effects. In this study we used Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Artemia salina and Daphnia similis as model organisms to investigate the toxicity of PVA-stabilized AgNP at several concentration levels. AgNP were physico-chemically characterized by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy, particle size distribution, zeta potential analyzes and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). AgNP presented a maximum absorption at 400nm and size range between 2 and 18nm. Each specific organism was exposed to AgNP concentrations through standardized protocol. For P. subcapitata and A. salina the EC50 value found, 1.09mgL\u22121 and 5.5\u00d710\u22122\n                     mg/L, respectively, were in accordance to previous results reported in the literature. However, for D. similis, the EC50 24\u201348h values indicate a higher toxicity than other results reported for other daphnids.", "The role of English in scientific communication: lingua franca or Tyrannosaurus rex?\n             ": "The use of English as an international language of science (EILS) is by now well documented; depending on one\u2019s orientation, English may be seen as a neutral lingua franca or it may be seen more insidiously as a dominating and overpowering force. This paper explores these co-existing roles of EILS through various perspectives. It begins by outlining conversations regarding EILS found in the literature of applied linguistics and the scientific community. The paper then turns to the perspective of international graduate students studying at an American university through a small-scale questionnaire and focus group interview study that attempts to understand these students\u2019 attitudes toward English and its role in scientific communication. Findings from the study are discussed in light of published conversations of EILS and implications for an EAP classroom that aims to recognize the dual roles of English in scientific communication.", "\u2018Argument!\u2019 helping students understand what essay writing is about ": "Argumentation is a key requirement of the essay, which is the most common genre that students have to write. However, how argumentation is realised in disciplinary writing is often poorly understood by academic tutors, and therefore not adequately taught to students. This paper presents research into undergraduate students\u2019 concepts of argument when they arrive at university, difficulties they experience with developing arguments in their essays, and the type and quality of instruction they receive. A three-part definition which describes argumentation by what students need to learn was used as the framework for analysis. The findings show that students have only partial or incorrect concepts of argument. Many problems they encounter are caused by their lack of knowledge of what an argumentative essay requires, particularly of the need to develop their own position in an academic debate. The advice they receive does not make the requirements explicit and refers to argumentation inconsistently and vaguely. An \u2018essay writing framework\u2019, based on the three-part definition, is proposed for improving the teaching of writing. This approach puts argumentation at the centre of instruction and explains other aspects of writing according to the function they have in the development of argument.", "The contribution of Halliday to EAP writing instruction: A personal journey ": "Halliday's work on the texture of texts and thematic structure is fundamental in enabling EAP students to follow the advice often given by lecturers to \u2018write clearly and logically\u2019. An understanding of thematic structure can equip students with the tools to construct paragraphs that communicate their own ideas in ways that are easy to read. This approach takes students beyond topic sentences and discourse markers to a more nuanced presentation of their arguments. In this researching EAP practice paper, I will trace the coverage of Theme and thematic structure in the research literature, in handbooks for teachers and in coursebooks for students, which influenced my own use of these concepts. I will show how these concepts were incorporated into teaching materials to help EAP students write effective paragraphs.", "An exploratory study on factors influencing undergraduate students\u2019 academic writing practices in Turkey ": "In EAP contexts, attaining a desired level of competence and fluency in academic writing is important for students majoring in English-medium undergraduate programs because their academic achievements are determined by the texts they produce in English. Undergraduate students in Turkey are observed to experience difficulties with academic writing as they try to accommodate their existing writing knowledge to the requirements of the new discipline-specific writing and learning situation of tertiary level education. Placing the students at the core of inquiry, the study explored factors influencing students' academic writing practices in English. The participants of the study were nineteen English major undergraduate students studying in Istanbul. The main data were obtained from background questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and were qualitatively analysed. The findings revealed that undergraduate writing is influenced by an array of interrelating educational and contextual factors: (1) the amount and nature of L1 and L2 pre-university writing instruction and experience, (2) students\u2019 perceptions about academic writing and disciplinary-specific text genres, (3) prolonged engagement with the academic context and discourse, and (4) expectations of faculty members. The insights gained from the study provide important implications for reconceptualization of writing instruction in Turkey.", "Metadiscourse in the introductions of PhD theses and research articles ": "Previous studies have indicated that the introductions of PhD theses and research articles are similar in their rhetorical features. In contrast, it has been suggested that metadiscourse as a rhetorical device is constructed in a different manner in these texts. However, very few studies have sought to empirically validate this assumption. This paper investigates how research writers construct metadiscourse in the introductions of their PhD theses and subsequently published research articles. The analysis shows that the majority of the writers make greater use of metadiscourse in their article introductions. The most significant changes include greater use of phrases referring to previous research, less reference to other parts of the text, and still less use of phrases signalling authorial presence. Close examination reveals that these variations derive from genre-specific features, including that writers of PhD thesis introductions present previews of the subsequent chapters. This paper closes by arguing that the variations can also be ascribed to the nature of the PhD thesis as an educational genre and that of research articles as a professional genre in which writers need to survive severe competition to get their manuscripts published.", "I am what I have written: A case study of identity construction in and through personal statement writing ": "The case study attempts to explore identity construction by examining a Chinese college student's personal statement writing. Based on Ivanic's framework of writer identity construction, an analysis of similarities and differences was made on the student's personal statements written for four different programs over a three-year period. It is found that the student constructed the desired writer identity of a qualified and special applicant who would fit into the target program mainly by making three discoursal choices for different self-representations, namely, narrating life experiences, referring to oneself and others, and highlighting. The interview results indicate that personal statement writing helped the student perceive her self and identity, both retrospectively and prospectively. It offers a significant implication for academic writing teaching and research. It is hoped that this case study can stimulate further research of identity construction in and through the personal statement as an occluded academic genre.", "EL1 and EL2 doctoral students\u2019 experience in writing the discussion section: A needs analysis ": "This article reports on a micro-level needs analysis of thesis discussion writing. An anonymised digital survey collected information from 295 doctoral candidates about their self-defined learning needs for thesis discussion writing. Participant variables include English language background (English First Language (EL1) speakers and English as an Additional or Second Language (EL2) speakers), discipline (Hard pure & Soft pure, Engineering, and Education), writing stage (early, mid, and final), and type of research methods (experiments, case studies, simulations, etc.). Findings reveal significant differences in students' perceptions of challenges and the genre conventions along these factors. The analysis also shows students\u2019 high expectations for the specificity and depth of support that they would like. Theoretically, the findings add to what is known about the challenges in EL1 and EL2 doctoral discussion writing. Pedagogically, they offer insights for supervisors and future students. We conclude the paper with some implications for future study into the teaching of thesis writing and doctoral supervision.", "Genre, discipline and identity ": "In Genre Analysis Swales encouraged us to see genres in terms of the communities in which they are used and as a function of the choices and constraints acting on text producers. It is this sensitivity to community practices which make genre a rich source of insights into two key concepts of the social sciences \u2013 community and identity. In this paper I take up these themes to explore the relationships between community expectations and the individual writer. To do so I use a corpus approach to recover evidence for repeated patterns of language which encode disciplinary preferences for different points of view, argument styles, attitudes to knowledge, and relationships between individuals and between individuals and ideas. The paper attempts to show how genre can offer insights into the ways actors understand both the here-and now interaction (the context of situation) and the broader constraints of the wider community which influence that interaction (the context of culture), revealing something of actors' orientations to scholarly communities and the ways they stake out individual positions.", "Students' writing from sources for academic purposes: A synthesis of recent research ": "Educators have long recognized that a major challenge for students learning to write for academic purposes is developing the ability to integrate source material effectively and appropriately into written compositions. To identify and evaluate the current state of empirical evidence, we conducted a systematic synthesis of the published research that has investigated writing from sources systematically from a variety of analytic perspectives, in first and second languages, and in diverse contexts internationally including students in universities, colleges, and secondary schools. Five general claims emerged across our analyses of 69 empirical studies published in refereed journals or books in English from 1993 to 2013. Each claim has firm empirical support but each also warrants further research and refinement: (1) students experience difficulties with, but develop certain strategies to deal with, the complex processes of writing from sources; (2) prior knowledge and experience influence students' performance in writing from sources; (3) differences may appear between L1 and L2 students in their understanding and uses of sources in writing; (4) performance in tasks that involve writing from sources varies by task conditions and types of texts written and read; and (5) instruction can help students improve their uses of sources in their writing.", "The use of humour in teaching and learning in higher education classrooms: Lecturers\u2019 perspectives ": "University lecturers' perspectives on the use of humour in teaching and learning have received little attention in the humour and higher education literature. Humour serves many roles in teaching and learning, and university lecturers' use of humour is both strategic and pedagogical in facilitating teaching. This paper explores the different types of humour that lecturers use in relation to three dominant theories of humour: the superiority, incongruity and relief theories. Intended and spontaneous humour and the various types of humour utilised to facilitate teaching and learning in the classroom are emphasised. Data for this study were collected by observing the classroom teaching of five award-winning lecturers in a university in New Zealand, who were identified and nominated by students as having a good sense of humour in the classroom. These lecturers were observed while teaching and then interviewed using Stimulated Recall Interviews (SRI) to understand their reflections-in-action concerning specific humorous moments and specific humorous behaviours while teaching. The data indicates that seven types of humour were used, either intentionally or spontaneously, to enhance student learning or to engage students' attention. These insights provide a fresh viewpoint on the use of humour from lecturers\u2019 perspectives.", "Writer background and voice construction in L2 writing ": "In the field of second language writing, some scholars argue that the concept of authorial voice is too culturally loaded to be accessible to L2 students, especially those from collectively-oriented cultures. Others, however, provide evidence, although not yet conclusive, showing that writers' cultural background may not affect their ability to construct an authorial voice. Given such conflicting arguments, and also in response to Tardy's (2012) call for research on the impact of extra-textual writer identity on voice construction, this study empirically examined the extent to which key writer background variables, such as age, gender, cultural background, and level of exposure to the target language and culture, may influence L2 writers' voice construction. Two hundred argumentative essays from L2 writers of various backgrounds were analyzed in terms of overall voice salience and use of individual voice elements. Correlational and regression analysis results showed that, overall, these variables had very limited, if any, impact on L2 writers' textual voice construction. The observed lack of strong association between voice salience and cultural background corroborates and supplements findings from previous research with a more qualitative approach, thus calling for a more cautious interpretation of the role of culture in voice development and L2 writing.", "\n               With the rapid development: A contrastive analysis of lexical bundles in dissertation abstracts by Chinese and L1 English doctoral students ": "This study compared the use of lexical bundles in dissertation abstracts written in English by Chinese and L1 English doctoral students. Our data consisted of 13,596 and 4,755 abstracts of doctoral dissertations written by Chinese students at Tsinghua University (the Tsinghua Corpus) and L1 English students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (the MIT Corpus), respectively. With a combination of frequency and dispersion criteria, 165 and 134 four-word bundles were identified from the Tsinghua Corpus and the MIT Corpus, respectively. These bundles were categorized structurally and functionally. Results revealed substantial differences in the frequencies with which bundles of different structural and functional categories were used by Chinese and L1 English students, as well as in the specific types of bundles of different categories they used. A close analysis of these differences revealed that Chinese students exhibited incomplete knowledge of some aspects of the English lexico-grammatical system, signs of transfer of Chinese language features and discourse conventions, and insufficient awareness of bundles characteristic of hard science disciplines.", "\u2018Can you talk me through your argument\u2019? Features of dialogic interaction in academic writing tutorials ": "Academic writing tutorials are regarded as beneficial when they are conducted in an egalitarian and dialogic mode of interaction, enabling students to negotiate and explore ideas. However, previous research has revealed a tendency towards tutor dominance and prescriptive, monologic teaching behaviour. The research presented in this article explored the nature of interaction and instructional talk in tutorials delivered by peer tutors. The peer-tutoring model is often chosen to facilitate discipline-specific advice; however, peer tutors may not always be sufficiently experienced and trained to deliver dialogic teaching. This study examined ten peer-led tutorials with the aim to make evidence-based recommendations for tutor training. The initial quantitative analysis led to the identification of the two most dialogic and the two most monologic tutorials, which were subsequently subjected to a detailed discourse analysis. The findings show an overall high degree of tutor-dominated interaction. In the few dialogic tutorials, however, the tutors' skilful use of initiating and follow-up moves and frequent use of scaffolding techniques helped the students to engage more deeply with their topic and solve problems independently . The findings suggest that tutor training should focus more explicitly on the benefits, features and strategies of a dialogic tutoring approach.", "The development of cognitive academic language proficiency in multilingual education: Evidence of a longitudinal study on the language of history ": "", "Do native writers always have a head start over nonnative writers? The use of lexical bundles in college students\u2019 essays ": "Formulaic language is widely used in academic prose and is known to be a useful measure of various aspects of language development. Prior studies have reported that L2 novice/student writers rely on formulaic language typical of conversation more than L1 academic writers do. However, these studies compared different types of academic writing, and thus do not clarify whether the L2 patterns they found are attributable to register or to characteristics of L2 writers, or both. The present study addresses this gap by examining the use of frequently recurring word sequences (lexical bundles) with comparable corpora of L1 and L2 novice academic writing, strictly matched for register and writing prompts. The study identified lexical bundles in the corpora, and analyzed these bundles\u2019 structures and functions. The findings suggest that the two groups display many common features in the use of bundles, including heavy use of VP-based bundles, stance-expression bundles, idiomatic PP bundles, and informal quantifying bundles, all of which have been described in previous work as unique features of learner LB use. The findings are informative regarding the extent to which native and nonnative students enter college equipped with knowledge of formulaic language appropriate to academic writing.", "Authorial voice constructed in citation in literature reviews of doctoral theses: Variations across training contexts ": "Constructing authorial voice is considered essential in English academic texts. Citation as an important discursive feature contributing to authorial voice has been underexplored, despite fruitful research on citation practices. It also remains largely unknown whether variations in citation-based voice construction exist in doctoral theses completed across training contexts. This study explores and compares authorial voice constructed in citation in the literature review chapters of 20 doctoral theses written by home-grown and overseas-trained Chinese writers (HGWT and OTWT), complemented by interviews with four of the 20 writers. It was found that compared to the HGWT, the OTWT displayed significantly greater use of non-integral citations, \u201cauthor as agent\u201d integral forms, and summary that contribute to authorial voice. Descriptive statistics for the two subcorpora also suggested that authorial voice was more often communicated via lexical devices loaded with evaluation by the ten home-grown writers whereas the ten overseas-trained writers preferred syntactic and discoursal devices. While the present results are more suggestive than deterministic, this study highlights the importance of promoting novice writers' awareness of the obscure and often unnoticed role of citation in constructing authorial voice.", "\u201cWhy am I paraphrasing?\u201d: Undergraduate ESL writers' engagement with source-based academic writing and reading ": "One of the most common and vital areas of coverage in second language (L2) writing instruction is writing from sources, that is, the process of reading source text material and transferring content from that reading to writing. Research as well as everyday practice in the classroom has long shown that working with source texts is one of the most challenging of all academic literacy activities for L2 writers. This is particularly true in the domain of paraphrasing, an important and yet complicated device for the treatment of source text material. While the procedures involved in paraphrasing source text material may appear simple, the enactment of those procedures is a complex and often elusive experience for L2 writers. In this article we discuss a study of two mainland Chinese students' engagement with paraphrasing in an undergraduate academic writing course, with a particular focus on their understanding of the purposes and functions of paraphrasing and how such understanding influenced their paraphrasing practices. Our results reveal a multilayered relationship between the students and paraphrasing and contribute to the paraphrasing literature by drawing greater attention to paraphrasing from students' perspectives.", "Academic emotions in written corrective feedback situations ": "Although written corrective feedback (WCF) is often believed to evoke negative emotions, empirical studies on L2 students' affective reactions to this teaching and learning device are still lacking. Informed by research on academic emotions (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun & Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2012), the paper reports on two case studies investigating Chinese university EFL students' emotional reactions to teacher WCF. Self-report data collected from retrospective verbal reports and interviews constituted most of the data, supplemented by observation notes, student writing, and class documents. Qualitative data analysis revealed the richness and dynamicity of the focal students\u2019 emotional reactions to WCF. While both students reported being emotionally undisturbed by WCF, they in fact experienced different discrete emotions with varying object foci, valence, and activation, and these emotions fluctuated in the revision process. The findings question the presumed connection between WCF and negative emotions, suggesting the inadequacy of the positive-negative distinction of emotions and the need for a more nuanced understanding of emotional reactions to feedback.", "The futures of EAP genre studies: A personal viewpoint ": "This argumentative essay opens with the suggestion that EAP genre analysts and practitioners may legitimately differ with regard to the appropriate size and extent of genres. It then argues that certain recent popular topics in genre studies have been overdone, and then goes on to suggest and illustrate areas that could be more fruitfully investigated. It closes with a discussion of whether EAP studies remain \u2018too textual\u2019 and how greater attention to contextual factors and influences might be obtained.", "Effect of an EAP unit on EFL student effective and appropriate source-use skills ": "It is widely believed source-use skills are among the most important academic literacy skills that students need to develop throughout their college years. Although there has been extensive discussion of the difficulties experienced by ESL/EFL students developing these skills, few studies have focused on instructional interventions designed specifically to build source-use skills. To the best of our knowledge, no intervention recorded in the literature has focused on both essential aspects of source use \u2014 effective as well as appropriate source use at the same time. In this classroom-based study, we investigated whether a source-use oriented EAP unit can markedly improve student source-use skills. Results showed that the EAP unit led to significant improvement in three out of the four operations under source-use effectiveness, that is, using sources for giving support to an argument, establishing links among sources, and integrating source texts into one's own writing; the EAP unit led to significant improvement in all three operations under source-use appropriateness, namely, adequate attribution to source authors, accurate representation of source ideas, and substantial transformation of source language. A number of pedagogical implications were drawn from this study.", "Pandora's box: academic perceptions of student plagiarism in writing ": "Plagiarism is viewed by many academics as a kind of Pandora's box\n                        1\n                     \n                     \n                        1\n                        From Pandora's box \u201cthere issued from it a multitude of evils and distempers, which dispersed themselves all over the world, and which, from that fatal moment have never ceased to afflict the human race\u201d Lempriere (1864, p. 450).\n                     \u2014the elements contained inside are too frightening to allow escape for fear of the havoc that may result. Reluctance by academic members of staff to discuss student plagiarism openly may contribute to the often untenable situations we, as teachers, face when dealing with student plagiarism issues. In this article, I examine the dilemmas English for Academic Purposes (EAP) staff face when dealing with student plagiarism in the tertiary classroom.

My research indicates that not only is an agreed definition of plagiarism difficult to reach by members of staff teaching the same subject, but plagiarism is a multi-layered phenomenon encompassing a spectrum of human intention. Evaluating the spectrum can lead to differences in the implementation of university plagiarism policy, the result of which embodies issues of equity. The aim of the article is to encourage policy-makers and academic staff to acknowledge the concerns about implementation of plagiarism policy. Collaborative, cross-disciplinary re-thinking of plagiarism is needed to reach workable solutions.", "\u2018The learning never ends\u2019: Exploring teachers\u2019 views on the transition from General English to EAP ": "English for Academic Purposes (EAP) in the UK continues to assert its distinctness from \u2018General English\u2019, whilst at the same time actively recruiting its new teachers from a \u2018General English\u2019 background. Despite this, very little has been written about how English teachers should be trained or supported when making the transition to EAP. This paper comprises a critical review of the available literature, highlighting some of its problems and limitations, before progressing to describe a piece of research which attempted to address some of those shortcomings by exploring a number of teachers\u2019 views of the challenges faced when beginning to teach EAP, their thoughts on how these challenges can be overcome, and their views on whether EAP teacher qualifications might assist in the process. Through semi-structured interviews with six EAP teachers in the UK, a picture emerges of the transition to EAP as a long-term process, which teachers see as concerning the development of their knowledge (as opposed to their skills) and which can be assisted both by qualifications, and a range of informal development activities. TEAP qualifications are deemed valuable if combined with experience, but are not felt to be useful as a pre-service training measure.", "Knowledge construction of discussion/conclusion sections of research articles written by English L1 and L2 and Castilian Spanish L1 writers ": "The paper investigates the Discussion/Conclusion sections of research articles (RA) written by English L1, English L2 and Spanish L1 writers in applied linguistics, seeking to assist scholars in Spain and Latin America to get published in reputable international English-language journals, i.e. those listed in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). It draws on move analysis, contrasting texts written in two languages and by three groups of writers, a first in the literature. The study will advance our understanding of the complexity of these RA sections, and the difficulties faced by scholars whose first language is not English but who are under institutional pressure to publish in English. Results showed variances in the move structures in the Discussion/Conclusion sections written by the three groups. The English L1 group produced more rhetorically complex texts than the Spanish L1 group, while the English L2 group displayed hybridity in their texts as they brought to the fore the rhetorical practices of their L1 culture. The findings are expected to assist scholars to make their intellectual contributions accessible in mainstream international publications, whatever their native language.", "The social and cultural life of non-native English speaking international graduate students at a Canadian university ": "It is generally believed that international graduate students have difficulties adapting to a wide range of social and academic situations within the university community. This paper reports on an interview study that addresses the social and cultural life of 12 non-native English speaking (NNES) international graduate students in the following four aspects: (1) relationships with supervisors and instructors; (2) experiences as teaching assistants; (3) communication with colleagues and friends; and (4) social life. Results are illustrated with the students' own words. The findings indicate that student experiences are varied and the adaptation process depends on both internal and external factors. Many of the students we interviewed seemed very well adapted to the university life despite the fact that they had not made an intentional effort to contact native English speaking (NES) students. These students seemed to have learned about the host culture mostly through a network of students with similar cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Implications of the findings for effective communication in intercultural interactions among NNES and NES students, faculty and staff, and future research on intercultural adaptation are discussed.", "Theme-Rheme structure in Chinese doctoral students' research writing ---- From the first draft to the published paper ": "This study examines the first draft and the published version of the Discussion sections of 20 medical research articles produced by Chinese doctoral students to track the changes in Theme-Rheme structure made in the process of revision. The results show that the modifications included conjunctive adjuncts and coordinating conjunctions that were used improperly in the first drafts. Half of the projecting clauses starting with the first person pronoun \u201cwe\u201d were changed. More than half of the long, fully lexicalized pre-subject ideational components were modified so that the topic-revealing information could be reached more quickly. Most importantly, the majority of information discontinuity, represented by deviated thematic progressions, was adjusted through revision, which greatly increased the readability of the papers. In summary, the modifications in terms of Theme-Rheme structure are prominent and contribute essentially to the readability as well as publishability of the articles. Novice ESL/EFL research writers may lack and need the knowledge of the structure even though they are advanced language learners/users. It is recommended that explicit instructions regarding the structure be incorporated in a graduate-level writing class and teacher training be performed to ensure effective instruction.", "Unacylated ghrelin is correlated with the decline of bone mineral density after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in obese Chinese with type 2 diabetes ": "Background\n                  Bariatric surgery is an effective and therapeutic way for different metabolic diseases. It has become a focus of attention about the effects and molecular mechanisms to bone metabolism.\n               \n               \n                  Objective\n                  We aim to assess the changes of bone mineral density (BMD) among Chinese obese individuals with type 2 diabetes who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Two ghrelin gene products, namely unacylated ghrelin (UAG) and obestatin, were evaluated the roles in this pathologic process.\n               \n               \n                  Setting\n                  University-affiliated hospital, China.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Thirty patients who had received RYGB were enrolled in the study. Changes in anthropometric parameters, metabolic indexes, and serum UAG and obestatin were assessed preoperatively, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. BMD at lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH) were identified.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  RYGB resulted in statistical reductions of BMD in 3 different skeletal parts. After the first 6 months, BMD began to reduce and maintained a declining trend until 24 months postoperatively. Comparing to baseline, the maximal reduction of BMD was as high as 10.28% in total hip. The plasma concentration of UAG increased after 6 months (51.61 \u00b1 55.21 versus 71.95 \u00b1 64.91 pg/mL; P < .01), as well as the serum obestatin level (1.65 \u00b1 0.88 versus 1.71 \u00b1 0.99 ng/mL; P\u00a0> .05). Although there was a slight drop of both peptides in the first year, they were still above the baseline. Notably, in the second year, UAG and obestatin rose to their peak values, respectively (91.90 \u00b1 77.11 pg/mL and 1.74 \u00b1 1.09 ng/mL). There was a negative correlation between UAG and BMD in all sites. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the UAG level was the independent parameter associated with BMD at baseline (FN: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-.407, P = .012 and TH: \u03b2 = -0.396, P = .030 respectively), as well as the changes of UAG that were independently related with reduction percentage of LS BMD after 24 months (\u03b2 = - .379, P = .046).\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  The reduction of BMD in obese Chinese with type 2 diabetes was observed after RYGB. The pronounced increase of serum UAG acts as an independent risk factor for the decrease of BMD.", "Clinical outcome of patients undergoing abdominoplasty after massive weight loss ": "Background\n                  Abdominoplasty is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures to reshape the body contour in patients who have undergone massive weight loss.\n               \n               \n                  Objectives\n                  This study was undertaken to assess the clinical outcome, complication rates, and risk factors for complications of patients undergoing abdominoplasty after massive weight loss.\n               \n               \n                  Setting\n                  University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.\n               \n               \n                  Method\n                  Clinical outcome was retrospectively analyzed in 121 patients, who underwent abdominoplasty.

Reoperations were necessary in 2 patients (1.7%) due to postoperative bleeding and tissue necrosis of the navel. Tissue necrosis was significantly more often seen in a subset individual with type 2 diabetes (P = .006). Moreover, the rate of reoperations was significantly higher in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular illnesses compared with cardiovascular healthy patients (P = .036). Multivariate analysis analyzing risk factors for postoperative complications, including sex, age, BMI, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease, revealed strong independent relevance for type 2 diabetes (P = .024).\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  We found that abdominoplasty is a safe operative procedure.

This study was conducted to compare efficacy of multiple linear regression (MLR) and hybrid method of genetic algorithm with artificial neural network (GA-ANN) for prediction of near-saturated soil hydraulic properties in Moghan plain, north-western Iran. The results of MLR analysis indicated that this method had low potential to predict near-saturated soil hydraulic properties in the study area, which only could explain 14\u201338% of variability in the studied properties. Otherwise, GA-ANN was much higher powerful that could explain about 35\u201380% of total variability in the mentioned properties in the study area. The results of sensitivity analysis suggest that soil particle size distribution, organic matter, electrical conductivity and relative bulk density were the most crucial with variety of priorities for explaining variability of the near-saturated soil hydraulic properties in the study area in the semiarid region. In overall, it was concluded that application of intelligent system using the easily available soil properties as predictors could provide reliable estimates of near-saturated soil hydraulic properties at the filed scale.", "Hydrological regime change and its ecological responses in East Dongting Lake, China ": "Extent, frequency and duration of lake water level fluctuations (WLF) are dominant forces controlling the functioning of lake ecosystems, especially in the lake's littoral and aquatic-terrestrial interface processes. In East Dongting Lake, Carex life history synchronize the arrival of overwintering birds, Carex meadow provide vital wintering ground for migratory waterbirds, especially for the Lesser White-fronted Geese. However, significant changes had taken place in the hydrological regime of East Dongting Lake and our research showed it caused chiefly by sediment deposition in the lake basin and the replenishment of the Three Gorges Dam. The annual lowest water level of the East Dongting Lake had gradually risen and the annual water level amplitude had decreased obviously over the past 60 years. Since the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, the average water level increased significantly from January to June. The Three Gorges Dam holder the incoming water from late September to late October that the status will change from flood control limited water level to normal water level, meanwhile the water level of East Dongting Lake declined significantly through the same duration, especially in October. The operation of the Three Gorges Dam decreased flooding days in the areas above 22-m elevation, resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation-covered area and synchronous downward movement of vegetation distribution pattern.

Microcystis is a genus of freshwater cyanobacteria, which poses a possible cause for concern due to its excessive growth and potential for toxin production, which can be aggravated by intensive eutrophication of freshwaters and climate changes. Factors that can potentially affect the biology, ecology and evolution of cyanobacteria are cyanophages. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding cyanophages specific to Microcystis sp. in the natural environment of East Asia and Central Europe. Being a group of planktonic viruses, cyanophages have been studied since the 1960s; information on viruses specific to Microcystis sp. was first obtained in the 1970s and are being dynamically developing over the last two decades. There are eight strains of cyanophages capable of lysing Microcystis sp. cells reported to date, belonging to Myoviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae families, as well as forming Corticovirus-like particles. Available literature data indicates that the gene encoding the sheath protein of the contractile tail (g91) is a good molecular marker for tracing Microcystis viruses from Myoviridae as a form of environmental analysis. It has been suggested that in natural ecosystems, this group of cyanophages can cause a shift in the host population from predominant \u2018cyanophage infection-sensitive\u2019 to \u2018cyanophage infection-insensitive\u2019 cells, rather than influencing the total number of Microcystis sp. It was found that nucleotide sequence of the g91 gene fragment isolated from Central Europe was 95% similar to that of its counterparts from East Asia. However, the research based on molecular primers specific to the Microcystis sp. viruses is limitted to two of the known strains to date. It is suggested that further studies in molecular biology and ecology of Microcystis sp. cyanophages should be based on metagenomics accompanied with physicochemical environmental variables.", "Kinetics and simulation of nitrification at various pH values of a polluted river in the tropics ": "Nitrification is simulated in existing water quality models by multiplying the rate with the attenuation factors for water temperature and dissolved oxygen. The effect of pH, substrates and bacteria is mostly neglected. Moreover, the two-step nitrification is simplified to a one-step process. The aim of this study is to investigate the kinetics of two-step nitrification and to simulate this process. Consequently, the importance of considering the effect of pH, substrate and bacteria in nitrification modelling of river basins is emphasized. For this, an experiment was performed on water taken from the Tay Ninh River in Vietnam. The results show a low actual ammonium oxidation rate in the water column of the river. The ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at pH 5 while the nitrite oxidation is strongly inhibited at pH 8.5. In comparison to the ammonium oxidizers (AOB), the nitrite oxidizers (NOB) are rarely inhibited at low pH. Numerical simulation of the experiment delivered ammonium oxidation rates kA\n                      and nitrite oxidation rates kN\n                      for different pH values. The kA\n                      for pH values lower than 6 is very low. It increases rapidly as the pH increases from 6 to 6.5. We also found out that pH values of 7.5 and 7 are optimal for the activity of AOB and NOB, respectively. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the effect of pH, substrate and bacteria on the nitrification research in river basins. In doing so, nitrification can be simulated more realistically and sustainable water management can be carried out more successfully.", "Ecological conditions and ecosystem services of wetlands in the Lake Tana Area, Ethiopia ": "Although wetlands are known to provide vital ecosystem services, the current state of wetlands in Ethiopia in terms of their ecosystem service components remains poorly understood. Wetlands located in the UNESCO Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve have been highly degraded, but possess highly valuable resources. Therefore, this study sought to assess the major ecological states and identify the main ecosystem services (ESs), along with local people's perceptions of wetland management. Nine wetlands were selected from pristine/reference, agricultural and urban land uses of the Lake Tana area. Numerous ESs were identified, categorized into four main ecosystem services, analyzed using a conceptual model adopted for this purpose, and their ecological conditions were assessed using a range of methods. The results revealed that the provisioning and cultural services were found to surpass the regulatory and supporting services of wetlands in agricultural and urban types, as compared to wetlands located in pristine areas. Although most of the local residents positively viewed wetland regulation and supporting services, weak policy and decision support such as wetland use planning, investment interventions and communal land ownership, and poor development of diversified livelihood were found to pose major challenges to sustainable utilization of wetland resources. The range of plant species diversity among the impaired wetlands was observed to be related to the degree of disturbance, with urban and agricultural wetlands being highly degraded as compared to pristine wetlands. Moreover, these impaired wetlands were found to be invaded by upland and exotic weeds, out-competing the socioeconomically and ecologically important native species.", "Status of wetlands in India: A review of extent, ecosystem benefits, threats and management strategies ": "Study region\n                  India.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  India has a wealth of wetland ecosystems that support diverse and unique habitats.

Further, majority of research on wetland management in India relates to the limnological aspects and ecological/environmental economics of wetland management. But, the physical (such as hydrological and land use changes in the catchment) and socio-economic processes leading to limnological changes have not been explored substantially.", "A review of the current state of research on the water, energy, and food nexus ": "Study region\n                  Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  The purpose of this paper is to review and analyze the water, energy, and food nexus and regions of study, nexus keywords and stakeholders in order to understand the current state of nexus research.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights\n                  Through selected 37 projects, four types of nexus research were identified including water\u2013food, water\u2013energy\u2013food, water\u2013energy, and climate related.

This paper reviews the evidence concerning the combined impacts of urbanisation and climate on the urban water environment of inland catchments of the United Kingdom and assesses the degree of confidence in reported directions of change and response. It also assesses the utility of the evidence for setting environmental legislation and managing the urban water environment in the future and identifies knowledge gaps that limit effective and management interventions.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights\n                  There is a lack of nationally research focused on the dual impacts of climate change and urbanisation on flooding and water quality in UK urban areas. This is despite there being a clear acceptance that flood risk is increasing, water quality is generally not meeting desirable levels, and that combined population and climate change projections pose a pressing challenge. The available evidence has been found to be of medium-high confidence that both pressures will result in (i) an increase in pluvial and fluvial flood risk, and (ii) further reduction in water quality caused by point source pollution and altered flow regimes. Evidence concerning urban groundwater flooding, diffuse pollution and water temperature was found to be more sparse and was ascribed a low-medium confidence that both pressures will further exacerbate existing issues. The confidence ascribed to evidence was also found to reflect the utility of current science for setting policy and urban planning. Recurring factors that limit the utility of evidence for managing the urban environment includes: (i) climate change projection uncertainty and suitability, (ii) lack of sub-daily projections for storm rainfall, (iii) the complexity of managing and modelling the urban environment, and (iv) lack of probable national-scale future urban land-use projections. Suitable climate products are increasingly being developed and their application in applied urban research is critical in the wake of a series of extreme flooding events across the UK and timely for providing state-of-the-art evidence on which to base possible future water quality legislation in a post Brexit-WFD era.", "Impacts of land use and land cover change on surface runoff, discharge and low flows: Evidence from East Africa ": "Region\n                  East Africa.\n               \n               \n                  Focus\n                  A review of catchment studies (n=37) conducted in East Africa evaluating the impacts of Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) on discharge, surface runoff, and low flows.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights\n                  Forest cover loss is accompanied by increased stream discharges and surface runoff. No significant difference in stream discharge is observed between bamboo and pine plantation catchments, and between cultivated and tea plantation catchments. Trend analyses show that despite forest cover loss, 63% of the watersheds show non-significant changes in annual discharges while 31% show increasing trends. Half of the watersheds show non-significant trends in wet season flows and low flows while 35% reveal decreasing trends in low flows. Modeling studies estimate that forest cover loss increases annual discharges and surface runoff by 16\u00b15.5% and 45\u00b114%, respectively. Peak flows increased by a mean of 10\u00b12.8% while low flows decreased by a mean of 7\u00b15.3%. Increased forest cover decreases annual discharges and surface runoff by 13\u00b11.9% and 25\u00b15%, respectively. Weak correlations between forest cover and runoff (r=0.42, p<0.05), mean discharge (r=0.63, p<0.05) and peak discharge (r=0.67, p<0.05) indicate that forest cover alone is not an accurate predictor of hydrological fluxes in East African catchments. The variability in these results supports the need for long-term field monitoring to better understand catchment responses and to improve the calibration of currently used simulation models.", "A new global database of meteorological drought events from 1951 to 2016 ": "Study region\n                  This study has three spatial scales: global (0.5\u00b0), macro-regional, and country scale. The database of drought events has specific entries for each macro-region and country.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  We constructed a database of meteorological drought events from 1951 to 2016, now hosted by the Global Drought Observatory of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. Events were detected at macro-regional and country scale based on the separate analysis of the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at different accumulation scales (from 3 to 72 months), using as input the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Time Series datasets. The database includes approximately 4800 events based on SPEI-3 and 4500 based on SPI-3. Each event is described by its start and end date, duration, intensity, severity, peak, average and maximum area in drought, and a special score to classify 52 mega-droughts.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights for the region under study\n                  We derived trends in drought frequency and severity, separately for SPI and SPEI at a 12-month accumulation scale, which is usually related to hydrological droughts. Results show several drought hotspots in the last decades: Amazonia, southern South America, the Mediterranean region, most of Africa, north-eastern China and, to a lesser extent, central Asia and southern Australia. Over North America, central Europe, central Asia, and Australia, the recent progressive temperature increase outbalanced the increase in precipitation causing more frequent and severe droughts.", "Comparison of hydrological models for the assessment of water resources in a data-scarce region, the Upper Blue Nile River Basin ": "Study region\n                  The Lake Tana Basin (15,114km2) in Ethiopia, which is a source of the Blue Nile River Basin.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  We assessed daily streamflow predictions by applying two simple conceptual models and one complex model for four major gauged watersheds of the study area and compared these model\u2019s capabilities in reproducing observed streamflow in the time and quantile domains.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights for the region\n                  The multi-criteria based model comparison shows that the simple conceptual models performed best in smaller watersheds for reproducing observed streamflow in the time domain, whereas the complex model performed best for the largest watershed. For reproducing observed streamflow in the quantile domain, the simple conceptual models performed best for simulation of high, moist, mid-range, and dry-flows in the Gilgelabay watershed; of dry and low-flows in the Gummera and Megech watersheds; and of high flows in the Ribb watershed. For the remaining flow ranges of each watershed, the complex model performed better. This study also addressed the sensitivity of the complex model for the number of partitioned subbasins. In the largest watershed, the performance of the complex model improved when the number of partitioned subbasins was increased. This finding indicates that the distributed models are especially applicable for the complex watershed because of its physical heterogeneity. In general, integrating these three models may be suitable for water resources assessment.", "Groundwater potential assessment using GIS and remote sensing: A case study of Guna tana landscape, upper blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia ": "Study region\n                  Guna Tana Landscape, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  This paper aimed to delineate the groundwater potential zones using GIS and remote sensing. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) technique is used to develop the groundwater potential prospect zones by integrating different groundwater contributing thematic layers. The thematic layers of land cover, drainage density, lineament density, soil, geology, slope, and geomorphology were prepared and used for groundwater potential map development by assigning weights to each thematic layer and features. The weights of each thematic layer were assigned and normalized based on their characteristic and relationship with groundwater recharge. Finally, the thematic maps were integrated by a weighted sum overlay analysis tool to develop groundwater prospect zones.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights for the region\n                  It was found that the downstream parts of the Landscape showed excellent groundwater potential covering about 833.49\u202fkm2 area with a flat and lacustrine sediment characteristic. About 469.12\u202fkm2 of the landscape showed very good groundwater potential zone. Northern, northeastern and southeastern parts of the area presented very poor groundwater prospect covering about 553.68\u202fkm2 area. The groundwater potential map was validated using the existing pumping wells and it indicated a good prediction accuracy of 70.5%. Thus, the potential zones identified in the study area by the MCDA technique are reliable.", "Groundwater systems of the Indian Sub-Continent ": "The Indian Sub-Continent is one of the most densely populated regions of the world, hosting \u223c23% of the global population within only \u223c3% of the world's land area. It encompasses some of the world's largest fluvial systems in the world (River Brahmaputra, Ganges and Indus Basins), which hosts some of the highest yielding aquifers in the world. The distribution of usable groundwater in the region varies considerably and the continued availability of safe water from many of these aquifers (e.g. Bengal Basin) is constrained by the presence of natural contaminants. Further, the trans-boundary nature of the aquifers in the Indian Sub-Continent makes groundwater resource a potentially politically sensitive issue, particularly since this region is the largest user of groundwater resources in the world. Indeed, there is considerable concern regarding dwindling well yield and declining groundwater levels, even for the highly productive aquifers. Though irrigation already accounts for >85% of the total ground water extraction of the region, there is a mounting pressure on aquifers for food security of the region. Highly variable precipitation, hydrogeological conditions and predicted, impending climate change effects provide substantial challenges to groundwater management. The observed presence of natural groundwater contaminants together with the growing demand for irrigated food production and predicted climate change further complicate the development of strategies for using groundwater resources sustainably. We provide an introduction and overview of 11 articles, collated in this special issue, which describe the current condition of vulnerable groundwater resources across the Indian Sub-Continent.", "Total water storage variability from GRACE mission and hydrological models for a 50,000 km2 temperate watershed: the Garonne River basin (France) ": "Study Region\n                  Garonne Basin, France.\n               \n               \n                  Study Focus\n                  This study analyses water mass variations for the whole Garonne basin (50,000\u202fkm2 drainage area). To do so, Total Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) from seven global solutions based on the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission measurements (\u02dc300\u202fkm spatial resolution) are inter-compared with TWSA from two hydrological models, SAFRAN-ISBA-MODCOU (SIM) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), between January 2003 and December 2010.\n               \n               \n                  New Hydrological Insights for the Region\n                  Despite the small size of the Garonne basin compared to GRACE spatial resolution, good agreement between GRACE solutions and hydrological model TWSA has been found (maximum correlation coefficient \u02dc0.9 and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE, \u02dc0.7). These datasets showed that TWSA in the Garonne basin is mainly due to water stored in the first dozen meters of soil and in the shallow aquifer. To a smaller extent, snow also influences Garonne TWSA. Open surface water TWSA is quite small and TWSA from deep aquifer is negligible. The most important drought period occurred in 2011/2012, due to low precipitation during the two hydrological years and ETR close to previous years. Important precipitation in 2013/2014 helps to refill the water stocks. This study also showed that GRACE and models mismatches should be due to GRACE poor spatial resolution, but also to its monthly time resolution (rarely shown in previous studies).", "Hot spring resort development in Laguna Province, Philippines: Challenges in water use regulation ": "Study region\n                  Calamba and Los Ba\u00f1os in Laguna Province, Philippines lie between the northern part of Mt.

Presence of hot springs is due to the geothermal activities in the area. This study seeks to explore the nature and possible impacts of groundwater utilization in hot spring resorts in Calamba and Los Ba\u00f1os in Laguna Province. This study also analyzes the issues and challenges in the implementation of policies and laws to regulate water use in these resorts.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights for the region\n                  These water resorts are estimated to consume large volume of groundwater which could result to over-extraction and decrease in groundwater quantity. However, monitoring and regulation of usage is difficult as most of these resorts operate without water use permits. If groundwater use is left unregulated, water availability for the resorts industry and for domestic, commercial and other uses in the future will be negatively affected. It is necessary to strengthen implementation of laws and enhance partnerships among national and local government agencies, private sector, civil society and communities, in the proper monitoring and regulation of groundwater resources to promote sustainability.", "Determining spatial and temporal changes of surface water quality using principal component analysis ": "Study region\n                  Shahr Chai River, Lake Urmia basin, Iran.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  The present study investigated the ability of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique in pointing the environmental effects of discharges from different activities. Major indicator parameters were extracted for water quality analysis of the Shahr Chai River located in Lake Urmia basin, Iran. The water quality parameters were measured monthly in six stream reaches and were affected by discharges from intensive recreational centers and rural and agricultural activities.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights\n                  The results showed that the NSFWQI and the WQImin-p could not distinguish between highly impacted stream reaches, while the calculated WQImin-c with two parameters including turbidity and fecal coliforms could meaningfully classify the sampling stations. These two parameters were selected based on results from correlation matrix. This study showed that calculation of the WQImin-c was an effective and easily applicable assessment method for different effluents\u2019 impacts on stream water quality. The PCA technique could justifiably show different landscape effects on river water quality whereby the river downstream was found to experience decreased water quality.", "Impact of climate change on water resources of upper Kharun catchment in Chhattisgarh, India ": "Study region\n                  The Upper Kharun Catchment (UKC) is one of the most important, economically sound and highly populated watersheds of Chhattisgarh state in India.

Hydrological simulations, performed by SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), indicate over-proportional runoff-rainfall and under-proportional percolation-rainfall relationships. Simulated annual discharge for 2020s will decrease by 2.9% on average (with a decrease of 25.9% for q1 to an increase by 23.6% for q14); for 2050s an average increase by 12.4% (17.6% decrease for q1 to 39.4% increase for q0); for 2080s an average increase of 39.5% (16.3% increase for q1 to an increase of 63.7% for q0). Respective ranges on percolation: for 2020s an average decrease by 0.8% (12.8% decrease for q1 to an increase of 8.7% for q14); for 2050s an average increase by 2.5% (10.3% decrease for q1 to 15.4% increase for q0); for 2080s an average increase by 7.5% (0.3% decrease for q1 to 13.7% increase for q0). These over- and under-proportional relationships indicate future enhancement of floods and question sufficiency of groundwater recharge.", "Impacts of climate change on hydrological regime and water resources management of the Koshi River Basin, Nepal ": "Study region\n                  The middle hilly region of the Koshi River Basin in Nepal.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  Assessment is made of the hydrological regime of the basin under climate change. Results from two Regional Climate Models (PRECIS-HADCM3Q0 and PRECIS-ECHAM05), based on IPCC-SRES A1B scenario, were bias corrected against historical gauged data. Hydrological impact simulations were conducted using SWAT model. Design flood estimation was done after extreme value analysis based on annual flow maxima.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights for the region\n                  The study found that climate change does not pose major threat on average water availability. However, temporal flow variations are expected to increase in the future. The magnitude of projected flow for given return periods, however, strongly depends on the climate model run considered. The ECHAM05 results show higher flow changes than those estimated from the HADCM3 outputs. A relation was derived to estimate projected flood flow as a function of return period and flow estimated from historical series. Amidst the uncertainties, these predictions provide reasonable insight for re-consideration of design standards or design values of hydraulic structures under climate change.", "Regional scale hydrologic modeling for prediction of water balance, analysis of trends in streamflow and variations in streamflow: The case study of the Ganga River basin ": "Study region\n                  Ganga River basin.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  The availability of freshwater has been recognized as a global issue, and the reliable evaluation and quantification of it within the basin is necessary to bolster the sustainable management of water.

However, there are large variations in both temporal and spatial distribution of the hydrological components. Statistical methods have been used for detecting trends and critical changes in streamflow. It has been found that although the streamflow from the snow fed areas has increased, the stream flow in the lower reaches and the non-perennial tributaries have declined significantly. This decline can be attributed to both anthropogenic and exogenous changes. The study also establishes that there has been a substantial reduction in overall water resources availability with respect to Virgin. This information sets the yardstick to the restoration of the hydrological and environmental health of the basin and can lead to better management of water resources under scarcity.", "The biggest drought events in Europe from 1950 to 2012 ": "Study region\n                  Europe, including European Russia, but excluding Greenland, the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Madeira.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  Drought is a complex climate-related phenomenon that can affect different sectors causing economic, social, and environmental impacts. We focus on meteorological and hydrological droughts, defined as shortage of precipitation over several months and we discuss the biggest drought events in 1950\u20132012. To define such drought events we computed three drought indicators, the Standardized Precipitation Index, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, and the Reconnaissance Drought Index and we merged them into a combined indicator at 3-month scale for meteorological and 12-month for hydrological droughts. The indicators have been calculated using the E-OBS gridded data (0.25\u00b0\u00d70.25\u00b0).\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights for the region\n                  Europe has been subdivided into thirteen regions and for each region we determined a list of drought events.

The results showed that the Hargreaves, modified Hargreaves, Ravazzani and Tralkovic equations systematically overestimated ETo with the highest percentage error of estimate (PE). In contrast, Makkink\u2013Hansen, Oudin and Turc equations systematically underestimated ETo. Temperature based equations of Romenenko and Schendel performed relatively better at Fanaye with 5.5% and 9.6% PE, fitting slopes of 0.92 and 1.05, and mean ratio (MR) of 1.00 and 1.14, respectively.

Understanding the challenges of developing a groundwater governance framework for regions of extensive groundwater development versus relatively less-developed areas of groundwater development is important. The groundwater typology is a function of both, the hydrogeological aspects of groundwater and the socio-economic milieu that defines dependency on the groundwater resource, which is significant across users and uses in India. An interdisciplinary perspective is important while managing groundwater resources in India and helping establish groundwater governance.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights for the region\n                  Participatory forms of groundwater management, using \u2018aquifer-based, common pool resource\u2019 approaches have begun to find their way into the practices and policies dealing with groundwater in India.

Cluster analysis identified two clusters of sites based on groundwater contamination controlled by geology. Significantly increasing trends are indicated (p\n                     <0.05) at most sites in fluoride, sodium, EC and TDS, but significantly decreasing trends in silica at 40% sites indicate a possibility of replacement of older groundwater with recent rainfall recharge. Spatial distribution of increasing trends is affected by anthropogenic processes.

It further proposes a unified approach based on hydrological modelling that incorporates realistic measures of uncertainty and that can be applied to the region as a whole using a common methodology. The concept is designed to make the best use of all available data sets, including local observations as well as emerging global data. The suggested approach has scientific credibility (based on previous studies), is technically feasible and offers a range of long-term benefits. The overall conclusion is that without a project of this type, water resources planning and management decisions in the region will continue to be based on inadequate information and unquantified uncertainties.", "Impact of climate change on rainfall over Mumbai using Distribution-based Scaling of Global Climate Model projections ": "Study region\n                  The study is carried out for Mumbai (18\u00b058\u203230\u2033 N, 72\u00b049\u203233\u2033 E).\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  Future projections provided by general circulation models (GCMs) suggest the probability of occurrence of intense rainfall will change in the future. However, GCM data generally need to be downscaled and bias-corrected for impact studies. Although the domains covered by Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are increasing, statistical downscaling of GCM results is the main alternative in many regions. We applied a Distribution-based Scaling (DBS) procedure, with 1975\u20132004 as a reference period, for bias-correcting and downscaling daily rainfall data from nine global climate projections.\n               \n               \n                  New hydrological insights for the region\n                  The evaluation in the reference period showed that the scaled data are able to represent various key statistics.

Using the transient DBS processed projection data, a comprehensive evaluation of key rainfall statistics was performed for three periods: near (2010\u20132040), intermediate (2041\u20132070) and distant future (2071\u20132099). There is an increase in the total accumulated annual rainfall, ranging from 300 to 500mm in the ensemble. Also, a clear seasonal shift and delayed onset of the monsoon season evolves in the projections, with increasing and decreasing rainfall in September and June, respectively. A trend analysis using Student's t and Mann\u2013Kendall tests was performed for 2010\u20132099.

Information on the possible importance of SLR-driven groundwater inundation in California is limited. In this study, the potential for SLR-driven groundwater inundation at three sites (Arcata, Stinson Beach, and Malibu Lagoon) was investigated under 1m and 2m SLR scenarios. These sites provide insight into the vulnerability of Northern California coastal plains, coastal developments built on beach sand or sand spits, and developed areas around coastal lagoons associated with seasonal streams and berms. Northern California coastal plains with abundant shallow groundwater likely will see significant and widespread groundwater emergence, while impacts along the much drier central and southern California coast may be less severe due to the absence of shallow groundwater in many areas. Vulnerability analysis is hampered by the lack of data on shallow coastal aquifers, which commonly are not studied because they are not suitable for domestic or agricultural use. Shallow saline aquifers may be present in many areas along coastal California, which would dramatically increase vulnerability to SLR-driven groundwater emergence and shoaling. Improved understanding of the extent and response of California coastal aquifers to SLR will help in preparing for mitigation and adaptation.", "Major ion chemistry of the Teesta River in Sikkim Himalaya, India: Chemical weathering and assessment of water quality ": "Study Region\n                  Teesta River of Eastern Himalayas, India.\n               \n               \n                  Study Focus\n                  This article addresses the mechanisms of weathering in the Teesta River, for the first time based on the original data of major ions.

However, an increase in the Na/Ca ratio was linked to the increase of Si downstream, indicating that silicate weathering was predominant in the lowlands of Teesta drainage. The rate of silicate weathering is dependent on an overall balance of key factors including gradient, contact time, temperature and vegetation. The higher concentration of cations was balanced by the SO4 originating from the action of H2SO4 and H2CO3 on carbonates and silicates. Rock weathering (carbonate-silicate weathering) is the key mechanism that controls the major ion chemistry of the Teesta River followed by evaporite dissolution.", "Climate change impact on regional floods in the Carpathian region ": "Study region\n                  Tisza and Prut catchments, originating on the slopes of the Carpathian mountains.\n               \n               \n                  Study focus\n                  The study reported here investigates (i) climate change impacts on flood risk in the region, and (ii) uncertainty related to hydrological modelling, downscaling techniques and climate projections.

Despite their importance only eleven TBAs have been subjected to more detailed studies. Cooperation has been formalised for seven TBAs. Most of these TBAs are in North Africa and the Sahel. The recent global Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme compiled information at the national level to describe TBAs in terms of key indicators related to the water resource, socio-economic, and legal and institutional conditions. Availability of data at national level is low, hampering regional assessment. Comparing indicators, from questionnaire surveys, with those from a global water-use model showed variable levels of agreement, calling for further research. Reports on agreements scoping TBA management, indicate that this may be dealt with within international river/lake agreements, but reported inconsistencies between TBA sharing countries also indicate that implementation is limited. Increasing awareness and support to joint TBA management is noticeable amongst international organisations.

In the last 10 years, the term \u201cmicrobial induced calcite precipitation\u201d, or that of \u201cbiogrouting\u201d have gained momentum in the scientific literature. They are often presented as the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in geotechnical engineering applications that will solve many kinds of problems, ranging from soil erosion to landslide risk mitigation and liquefaction protection. Are the claimed benefits of the application of microorganisms in conventional geotechnical problems real? The present review work aims to shape a complete and comprehensive understanding of the progress reported in the field of bio-mediated soil improvement. Specific focus is put on pivotal points in this decade-long path which is marked by proof of fundamental concepts at multiple scales. Among the treated literature, reference is made to over forty studies produced after 2016. As soil bio-reinforcement makes its steps towards claiming a spot in mainstream geotechnical practice this review foresees to offer both a look back on how far research has gone and a look forward by evaluating opportunities and challenges which lie ahead.", "Effect of thermal cycles on volumetric behaviour of Bangkok sand ": "The effect of numerous thermal cycles on the volumetric behaviour of saturated Bangkok sand was investigated using a double thermal oedometer test that incorporates a temperature control system. The tests were performed at various vertical stresses (2.007, 3.211 and 4.014 MPa) on a reconstituted sand having different initial densities and an undisturbed sand from a block sample collected from a depth of 32 m in Bangkok. Up to 100 heating\u2013cooling cycles (each involving 28\u201350\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C steps with a frequency of 1 cycle per hour) were performed at a constant vertical stress in each test and the equilibrated settlement was observed in every cycle. The strains induced by thermal cycles were satisfactorily correlated with the number of cycles using a power law. The maximum thermal cycle-induced strain was 0.0037 (equivalent to a change in relative density of 1.7%) in the case of loose reconstituted sand (initial relative density of 30%) after 100 thermal cycles. The undisturbed sample showed a similar strain of 0.0036 (equivalent to a change in relative density of 1.6%), reflecting its low initial relative density of 44%. Both density and stress level have an influence on the rate of change in log strain over log cycle number. An empirical model was developed using multiple linear regression analysis for predicting vertical strain due to thermal cycles, based on the sand\u2019s relative density and vertical stress.", "Clays in natural and engineered barriers for nuclear waste disposal ": "", "Assessment of geological factors potentially affecting production-induced seismicity in North German gas fields ": "Recovery of hydrocarbons has triggered seismicity in some Rotliegend reservoirs in the Netherlands and in northern Germany. In Germany, these earthquakes have caused negligible structural damage, but raised public concerns in a region of low historic seismic activity. Production-induced seismicity has been successfully addressed by analytic poroelastic models that explain the development of critically stressed faults with pore fluid pressure depletion inside and around reservoirs. The available analytical approaches fail to account for the mechanical stratigraphy and structural complexities occurring in reality, i.e., reservoirs compartmentalized by faults. The present study aims to increase the quantitative understanding of the geological factors that potentially affect production-induced seismicity in North Germany. In the first part of the paper, a series of 2D finite element models is presented to investigate a parameter space for reservoir depth, reservoir thickness, mechanical reservoir and host rock properties, and compartment geometries typically observed in North German Rotliegend gas fields. The second part addresses the impact of mobile salt layers with variable thickness atop the reservoir on fault stability. The results indicate preferred fault reactivation for steeply dipping faults, large Biot\u2013Willis coefficients, inhomogeneous overburden loads, large reservoir thicknesses, a shallow reservoir position and short distances of the salt layer to the reservoir. In the third part we investigate the effects of fault dip and throw along a fault loaded by three depletion scenarios in a compartmentalized intra-graben setting. Maximum fault loading was obtained for the case that fault throw is half of the reservoir thickness and production is exclusively from the footwall block. The main finding is a preferred reactivation of steeply dipping faults (>60\u00b0) caused by the dominant contribution of reservoir compaction to fault loading. Compaction-loading constitutes the main difference to seismicity driven by far field tectonics dominated by horizontal strain, for which faults with dip angles of approximately 60\u00b0\u00a0are predicted favourable for reactivation.", "Influence of temperature on soil\u2013pile interface shear strength ": "Geothermal piles are subjected to daily and seasonal cyclic temperature changes during their life spans. These temperature changes (heat cycles) induce cyclic expansion/contraction along the soil\u2013pile interface that may affect interface properties such as shear strength. A series of direct shear tests was conducted using a temperature controlled direct shear test apparatus to evaluate the effects of heat cycles on soil\u2013pile interface strength. The interface temperature was cycled between 24\u00a0\u00b0 C and 34\u00a0\u00b0 C to simulate the real thermal conditions that an energy pile may experience. Non-cyclic and cyclic thermal loading were applied under different stress states and histories. It was found that the shearing behavior of interface under thermal loading is described through thermally induced changes in Mohr\u2013Coulomb\u2019s parameters of the interface. Moreover, the thermally induced changes in interface strength are mainly controlled by the soil stress state and the soil stress history.", "Heated fiber-optic cables for distributed dry density measurements of granulated bentonite mixtures: Feasibility experiments ": "In the Swiss concept for the disposal of spent fuel and vitrified high-level radioactive waste, the buffer material of the engineered barrier system in the disposal tunnels consists of granulated bentonite mixtures (GBM) and blocks of highly compacted bentonite. For the GBM to perform sufficiently as a barrier, the dry density of the emplaced GBM is an essential parameter as well as a quality control indicator at the time of tunnel backfilling. In this study, an actively heated fiber-optic cable combined with distributed temperature sensing was applied with the aim of estimating the in-situ dry density distribution of the GBM. A set of experiments was performed using GBM specimens with controlled dry density conditions at the Grimsel Test Site in Switzerland to examine how the thermal responses vary with the dry density of the GBM material. The results indicated that the thermal responses were sufficiently sensitive to allow distributed temperature sensing in combination with an actively heated fiber-optic cable to be used as a reliable tool for estimating the dry density profile in the tunnels backfilled and sealed with the GBM along the cable with a high resolution.", "Time-dependent closure of a borehole in a viscoplastic rock ": "The paper describes a model to predict and analyze the time-dependent closure of a borehole drilled in a soft rock subjected to an initial isotropic stress, and the build-up of stress on a rigid casing after contact with the deforming rock. The rock behaves as a viscoplastic material characterized by a Mohr\u2013Coulomb yield criterion and plastic potential, and by a time-dependent stress\u2013strain deviatoric response akin to a Bingham rheology. The model formulation recognizes the particular structure of the solution, namely that the borehole is encircled by an evolving viscoplastic annulus, itself surrounded by an infinite domain, where the rock is either elastic or is unloading elastically. Noting that the solution outside the viscoplastic boundary is given explicitly by the Lam\u00e9 solution, the evolution problem is formulated as an initial boundary value problem in the viscoplastic region only, but with a free boundary \u2014 the growing or shrinking interface between the viscoplastic and the elastic domains. The equations governing the mechanical fields and the evolution of viscoplastic boundary are spatially discretized on a moving mesh with a fixed number of nodes. The final system of equations is a set of first order ODEs that are efficiently solved using the MATLAB routine ODE45. The numerical simulations reveal (i) the time-dependent deformation and stress state of rock in the viscoplastic annulus before and after the contact, (ii) the time of first contact between the deforming rock and the casing, (iii) the effective duration of the stress build-up on the casing, and (iv) the large time contact pressure, which is well approximated by the elastoplastic solution.", "Micromechanical characterization of shales through nanoindentation and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry ": "Shales are heterogeneous sedimentary rocks which typically comprise a variable mineralogy (including compacted clay particles sub-micrometer in size), silt grains, and nanometer sized pores collectively arranged with transversely isotropic symmetry. A detailed understanding of the micro- and sub-microscale geomechanics of these minerals is required to improve models of shale strength and stiffness properties. In this paper, we propose a linked experimental\u2013computational approach and validate a combination of grid nanoindentation and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy and Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS/WDS) at the same spatial locations to identify both the nano-mechanical morphology and local mineralogy of these nanocomposites. The experimental parameters of each method are chosen to assess a similar volume of material. By considering three different shales of varying mineralogy and mechanical diversity, we show through the EMMIX statistical iterative technique that the constituent phases, including highly compacted plate- or sheet-like clay particles, carbonates, silicates, and sulfides, have distinct nano-mechanical morphologies and associated indentation moduli and hardness. Nanoindentation-based strength homogenization analysis determines an average clay packing density, friction coefficient, and solid cohesion for each tested shale sample. Comparison of bulk to microscale geomechanical properties, through bulk porosimetry measurements, reveals a close correspondence between bulk and microscale clay packing densities. The determination of mechanical microstructure and material properties is useful for predictive microporomechanical models of the stiffness and strength properties of shale. The experimental and computational approaches presented here also apply to other chemically and mechanically complex materials exhibiting nanogranular, composite behavior.", "Stress prediction using 1D and 3D geomechanical models of a tight gas reservoir\u2014A case study from the Lower Magdalena Valley Basin, Colombia ": "The characterization of the mechanical properties and stress state of a hydrocarbon or geothermal reservoir and its overburden is crucial for its optimal exploration and exploitation. We present a geomechanical modeling study from the Lower Magdalena Valley Basin in northern Colombia that integrates various borehole and seismic data-sets to build a 3D model for a robust prediction of the mechanical property distribution and the pre-production stress state. The workflow includes the analysis of log and core data as well as hydraulic tests leading to detailed 1D mechanical earth models (MEM) for each of the five wells currently available in the study area. Subsequently, this information is upscaled to and integrated with a structural model derived from 3D seismic interpretation. For this 3D MEM we test two different property population methods and compare the resulting stress prediction. The first method uses a geostatistical approach based exclusively on well data for property interpolation, whereas the second method additionally utilizes seismic inversion techniques to account for the vertical and horizontal differences in mechanical rock properties. The results include a mechanical characterization of the subsurface as well as the complete stress tensor for the reservoir and encompassing formations in the model domain.

Particularly, the migration of fine sediment particles can alter the hydro-mechanical properties of sediments, and reduce long-term hydrocarbon productivity by causing local-clogging around wells. However, questions as to under which circumstances and to what extent the fines migration and pore-clogging occur remain poorly resolved, particularly in association with two-phase flows. Therefore, this study explored the fines migration induced by fluid flows and the resulting pore-clogging in porous media. One-dimensional channel experiments were carried out with sandy sediments containing non-plastic silty fines to examine effects of fluid velocity and mixed fluid flows on pore-clogging occurrence. In single-phase flows, the flow velocity had a pronounced effect on determining the fines behavior, exhibiting from no or minimal fines detachment, through fines migration with no clogging, and to fines migration accompanying pore-clogging with increasing flow velocity. In two-phase flows with mixed gas\u2013water fluids, the presence of gas\u2013water interfaces clearly promoted pore-clogging because the fines were readily collected at gas\u2013water interfaces, resulting in high particle concentration at the menisci. The particle-level force analysis also corroborates the experimental observations, showing that the drag force primarily determined by the flow velocity plays a significant role in the fines detachment against the particle weight in the single-phase flows. In contrast, the gas\u2013water interfacial tension overwhelms the drag force and the particle weight, and thereby, governs pore-clogging behaviors in mixed fluid flow conditions. The presented results provide insights into pore-scale mechanisms of pore-clogging induced by fines migration, which is associated with gas production in HBS, as mixed fluids flow can accompany fines detachment, fines migration, and pore-clogging near wellbores.", "Modeling of subcritical cracking in acidized carbonate rocks via coupled chemo-elasticity ": "Injection of acidized water into the crack process area has been known for long to induce subcritical crack propagation. Acid rain or vegetation decomposition can cause activation or reactivation of landslides at subcritical stress, while acid injection is used to enhance oil and gas reservoir stimulation. Equally promising is acid enhancement of crack propagation in geothermal field stimulation. To quantify the above mentioned processes, crack propagation is simulated using a chemo-elasticity model in which a chemically controlled strain is added to linear elastic strain, in analogy to thermal strain. That strain is proportional to accumulated mass removal, controlled by a chemical reaction. The coefficient of chemical shrinkage is either constant, or is postulated to depend on the level of straining of rock using various scalar measures of either volumetric or shear strain to simulate the dependence of mineral dissolution on micro-cracking. With that formulation an Airy stress function, as in classical linear elasticity solution, has been for the first time, to our knowledge, used for solving chemo-elasticity problem, by employing an additional particular potential term. The results suggest that a constant chemically induced shrinkage alone is not sufficient to produce any significant enhancement of the crack tip displacement. However, making the coefficient of chemical shrinkage dependent on a shear strain invariant (and hence making the constitutive law implicit), leads to an enhancement of crack propagation velocity at a desired level. Yet, the obtained crack propagation acceleration appears to be too modest. That suggests that to obtain realistic results, in addition to diffusive transport, the advective\u2013reactive transport process (especially, permeability) should be as well coupled to deformation.", "Numerical modelling of energy piles in saturated sand subjected to thermo-mechanical loads ": "This study investigates the impact that different magnitudes and combinations of thermal and axial mechanical loads have on the mechanical behaviour of energy piles in saturated sand.

The magnitude of these phenomena depends on the significance of the applied temperature variation, the significance of the applied mechanical load to the foundation head prior to thermal loading with respect to the pile axial capacity and the soil response to additional loading/unloading processes. These aspects serve a major role in the evolution of the foundation constraint, which governs the mechanical performance of energy piles when subjected to thermo-mechanical loads.", "Full-scale in-situ tests on energy piles: Head and base-restraining effects on the structural behaviour of three energy piles ": "Energy piles, due to their dual roles, are exposed to temperature change throughout their life time, which may cause axial displacements, additional axial stresses and changes in the shaft resistance along their lengths. The extent of these effects highly depends on the level of restrictions along the energy piles, from the surrounding soil, as well as from the superstructure. A full-scale in-situ test has been performed on three energy piles, with the purpose of investigating their thermo-mechanical behaviour with respect to the corresponding end-restraining conditions. Thermal loads with maximum temperature of 45\u00a0\u00b0C and minimum of 8\u00a0\u00b0C were applied to the test piles for a 6-week period along with conventional mechanical load tests. Two of the test piles were designed to have base resistance from the very dense sand layer while the shorter pile was tipped into a stiff clay layer with the purpose of representing different end-restraining conditions. Moreover, the thermal loads were applied to the longer piles with and without the presence of mechanical load at the head. In this paper, the full-scale in-situ test setup is presented, along with the test results of the three test piles giving emphasis to the restraining effects of the mechanical load at the head and the base resistance from underlying soil layers. It is concluded from the results that the distribution of thermally induced axial stresses and the mobilization of shaft resistance during heating and cooling episodes are highly dependent on the location of the dominant restriction. Moreover, the end-restraining effects fade away at depths farther from the dominant restriction, leading to the degree of freedom of test piles with diverse end-restraining conditions to converge.", "Influence of effective stress and temperature on the creep behavior of a saturated compacted clayey soil ": "The compacted clay barrier of shallow depth repositories for wastes would be subjected to temperature variations. Consequently, the hydro-mechanical properties of compacted clays could be progressively modified, and thus affect the performance of repositories. The influence of effective stress and temperature on the creep behavior of a saturated compacted clayey soil was experimentally investigated by performing a series of incremental loading creep tests using a temperature-controlled oedometer. Applied effective vertical stress varied from 10 to 1300\u00a0kPa within a large temperature range of 5\u00a0\n                        \u00b0\n                     C to 70\u00a0\n                        \u00b0\n                     C.

Finally, the main results were discussed and interpreted in the light of a suitable constitutive framework.", "Particle crushing in hydrate-bearing sands ": "The depressurization of natural hydrate deposits to produce methane gas can increase the effective stress in hydrate-bearing sediments, which may induce sand particle crushing. Sand crushing may become detrimental to gas production, because the breakage of sand particles can cause sediment contraction, reduction in permeability, and the generation of finer particles exacerbating solids migration and sand production. This study experimentally investigates particle crushing in tetrahydrofuran hydrate-bearing sands. Sandy specimens with various hydrate saturation are loaded to different stresses (up to 40 MPa) in an instrumented oedometer cell to induce sand crushing. The results show that the presence of hydrate crystals inhibits sand particle crushing. More pronounced sand crushing occurs in specimens with lower hydrate saturation and under higher maximum effective stress. Hydrate crystals can cement neighboring sand particles and constrain the particles from rotating and rearranging during loading. Relatively larger particles in hydrate-bearing sediments experience surface grinding with no significant decreases in particle sizes, and shear-off asperities of the larger particles contribute to an increase in the proportion of smaller particles. The total volumetric strain in hydrate-bearing sediments due to loading can be estimated using the known hydrate saturation and the volumetric strain of hydrate-free sediments subjected to an identical load. The changes in hydraulic conductivity due to sand particle crushing are correlated to the breakage index. The results highlight that gas production from hydrate deposits using depressurization increases the effective stress and the loss of hydrate crystals can exacerbate sand crushing.", "On the influence of thermal cycles on the yearly performance of an energy pile ": "Thermo active piles have been studied as an efficient solution to minimize greenhouse emissions and achieve economic advantages. So far, this technology has received only partial acceptance by the industry, because of the impact on the serviceability of the system in the long-term. The aim of this work is to perform a tool able to numerically investigate the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of a single energy pile, subjected to mechanical and thermal loads, in two sites: London (UK) and Napoli (Italy). The former location is used to validate the developed model against the experimental data available in the literature (Bourne-Webb et al. 2009), while the latter is proposed to evaluate the applicability of such technology in the Neapolitan area. Some analyses on the behaviour of the energy pile have been carried out for approximately one year (400 days), and the influence of daily cycles on modelling processes is underlined comparing the results of three different ways of simulating the same energy demand (considering daily temperature variations, neglecting them, and using average values of temperature). The outcomes show that the thermal-induced displacements, pore water pressure variations and axial loads are influenced by the mode of application of the thermal law and deserve to be taken into account in the geotechnical design, even if, in the Napoli case, are not detrimental to the structural functions of the soil\u2013pile system.\n                  The main goals of the study can be summarized in the following points: (i) the geotechnical performance and the temperature variations provided during heat exchange operations, comparing three different ways of application of the same energy demand, (ii) the role of the hydraulic processes and the key factors that influence the pore water pressure generation, (iii) the thermal sustainability of the energy pile operations. These aspects are useful for the design practice as well as the numerical models.", "Numerical prediction of carbonate elastic properties based on multi-scale imaging ": "Elastic properties predictions of rocks using numerical simulations are generally overestimated compared to laboratory measurements regardless of the algorithms used. This overestimation is prevalent among sandstones as well as carbonate rock types but the degree of the mismatch between the two results is much higher for carbonates due to the complex pore structures and heterogeneity at the pore scales. One key reason attributed towards the systematic overestimation is imaging system\u2019s limitation to resolve pore structures below its threshold resolution at representative volumes. To study the effect of this limitation, we developed a multi-scale imaging approach and \u201cup-scaling\u201d framework to improve the numerical predictions of the linear, isotropic elastic properties of a standard dolomite rock using the Digital Rock Physics approach. We defined up-scaling as the process of integrating information from high resolution images (obtained at micro scale) to improve prediction using the lower resolution images obtained at full-plug scale covering a larger representative volume. A combination of multi-resolution (40, 13, 5 and \n                        1\n                        \n                        \u03bc\n                        m\n                     ) X-ray micro computer tomography and Focus Ion Beam combined with Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB/SEM) images for the dolomite rock were then utilized. We compared numerically simulated linear elastic and isotropic moduli to in-house laboratory acoustic velocity test results performed on the same dolomite carbonate sample that was used for imaging. Results showed a reduction of the overestimation from 8.9% to 4.5% for predicted P-wave velocity and from 11.9% to 7.8% for predicted S-wave velocity when the multi-scale imaging approach was used.", "Hydraulic conductivity and strength of pervious concrete for deep trench drains ": "Pervious concrete for deep trench drains, used to stabilise slopes, must meet many requirements, namely, adequate hydraulic conductivity, adequate shear strength a few days after pouring, capacity to act as a protective filter for soils in which the drain is installed, good resistance to clogging and adequate residual hydraulic conductivity. In current engineering practice, the composition of pervious concrete for drains is improperly selected according to criteria used for no-fines concrete for road pavements. To detect more suitable and specific criteria, a laboratory investigation has been conducted aimed at identifying the composition and the properties of pervious concrete satisfying the above requirements. The results of these tests are reported in the paper. They show that it is possible to devise mix-designs of pervious concrete that satisfy all the abovementioned requirements. Special attention has been paid to the hydraulic conductivity and the strength and to their relationship to the water/cement and the aggregate/cement ratios and to the granulometric composition of the aggregates.", "Sealing behaviour of crushed claystone\u2013bentonite mixtures ": "Crushed claystone mixed with bentonite as a potential material for sealing repositories was extensively investigated. The crushed claystone excavated from the Callovo-Oxfordian clay rock was mixed with bentonite MX80 obtaining a bentonite content of 20% and 40% and compared to pure bentonite and a bentonite\u2013sand (70/30) mixture with respect to relevant sealing properties. These materials were compacted to pre-determined densities and their properties were characterised with respect to compacted density and porosity, mechanical stiffness and stability, water uptake and retention, swelling capacity, water permeability, and gas migration. Main findings include that 1) higher dry densities are achieved with claystone\u2013bentonite mixtures than pure bentonite and bentonite\u2013sand mixture under identical compression loads, which increases mechanical stiffness and stability; 2) the swelling capacity increases with increasing bentonite content and dry density of the mixtures; 3) all the compacted mixtures have low water permeabilities of 10\u221219 \u201310\u221220 m2 being in the same order as intact claystone; and 4) the compacted claystone\u2013bentonite mixtures allow for gas release already at low and moderate pressures, while in contrast high pressures are needed for gas penetrating water-saturated bentonite and bentonite\u2013sand mixtures.", "Mini-Seismic Methods for the in-situ characterization of clay rocks\u2014Examples from URL Meuse/Haute-Marne (France) and HADES URF (Belgium) ": "BGR (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe \u2014\u00a0Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources) has developed a series of ultrasonic and seismic methods, called Mini-Seismic Methods (MSM), for the comprehensive in-situ characterization of potential host rocks for radioactive waste disposal.\n                  Boreholes with a minimum diameter of 86\u00a0mm are used to obtain the desired high spatial resolution of seismic rock parameters.\n                  Dynamic elastic rock parameters, such as Poisson\u2019s ratio and Young\u2019s modulus, and rock features like EDZ/EdZ and borehole stress concentrations are derived from ultrasonic interval velocity and crosshole measurements.\n                  Investigations were performed at the Meuse/Haute-Marne Underground Research Laboratory (Callovo-Oxfordian argillaceous formation, France), over the depth range of 445 m to 504 m.\n                  The major results are the clear depth dependent trends in the extent of EDZ/EdZ, as derived from relevant seismic parameters, the high variability in in-situ derived dynamic elastic parameters around the 445 m depth level and the determination of borehole stress concentrations that correlate well with the existing stress field.\n                  Comparison between in-situ derived dynamic elastic and static elastic moduli that were derived from core material from the same boreholes and same depths show a good correlation.\n                  Further investigations were performed at the High Activity Disposal Experimental Site (Boom Clay, Belgium) at the 223 m depth level.\n                  In the Boom Clay remarkable circular seismic velocity variations were measured, which overlap with the results expected from the site-specific stratification-related anisotropy.

The EDZ represents a possible release path for radionuclides dissolved in the porewater and for gases from corrosion and degradation processes which needs to be addressed quantitatively in Safety Assessment (SA). The EDZ is often represented by a discrete fracture network, whose complexity precludes its implementation in conventional SA models. To overcome this problem, two-dimensional abstraction methodologies have been developed that replace the complex geometry of the discrete fracture network by a hydraulically equivalent continuum model. Although such simple 2D models are amenable to SA modelling, they cannot capture the inherent three-dimensional and stochastic nature of the phenomena associated with the EDZ. In this paper we present a methodology based on Marked Point Processes to infer 3D stochastic continuum models of the EDZ from 2D discrete characterizations of the fracture network. The methodology is illustrated with the calibration of a multi-rate injection experiment in Mont Terri (Switzerland).", "Analysis of the vertical displacement of energy pile groups ": "Over the last fifty years, the interaction factor method has been widely used to address the vertical displacement and the increased deformation of conventional pile groups subjected to mechanical loads when group effects and interactions occur among the piles. Design charts and analytical models have been proposed to serve the considered analysis method. In recent years, the interaction factor method has been extended to address energy pile groups subjected to thermal loads. Design charts have been proposed. However, prior to this study, no analytical models capable of analysing the vertical displacement and the increased deformation of energy piles subjected to thermal loads in a more comprehensive and flexible way than through design charts have been available. To address this challenge, this study presents two analytical models for analysing the vertical displacement of energy pile groups subjected to thermal loads, based on the analysis of a single isolated energy pile. Comparisons with three-dimensional finite element analyses outline that the models can accurately capture the displacement of energy piles without the expense of a full rigorous analysis. This evidence makes the present models useful tools for the analysis and design of energy piles under serviceability conditions.", "Consolidated-undrained triaxial testing of Opalinus Clay: Results and method validation ": "Specific equipment and procedures developed for geomechanical testing of hydrocarbon caprocks were adopted to conduct truly undrained triaxial tests with Opalinus Clay. The amount of pore pressure development during consolidation, and the resulting effective stress, is managed by equilibrating the samples in vacuum desiccators of different relative humidities (vapor equilibration technique) prior to assembling into the test apparatus. A drained consolidation test was first conducted to determine the appropriate strain rate for consolidated-undrained (CU) triaxial testing. Opalinus Clay samples were then consolidated in the triaxial rig to mean effective stresses in the range from 3 to 52 MPa and eventually sheared. Within the explored stress range elastic and pore pressure coupling parameters were found to be stress dependent. The different stress paths to peak indicate a transition from overconsolidated to rather normally consolidated state, yet failure was in all tests dilatant, i.e. associated with a drop in pore pressure and strain-softening (more so at low effective stress). Accurate pore pressure monitoring enabled the discrimination of different deformation stages during deviatoric loading. In terms of Mohr\u2013Coulomb strength parameters, transition from peak to post-peak strength is manifested by a reduction in the effective cohesion whereas the effective friction angle remains nearly constant. The robustness of the CU testing methodology is demonstrated by (i) diagnostic analyses, (ii) inconsistency of CU tests with two CU tests deliberately loaded faster to explore the effect of strain rate, and (iii) consistency of CU tests with two consolidated-drained tests. Finally, test results of two caprock shales are also shown for comparison. The caprocks are of similar basic properties as the Opalinus Clay and stem from a large data base of tests conducted using the same methodology.", "Heat exchange mechanisms in energy tunnel systems ": "Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) systems are known for their efficiency in space heating and cooling, using the ground as a source of energy. The ground energy can be accessed by the implementation of GSHP systems into subsurface structures such as transport tunnels. This technology comprises the embedment of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipes into the tunnel lining, converting it into tunnel ground heat exchangers (tunnel GHEs). There are studies available on the thermal interaction between the ground and the tunnel GHEs in the current literature. However, to properly evaluate the thermal performance of tunnel GHEs, the two-way thermal interaction between the tunnel GHEs and both the ground and the tunnel air must be considered. This requires the consideration of the ground conditions and the tunnel air temperature variations. In this work, the tunnel GHEs, the air inside the tunnel and the surrounding ground are modelled using finite element techniques. The models account for groundwater flow in the ground and induced airflow in the tunnel area. Numerical results highlight the significant effect of groundwater flow velocity on the temperature distribution pattern in the ground, the air temperature variations within the tunnel area and the average fluid temperature within the tunnel GHEs. To accurately capture the temperature variations in the tunnel air, it is crucial to account for both conduction and (induced) convection inside the tunnel as numerical results show significantly different temperature distribution inside the tunnel area in comparison to when only pure conduction is considered. In practice, the very common under/over-estimation of GSHP systems performance (including tunnel GHEs) is related \u2013\u00a0to a certain extent \u2013\u00a0to the lack of understanding regarding the operational environment of these systems (i.e., groundwater flow and tunnel air interactions with the activated lining). It may also lead to an inadequate air ventilation system design.", "Gas transport in compacted bentonite after 18 years under barrier conditions ": "The FEBEX in situ test was a full-scale experiment performed at the Grimsel Test Site (Switzerland) under natural conditions to reproduce the Engineered Barrier System of an underground repository for nuclear waste. After 18 years of operation under natural hydration from the granitic host rock and heating from a heater simulating the waste canister, the experiment was dismantled. The gas permeability of bentonite samples taken during dismantling at different positions around the heater was determined in a custom-built equipment.\n                  The gas permeability of the samples decreased with their water content and dry density. The samples closest to the heater had lower water content and higher dry density, whereas the samples closest to the granite had the highest water content and lowest dry density. Thus, the gas permeability of the samples was related to their position in the barrier, tending to be lower towards the granite, where the degree of saturation was higher, and hence, the void ratio accessible for gas flow, lower. The void ratio accessible for gas flow expresses the ratio between gas accessible volume and particle volume and is computed as \n                        e\n                        \n                           (\n                           1\n                           \u2212\n                           \n                              \n                                 S\n                              \n                              \n                                 r\n                              \n                           \n                           )\n                        \n                     . Because of the high water saturation of most of the barrier after the long operation period, the accessible void ratio was below 0.15 in all the samples tested. The gas permeability of these samples was related to their accessible void ratio in the same way as expected for the FEBEX reference bentonite, decreasing with it according to a power law. In this respect no changes on the gas transport properties of the bentonite took place during operation.\n                  The increase of confining pressure during testing resulted for most samples in an irreversible increase in dry density and consequently a decrease of the gas permeability. Beyond a confining stress of 4 MPa no gas flow took place through any of the wetter samples. In contrast, flow took place through the drier samples even for confining pressures as high as 9 MPa.", "A continental-scale hydrology and water quality model for Europe: Calibration and uncertainty of a high-resolution large-scale SWAT model ": "Summary\n               \n                  A combination of driving forces are increasing pressure on local, national, and regional water supplies needed for irrigation, energy production, industrial uses, domestic purposes, and the environment. In many parts of Europe groundwater quantity, and in particular quality, have come under sever degradation and water levels have decreased resulting in negative environmental impacts. Rapid improvements in the economy of the eastern European block of countries and uncertainties with regard to freshwater availability create challenges for water managers. At the same time, climate change adds a new level of uncertainty with regard to freshwater supplies. In this research we build and calibrate an integrated hydrological model of Europe using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) program. Different components of water resources are simulated and crop yield and water quality are considered at the Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) level. The water resources are quantified at subbasin level with monthly time intervals. Leaching of nitrate into groundwater is also simulated at a finer spatial level (HRU). The use of large-scale, high-resolution water resources models enables consistent and comprehensive examination of integrated system behavior through physically-based, data-driven simulation. In this article we discuss issues with data availability, calibration of large-scale distributed models, and outline procedures for model calibration and uncertainty analysis. The calibrated model and results provide information support to the European Water Framework Directive and lay the basis for further assessment of the impact of climate change on water availability and quality. The approach and methods developed are general and can be applied to any large region around the world.", "Hydropower dams of the Mekong River basin: A review of their hydrological impacts ": "Hydropower production is altering the Mekong River basin\u2019s riverine ecosystems, which contain the world\u2019s largest inland fishery and provide food security and livelihoods to millions of people. The basin\u2019s hydropower reservoir storage, which may rise from \u223c2% of its mean annual flow in 2008 to \u223c20% in 2025, is attenuating seasonal flow variability downstream of many dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs. In addition, tributary diversions for off-stream energy production are reducing downstream flows and augmenting them in recipient tributaries. To help manage tradeoffs between dam benefits (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, domestic water supply, and navigation) and their consequences for livelihoods and ecosystems, we review observed and projected impacts on river flows along both the Mekong mainstream and its tributaries. We include the effects of diversions and inter-basin transfers, which prior reviews of flow alteration in the Mekong basin have largely neglected. We also discuss the extent to which concurrent changes in climate, water demand, and land use, may offset or exacerbate hydropower-induced flow alteration. Our major recommendations for assessing hydrological impacts in the Mekong and other basins undergoing rapid hydropower development include synchronizing and integrating observational and modeling studies, improving the accuracy of reservoir water balances, evaluating multi-objective reservoir operating rules, examining hydropeaking-induced flow alteration, conducting multi-dam safety assessments, evaluating flow indicators relevant to local ecosystems and livelihoods, and considering alternative energy sources and reservoir sedimentation in long-term projections. Finally, we strongly recommend that dam impact studies consider hydrological alteration in conjunction with fish passage barriers, geomorphic changes and other contemporaneous stressors.", "Towards baseflow index characterisation at national scale in New Zealand ": "Streamflow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation, quickflow and baseflow. Baseflow is the portion of streamflow that contains groundwater flow and flow from other delayed sources and is of key importance for river basin ecology and water resources planning and management. The BaseFlow Index (BFI) is defined as the ratio of long-term mean baseflow to total streamflow. Knowledge of the BFI is not directly available for ungauged catchments and hence for most of the terrestrial land surface. In this study, the BFI was determined for all river reaches in New Zealand. First a recursive digital filtering technique was applied to separate baseflow from total streamflow for 482 gauged sites across New Zealand, whereby an individual filter parameter was determined for each catchment. Based on the baseflow and total streamflow data the long-term BFI for each gauged site was determined, as well as seasonal values of BFI. BFI varies between 0.20 and 0.96 with an average of 0.53, which indicates that 53% of long-term streamflow in New Zealand is likely to originate from groundwater discharge and other delayed sources. Long-term BFI values for all river reaches that comprise the New Zealand river network were predicted using the random forest technique. Furthermore, the winter to summer BFI for all river reaches in New Zealand were also determined. Distinct spatial patterns of the BFI were identified. While the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the BFI was determined by a combination of factors, certain patterns can be attributed to geological formations in New Zealand, namely the volcanic plateau region and the Southern Alps. While the dataset determined in this work can support work specifically pertaining to water resources planning and management in New Zealand, in particular water supply, stream ecology and pollution risk, the methodology devised to calculate the BFI for gauged sites and to predict the BFI for ungauged sites is applicable to any region around the world.", "Modelling the long-term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond performance in an urban catchment ": "The influence of long-term suspended sediment dynamics on stormwater pond performance should not be ignored, but is often neglected in pond design and performance evaluation. This paper provides systematic simulated quantification of long-term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond performance. Integrated hydrological and two-dimensional hydro-morphodynamic modelling and simulations were carried over a 32-year period (1984\u20132015) covering 3896 rainfall events with a wide range of rainfall volumes, durations and intensities. Three event-based hypothetical rainfall scenarios: non-flood condition (5-year), sewer design condition (30-year), and river flood condition (100-year) rainfall events with 1-h duration, were also simulated for comparison between the traditional event-based approach and the novel approach presented in this study. Simulation results show that the flood peak attenuation and delay are more pronounced for small (<5-year) and medium (<30-year) flood events. The long-term continuous simulation results indicate that the pond provides positive annual trap efficiencies varying from 2% to 69% for 31 of 32\u202fyears, providing long-term water quality benefits downstream. However, an extreme rainfall event in year 2012 flush out the accumulated sedimentation as a shock load to the downstream river, leading to a negative trap efficiency of \u221211%. The spatially averaged sediment deposition rate, as predicted by the model, varies with a mean (SD) of 2 (1.34)\u202fcm/year over the study period, which resulted in a 24% loss in the pond\u2019s volume over 32\u202fyears. The impact of the loss in storage on pond flood attenuation capacity are explored at regular time intervals over the study period. The results indicate that reduction in the pond\u2019s flood attenuation capacity is relatively more pronounced for medium (30-year) and extreme (100-year) flood events than the frequent small flood (5-year) events. The variation in annual sediment loading with rainfall quantities and patterns are also explored.", "Long term changes in flooding and heavy rainfall associated with North Atlantic tropical cyclones: Roles of the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation ": "The aim of this study is to examine the contribution of North Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs) to flooding and heavy rainfall across the continental United States. Analyses highlight the spatial variability in these hazards, their temporal changes in terms of frequency and magnitude, and their connection to large-scale climate, in particular to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We use long-term stream and rain gage measurements, and our analyses are based on annual maxima (AMs) and peaks-over-threshold (POTs). TCs contribute to \u223c20\u201330% of AMs and POTs over Florida and coastal areas of the eastern United States, and the contribution decreases as we move inland. We do not detect statistically significant trends in the magnitude or frequency of TC floods. Regarding the role of climate, NAO and ENSO do not play a large role in controlling the frequency and magnitude of TC flooding. The connection between heavy rainfall and TCs is comparable to what observed in terms of flooding. Unlike flooding, NAO plays a significant role in TC-related extreme rainfall along the U.S. East Coast, while ENSO is most strongly linked to the TC precipitation in Texas.", "A review of drought concepts ": "Summary\n               \n                  Owing to the rise in water demand and looming climate change, recent years have witnessed much focus on global drought scenarios. As a natural hazard, drought is best characterized by multiple climatological and hydrological parameters. An understanding of the relationships between these two sets of parameters is necessary to develop measures for mitigating the impacts of droughts. Beginning with a discussion of drought definitions, this paper attempts to provide a review of fundamental concepts of drought, classification of droughts, drought indices, historical droughts using paleoclimatic studies, and the relation between droughts and large scale climate indices. Conclusions are drawn where gaps exist and more research needs to be focussed.", "Hydrological drought severity explained by climate and catchment characteristics ": "Summary\n               \n                  Impacts of a drought are generally dependent on the severity of the hydrological drought event, which can be expressed by streamflow drought duration or deficit volume. For prediction and the selection of drought sensitive regions, it is crucial to know how streamflow drought severity relates to climate and catchment characteristics. In this study we investigated controls on drought severity based on a comprehensive Austrian dataset consisting of 44 catchments with long time series of hydrometeorological data (on average around 50year) and information on a large number of physiographic catchment characteristics. Drought analysis was performed with the variable threshold level method and various statistical tools were applied, i.e. bivariate correlation analysis, heatmaps, linear models based on multiple regression, varying slope models, and automatic stepwise regression. Results indicate that streamflow drought duration is primarily controlled by storage, quantified by the Base Flow Index or by a combination of catchment characteristics related to catchment storage and release, e.g. geology and land use. Additionally, the duration of dry spells in precipitation is important for streamflow drought duration. Hydrological drought deficit, however, is governed by average catchment wetness (represented by mean annual precipitation) and elevation (reflecting seasonal storage in the snow pack and glaciers). Our conclusion is that both drought duration and deficit are governed by a combination of climate and catchment control, but not in a similar way. Besides meteorological forcing, storage is important; storage in soils, aquifers, lakes, etc. influences drought duration and seasonal storage in snow and glaciers influences drought deficit. Consequently, the spatial variation of hydrological drought severity is highly dependent on terrestrial hydrological processes.", "Reservoir operations under climate change: Storage capacity options to mitigate risk ": "Observed changes in precipitation patterns, rising surface temperature, increases in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, widespread melting of ice, and reduced snow cover are some of the documented hydrologic changes associated with global climate change. Climate change is therefore expected to affect the water supply-demand balance in the Northeast United States and challenge existing water management strategies. The hydrological implications of future climate will affect the design capacity and operating characteristics of dams. The vulnerability of water resources systems to floods and droughts will increase, and the trade-offs between reservoir releases to maintain flood control storage, drought resilience, ecological flow, human water demand, and energy production should be reconsidered. We used a Neural Networks based General Reservoir Operation Scheme to estimate the implications of climate change for dams on a regional scale. This dynamic daily reservoir module automatically adapts to changes in climate and re-adjusts the operation of dams based on water storage level, timing, and magnitude of incoming flows. Our findings suggest that the importance of dams in providing water security in the region will increase. We create an indicator of the Effective Degree of Regulation (EDR) by dams on water resources and show that it is expected to increase, particularly during drier months of year, simply as a consequence of projected climate change. The results also indicate that increasing the size and number of dams, in addition to modifying their operations, may become necessary to offset the vulnerabilities of water resources systems to future climate uncertainties. This is the case even without considering the likely increase in future water demand, especially in the most densely populated regions of the Northeast.", "Implications of projected climate change for groundwater recharge in the western United States ": "Summary\n               \n                  Existing studies on the impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge are either global or basin/location-specific. The global studies lack the specificity to inform decision making, while the local studies do little to clarify potential changes over large regions (major river basins, states, or groups of states), a scale often important in the development of water policy. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater recharge across the western United States (west of 100\u00b0 longitude) is presented synthesizing existing studies and applying current knowledge of recharge processes and amounts. Eight representative aquifers located across the region were evaluated. For each aquifer published recharge budget components were converted into four standard recharge mechanisms: diffuse, focused, irrigation, and mountain-systems recharge. Future changes in individual recharge mechanisms and total recharge were then estimated for each aquifer. Model-based studies of projected climate-change effects on recharge were available and utilized for half of the aquifers. For the remainder, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation were logically propagated through each recharge mechanism producing qualitative estimates of direction of changes in recharge only (not magnitude). Several key patterns emerge from the analysis. First, the available estimates indicate average declines of 10\u201320% in total recharge across the southern aquifers, but with a wide range of uncertainty that includes no change. Second, the northern set of aquifers will likely incur little change to slight increases in total recharge. Third, mountain system recharge is expected to decline across much of the region due to decreased snowpack, with that impact lessening with higher elevation and latitude. Factors contributing the greatest uncertainty in the estimates include: (1) limited studies quantitatively coupling climate projections to recharge estimation methods using detailed, process-based numerical models; (2) a generally poor understanding of hydrologic flowpaths and processes in mountain systems; (3) difficulty predicting the response of focused recharge to potential changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events; and (4) unconstrained feedbacks between climate, irrigation practices, and recharge in highly developed aquifer systems.", "Problems with the application of hydrogeological science to regulation of Australian mining projects: Carmichael Mine and Doongmabulla Springs ": "Understanding and managing impacts from mining on groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) and other groundwater users requires development of defensible science supported by adequate field data. This usually leads to the creation of predictive models and analysis of the likely impacts of mining and their accompanying uncertainties. The identification, monitoring and management of impacts on GDEs are often a key component of mine approvals, which need to consider and attempt to minimise the risks that negative impacts may arise. Here we examine a case study where approval for a large mining project in Australia (Carmichael Coal Mine) was challenged in court on the basis that it may result in more extensive impacts on a GDE (Doongmabulla Springs) of high ecological and cultural significance than predicted by the proponent. We show that throughout the environmental assessment and approval process, significant data gaps and scientific uncertainties remained unresolved. Evidence shows that the assumed conceptual hydrogeological model for the springs could be incorrect, and that at least one alternative conceptualisation (that the springs are dependent on a deep fault) is consistent with the available field data. Assumptions made about changes to spring flow as a consequence of mine-induced drawdown also appear problematic, with significant implications for the spring-fed wetlands. Despite the large scale of the project, it appears that critical scientific data required to resolve uncertainties and construct robust models of the springs\u2019 relationship to the groundwater system were lacking at the time of approval, contributing to uncertainty and conflict. For this reason, we recommend changes to the approval process that would require a higher standard of scientific information to be collected and reviewed, particularly in relation to key environmental assets during the environmental impact assessment process in future projects.", "Megacities and rivers: Scalar mismatches between urban water management and river basin management ": "Due to rapid urbanization, population growth and economic drivers, megacities and metropolises around the world face increasing water challenges, such as water scarcity, degradation of water resources and water-related risks such as flooding. Climate change is expected to put additional stress on already strained metropolitan water management systems. Although there is considerable research on river basin management and on urban water management, there is hardly any on metropolitan water management. Similarly, as urban water generally emerges from and returns to river basins, it is surprising how little literature there is that explicitly connects these two spheres of governance. Hence this review paper addresses the: What does a review of the literature tell us about the overlap and reconciliation between the concepts of Integrated Water Resources/River Basin Management and Metropolitan/Urban Water Management, particularly in relation to megacities? Based on an extensive literature review, this paper concludes that the key differences between the two are in relation to their overarching framework, scope, inputs and outputs of water and in relation to dealing with extreme weather events. The literature review reveals how sustainable and integrated urban water management increasingly adopt principles and rhetoric from integrated water resource management, this has yet to translate into significant changing practices on the ground. Urban water management still often occurs independently of river basin issues. Achieving coherence between river basin management and sustainable/integrated urban water management is even more difficult in metropolises and megacities, because the latter consists of multiple political-administrative units. The article concludes that the scalar mismatch between river basin management and metropolitan/megacity water governance deserves much greater attention than it currently receives in the academic and policy debates.", "Mechanisms and applications of green infrastructure practices for stormwater control: A review ": "Green Infrastructure (GI) is considered to be an innovative stormwater management approach that offers numerous other environmental benefits including reduction in air pollution and climate change mitigation compared with conventional gray infrastructures, and it has been gradually accepted and used worldwide. This review mainly focuses on the hydrological aspect of GI and provides a summary of the knowledge about GI as a stormwater management alternative. In this review, we discuss the operating mechanisms of a few widely-used GIs in the aspect of stormwater management. We critically examine policies for promoting GI implementation in some countries, including the sponge city in China and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) in Australia, and review the effectiveness of GI on treating stormwater quantity in real world applications. In addition, we also used Bibliometrics to analyze the GI research trends and found GI has been popular in an increasing number of countries and regions, which China has the greatest future growth potential in GIs research. Moreover, many barriers impeding the further development of GI and strategies to overcome these barriers are also summarized. This review gathers knowledge from many sources to provide an overview of GI to better understand its mechanisms and applications, and to highlight the areas that require future study.", "Urban flood resilience \u2013 A multi-criteria index to integrate flood resilience into urban planning ": "Climate change and increasing urbanization pose huge challenges in managing urban planning for a sustainable future. Intense urbanization resulting in the so-called mega cites aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow routes. Statistics show that flood disasters are one of the most significant in terms of damages and losses. Urbanization rates are increasing rapidly and it is important to learn how to live with floods by alleviating their consequences, in the present and future. This concern points to the resilience concept. By including the concept of resilience in flood risk analysis and decision-making, urban drainage design moves towards sustainable drainage systems. This study discusses resilience in the flood risk contextWe considered three main drivers to define a quantitative measure of flood resilience: the capability of a drainage system to resist and provide its service continuously over time; the capability of an urban area to recover from flood losses; and the capability of urban systems to evacuate floodwaters and return to a functional state. Consequently, this paper describes how flood resilience can be modeled and spatialized by a multi-criteria index called Spatialized Urban Flood Resilience Index (S-FRESI). The S-FRESI composition (according to the resilience definition adopted) combines: the hazard characteristics and the system exposure and susceptibility, to represent flood resistance mapped over time; the ability for material recovery from losses caused by inundation, considering the income variable; and the functional capacity of the drainage system, represented by the flood duration. S-FRESI can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience attained by different flood control measures, as well as in future scenarios of population growth, uncontrolled urbanization or climate change. The index was tested with coherent and consistent results in the Dona Eug\u00eania river catchment in Rio de Janeiro. Four different scenarios were formulated: (1) the current situation; (2) the current situation considering the implementation of sustainable flood control measures; (3) a future situation with the same infrastructure as today; and (4) a future situation with the considered flood control measures.", "Assessing the impact of urbanization on storm runoff in a peri-urban catchment using historical change in impervious cover ": "Summary\n               \n                  This paper investigates changes in storm runoff resulting from the transformation of previously rural landscapes into peri-urban areas. Two adjacent catchments (\u223c5km2) located within the town of Swindon in the United Kingdom were monitored during 2011 and 2012 providing continuous records of rainfall, runoff and actual evaporation. One catchment is highly urbanized and the other is a recently developed peri-urban area containing two distinct areas of drainage: one with mixed natural and storm drainage pathways, the other entirely storm drainage. Comparison of observed storm hydrographs showed that the degree of area serviced by storm drainage was a stronger determinant of storm runoff response than either impervious area or development type and that little distinction in hydrological response exists between urban and peri-urban developments of similar impervious cover when no significant hydraulic alteration is present. Historical levels of urbanization and impervious cover were mapped from the 1960s to the 2010s based on digitized historical topographic maps and were combined with a hydrological model to enable backcasting of the present day storm runoff response to that of the catchments in their earlier states. Results from the peri-urban catchment showed an increase in impervious cover from 11% in the 1960s to 44% in 2010s, and introduction of a large-scale storm drainage system in the early 2000s, was accompanied by a 50% reduction in the Muskingum routing parameter k, reducing the characteristic flood duration by over 50% while increasing peak flow by over 400%. Comparisons with changes in storm runoff response in the more urban area suggest that the relative increase in peak flows and reduction in flood duration and response time of a catchment is greatest at low levels of urbanization and that the introduction of storm water conveyance systems significantly increases the flashiness of storm runoff above that attributed to impervious area alone.\n                  This study demonstrates that careful consideration is required when using impervious cover data within hydrological models and when designing flood mitigation measures, particularly in peri-urban areas where a widespread loss in pervious surfaces and alteration of drainage pathways can significantly alter the storm runoff response. Recommendations include utilizing more refined urban land use typologies that can better represent physical alteration of hydrological pathways.", "Experimental modelling of urban flooding: A review ": "We review the 45 available studies of urban flooding based on laboratory experiments. We distinguish between the studies focusing on the flow in (i) a single street intersection, (ii) surface-sewer exchanges, (iii) an array of obstacles and (iv) quasi-realistic urban districts. We discuss the main flow processes which are covered in the various studies and detail which flow variables were recorded. This enables identifying flow processes for which comprehensive experimental datasets are available from those which require additional experimental research. We also highlight the typical ranges of scale factors used, which depend mainly on the extent of the studied area (from very local up to the district level). This review aims at helping computational modellers to pinpoint the most suitable dataset for validating their numerical approaches and laboratory modellers to identify gaps in current experimental knowledge of urban flooding.", "Decomposition of the mean squared error and NSE performance criteria: Implications for improving hydrological modelling ": "Summary\n               \n                  The mean squared error (MSE) and the related normalization, the Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), are the two criteria most widely used for calibration and evaluation of hydrological models with observed data. Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.", "Water diplomacy: The intersect of science, policy and practice ": "Why water diplomacy? What does diplomacy have to do with water? Is cooperation over transboundary surface and ground waters the exclusive domain of diplomats and foreign policy experts? Or mainly the purview of water professionals negotiating agreements on shared water resources? Why should non-governmental stakeholders be involved in transboundary water dialogues? These questions lie at the heart of debates and dialogues around the theory and practice of water diplomacy.\n                  The main aim of this Special Issue is to elaborate the intersect of science, policy, and practice and discuss ways knowledge can be distributed more equally and bridged across these spheres. In this editorial article, we summarize key messages on water diplomacy brought forward by authors in this Special Issue. We have identified the trends below as a possible future direction on water diplomacy research as well as issues that need to be addressed in the policy debate. One of the overarching themes is how to ensure that available technical knowledge informs the political tracks of water diplomacy and how to build trust effectively to ensure sustainability of water cooperation processes.", "Bias correction of regional climate model simulations for hydrological climate-change impact studies: Review and evaluation of different methods ": "Summary\n               \n                  Despite the increasing use of regional climate model (RCM) simulations in hydrological climate-change impact studies, their application is challenging due to the risk of considerable biases. To deal with these biases, several bias correction methods have been developed recently, ranging from simple scaling to rather sophisticated approaches. This paper provides a review of available bias correction methods and demonstrates how they can be used to correct for deviations in an ensemble of 11 different RCM-simulated temperature and precipitation series. The performance of all methods was assessed in several ways: At first, differently corrected RCM data was compared to observed climate data. The second evaluation was based on the combined influence of corrected RCM-simulated temperature and precipitation on hydrological simulations of monthly mean streamflow as well as spring and autumn flood peaks for five catchments in Sweden under current (1961\u20131990) climate conditions. Finally, the impact on hydrological simulations based on projected future (2021\u20132050) climate conditions was compared for the different bias correction methods. Improvement of uncorrected RCM climate variables was achieved with all bias correction approaches. While all methods were able to correct the mean values, there were clear differences in their ability to correct other statistical properties such as standard deviation or percentiles. Simulated streamflow characteristics were sensitive to the quality of driving input data: Simulations driven with bias-corrected RCM variables fitted observed values better than simulations forced with uncorrected RCM climate variables and had more narrow variability bounds.", "A comparative study of available water in the major river basins of the world ": "Numerous large river basins of the world have few and irregular observations of the components of the terrestrial hydrological cycle with the exception of stream gauges at a few locations and at the outlet along with sparsely distributed rain gauges. Using observations from satellite sensors and output from global land surface models, it is possible to study these under-observed river basins. With populations greater than a billion people, some of these rivers (e.g., the Ganga-Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, the Nile and the Mekong) are the economic engines of the countries they transect, yet thorough assessment of their flow dynamics and variability in regard to water resource management is still lacking. In this paper, we use soil moisture (0\u20132\u202fm) and surface runoff from the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), evapotranspiration, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and total water storage anomaly from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to examine variability of individual water balance components. To this end, understanding the inter-annual and intra-seasonal variability and the spatial variability of the water balance components in the major river basins of the world will help to plan for improved management of water resources for the future.", "Water conflict management and cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan ": "Managing water resource systems usually involves conflicts. Water recognizes no borders, defining the global geopolitics of water conflicts, cooperation, negotiations, management, and resource development. Negotiations to develop mechanisms for two or more states to share an international watercourse involve complex networks of natural, social and political system (Islam and Susskind, 2013). The Kabul River Basin presents unique circumstances for developing joint agreements for its utilization, rendering moot unproductive discussions of the rights of upstream and downstream states based on principles of absolute territorial sovereignty or absolute territorial integrity (McCaffrey, 2007). This paper analyses the different stages of water conflict transformation between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It first examines historical disputes between the upstream and downstream riparians, revolving around contending rights claims, resulting in zero-sum confrontations with one party\u2019s loss as another\u2019s gain, possibly ending in confrontation. The paper then formulates a decision support tool, a mechanism for transforming conflict into cooperation, and concludes by introducing practical methods for identifying basin needs and sharing benefits, enabling riparians to negotiate a win-win process.", "Advances in water resources research in the Upper Blue Nile basin and the way forward: A review ": "The Upper Blue Nile basin is considered as the lifeline for \u223c250 million people and contributes \u223c50\u202fGm3/year of water to the Nile River. Poor land management practices in the Ethiopian highlands have caused a significant amount of soil erosion, thereby threatening the productivity of the Ethiopian agricultural system, degrading the health of the aquatic ecosystem, and shortening the life of downstream reservoirs. The Upper Blue Nile basin, because of limited research and availability of data, has been considered as the \u201cgreat unknown.\u201d In the recent past, however, more research has been published. Nonetheless, there is no state-of-the-art review that presents research achievements, gaps and future directions. Hence, this paper aims to bridge this gap by reviewing the advances in water resources research in the basin while highlighting research needs and future directions. We report that there have been several research projects that try to understand the biogeochemical processes by collecting information on runoff, groundwater recharge, sediment transport, and tracers. Different types of hydrological models have been applied. Most of the earlier research used simple conceptual and statistical approaches for trend analysis and water balance estimations, mainly using rainfall and evapotranspiration data. More recent research has been using advanced semi-physically/physically based distributed hydrological models using high-resolution temporal and spatial data for diverse applications. We identified several research gaps and provided recommendations to address them. While we have witnessed advances in water resources research in the basin, we also foresee opportunities for further advancement. Incorporating the research findings into policy and practice will significantly benefit the development and transformation agenda of the Ethiopian government.", "Evidence for intensification of the global water cycle: Review and synthesis ": "One of the more important questions in hydrology is: if the climate warms in the future, will there be an intensification of the water cycle and, if so, the nature of that intensification? There is considerable interest in this question because an intensification of the water cycle may lead to changes in water-resource availability, an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms, floods, and droughts, and an amplification of warming through the water vapor feedback. Empirical evidence for ongoing intensification of the water cycle would provide additional support for the theoretical framework that links intensification with warming. This paper briefly reviews the current state of science regarding historical trends in hydrologic variables, including precipitation, runoff, tropospheric water vapor, soil moisture, glacier mass balance, evaporation, evapotranspiration, and growing season length. Data are often incomplete in spatial and temporal domains and regional analyses are variable and sometimes contradictory; however, the weight of evidence indicates an ongoing intensification of the water cycle. In contrast to these trends, the empirical evidence to date does not consistently support an increase in the frequency or intensity of tropical storms and floods.", "River flow forecasting through conceptual models part I \u2014 A discussion of principles ": "The principles governing the application of the conceptual model technique to river flow forecasting are discussed. The necessity for a systematic approach to the development and testing of the model is explained and some preliminary ideas suggested.", "Basin-scale hydrology and sediment dynamics of the Kosi river in the Himalayan foreland ": "Hydrological and sediment transport characteristics for the Kosi basin, which covers parts of Nepal and India, were analysed to understand the spatiotemporal variability of the hydrology and sediment dynamics of the Kosi basin and its implications for flood hazard and sediment dynamics. The study revealed that \u223c56% of the discharge at Chatara (where all major tributaries of the Kosi meet) is contributed from the western part of the basin even though this constitutes only 34% of the total basin area. In contrast, the central and eastern parts of the basin constitute 57% and 8% of the basin area but contribute \u223c38% and \u223c16% of the discharge at Chatara, respectively. The contribution of sediment load at Chatara from the different tributaries of the Kosi River also shows a similar pattern. Of a total of \u223c100 million tonnes of the annual sediment load at Chatara, \u223c56% is transported from four tributaries: the Indrawati, Bhote Kosi, Tama Kosi (all draining from the west), and Tamor. The remaining \u223c44% is transported by other tributaries upstream of Chatara, the most important being the Arun, Dudh Kosi, and Sun Kosi. Sediment budgeting in this study, based on annual sediment load data, suggested that \u223c20 million tonnes of sediments are deposited between Chatara and Birpur annually. This study also found that \u223c53 million tonnes of sediments are being accommodated between Birpur and Baltara annually. Sediment dynamics in the Kosi basin emerges as the most important river management issue, and this is closely linked to channel instability and frequent flooding in the alluvial plains.", "Assessing the effectiveness of drywells as tools for stormwater management and aquifer recharge and their groundwater contamination potential ": "Summary\n               \n                  Drywells are gravity-fed, excavated pits with perforated casings used to facilitate stormwater infiltration and groundwater recharge in areas where drainage and diversion of storm flows is problematic. Historically, drywells have predominantly been used as a form of stormwater management in locations that receive high volumes of precipitation; however the use of drywells is increasingly being evaluated as a method to supplement groundwater recharge, especially in areas facing severe drought. Studies have shown that drywells can be an effective means to increase recharge to aquifers; however, the potential for groundwater contamination caused by polluted stormwater runoff bypassing transport through surface soil and near surface sediment has prevented more widespread use of drywells as a recharge mechanism. Numerous studies have shown that groundwater and drinking water contamination from drywells can be avoided if drywells are used in appropriate locations and properly maintained. The effectiveness of drywells for aquifer recharge depends on the hydrogeologic setting and land use surrounding a site, as well as influent stormwater quantity and quality. These parameters may be informed for a specific drywell site through geologic and hydrologic characterization and adequate monitoring of stormwater and groundwater quality.", "A-type granites and related rocks: Petrogenesis and classification ": "The problems of identification of A-type granitoids are analyzed. These rocks occur in different geodynamic settings. Owing to their mantle nature, they show distinct REE specialization. These are acid intrusive rocks, whose volcanic products are of crucial scientific and practical significance. However, neither the great number of proposed classification schemes and diagrams, including those based on expensive analytical data, nor hot scientific discussions of their identification and the ambiguity of the term A-granitoids helped to determine their classification features in full measure. A principally new discriminant diagram is proposed for the classification of igneous A-type rocks, based on the analysis of earlier obtained results and the petrochemical composition of these rocks. A comparative analysis of subdivision of granites and related felsic volcanic rocks (SiO2\n                     >67wt.%), based on the ternary (Na2O+K2O)\u2013Fe2O3*\u00d75\u2013(CaO+MgO)\u00d75 and other widely applied diagrams, has shown the advantage of the proposed discriminant diagram for the classification of A-type granitoids from different geodynamic settings.", "The age and tectonic setting of the Lukinda dunite-gabbro-anorthosite massif in the east of the Selenga-Stanovoi superterrane, Central Asian Fold Belt ": "Results of integrated 40Ar/39Ar, Rb-Sr, and Sm-Nd geochronological studies of the Lukinda dunite-troctolite-gabbro-anorthosite massif in the northeast of the Selenga-Stanovoi superterrane, Central Asian Fold Belt, are presented. It is shown that this massif is much younger than formerly thought: 249 \u00b1 14 to 251 \u00b1 15 Ma vs. Paleoproterozoic. This date of magmatism corresponds to one of the stages of the formation of the Selenga-Vitim belt, which ranks among the largest Phanerozoic volcanoplutonic belts in Central Asia.", "Geochemical features and genesis of continental cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts ": "Mass cobalt-rich ferromanganese microcrusts and nodules similar in morphology and chemical composition to cobalt-rich ferromanganese deep-ocean crusts were found in Cenozoic volcanic rocks in southern Primorye. Research has shown that ore genesis of this type is genetically related to argillization and destruction of siliceous rocks by CO2-rich fluids, which is confirmed by experimental data on carbon erosion of iron-containing materials. Two types of this fluid ore genesis are recognized: (1) relatively high-temperature (vapor-condensate), related to late volcanic processes and fracture gas infiltration, and (2) low-temperature (vapor-liquid-condensate), controlled by degassing followed by carbon mobilization (gasification). Primarily colloidal ferromanganese segregations have high contents of Co, Ni, Pb, Cu, and Ce, typical of oceanic ore genesis. Regardless of the concentrations of these metals in the protoliths, their contents in microcrusts are similar (n-10n wt.%). This indicates the same ore genesis mechanism and similar sorption properties of the colloidal ferromanganese material formed. Barium- and cerium-rich ferromanganese microcrusts and nodules are abundant. Condensed drops of iron-containing platinum were found in apobasaltic nickel-rich ferromanganese segregations. There is a cerium paradox expressed as a minimum or a total lack of cerium among rare-earth phosphates associated with ferromanganese microcrusts. Fluid destruction and oxide metallization of ocean-floor basalts are assumed to be the main source of metals for oceanic ferromanganese crusts and nodules.", "\n               Forward and inverse self-potential modeling: a new approach\n             ": "Software has been designed for forward and inverse modeling of natural self-potential (SP) fields which allows simulating the geoelectric patterns simultaneously for up to 29 sheet-like and prismatic electrostatically polarized conductors. The cross sections for a number of ore fields obtained by inversion with the new SPI-SV code (self-potential inversion, Siberian version) have been corroborated by later drilling and are consistent with reference geologic sections used in algorithm testing. SPI-SV simulation can provide high-quality assessment of mineral deposits and, furthermore, allows approaching global-scale investigation into the natural self potential of crust and mantle.", "Quantitative analysis of the clay minerals in the Shurijeh Reservoir Formation using combined X-ray analytical techniques ": "The Shurijeh Reservoir Formation of Neocomian age is represented by a sandstone sequence, occasionally interbedded with shale, in the Gonbadli gas field, Kopet-Dagh Basin, Northeastern Iran. In this study X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques were used together to characterize the Shuirjeh clay minerals in 76 core samples collected from two deep Gonbadli wells. The results of XRF analysis showed high percentages of silicon and moderate to low percentages of aluminum, sulfur, calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, and iron in both wells. The XRD analysis indicated that the above elements were concentrated in the form of quartz, anhydrite, dolomite, calcite, plagioclase, K-feldspar, hematite, and clay minerals. Further XRD examination of the clay fraction revealed that illite, chlorite, and kaolinite were the major types of clay minerals. Unlike, glauconite, smectite, and a mixed layer clays of both the illite\u2013smectite and chlorite\u2013smectite types were observed only in very few samples. The percentages of individual clay minerals were determined using external standard calibration curves and successfully validated by a system of simultaneous linear equations acquired from detailed elemental information based on the XRF analysis. The error reached \u00b15% for the main mineral constituent and \u00b115% for minor minerals. A local regression relationship was also derived, based on the XRF elemental information, which can be used to estimate the clay contents of other Shurijeh drilled wells with data of pulsed-neutron spectroscopy tools. According to the proposed quantitative approach, the amount of illite varied considerably, reaching 18.3%. In contrast, the amounts of kaolinite and chlorite were generally small, i.e., less than 8.4%. The amount of total clay minerals changed greatly from a minimum of 5% to a maximum of 32.5%. An increase in illite with increasing burial depth and temperature was an obvious indication of deep burial diagenesis in this formation.", "Carbonatite metasomatism of peridotite lithospheric mantle: implications for diamond formation and carbonatite-kimberlite magmatism ": "Mineral inclusions in diamond record its origin at different depths, down to the lower mantle. However, most diamonds entrained with erupting kimberlite magma originate in lithospheric mantle. Lithospheric U-type diamonds crystallize during early metasomatism of reduced fO2 at the IW oxygen buffer) depleted peridotite in the roots of Precambrian cratons. Evidence of the metasomatic events comes from compositions of garnets in peridotitic xenoliths and inclusions in diamonds. On further interaction with carbonatitic melt, peridotite changes its composition, while diamond no longer forms in a more oxidized environment (fO2 near the CCO buffer). Silicate metasomatism of depleted peridotite (by basanite-like melts) does not induce diamond formation but may participate in generation of group I kimberlite. Low-degree (below 1%) partial melting of metasomatized peridotite produces a kimberlite-carbonatite magmatic assemblage, as in the case of the Snap Lake kimberlite dike. Occasionally, mantle metasomatism may occur as reduction reactions with carbonates and H2O giving rise to hydrocarbon compounds, though the origin of hydrocarbons in the deep mantle remains open to discussion. Melting experiments in carbonate systems show hydrous carbonated melts with low H2O to be the most plausible agents of mantle material transport. An experiment-based model implies melting of carbonates in subducting slabs within the mantle transition zone, leading to formation of carbonatitic diapirs, which can rise through the mantle by buoyancy according to the dissolution-precipitation mechanism. These processes, in turn, can form oxidized channels in the mantle and maintain diamond growth at the back of diapirs by reducing carbon from carbonated melts. When reaching the lithospheric base, such diapirs form a source of kimberlite and related magmas. The primary composition of kimberlite often approaches carbonatite with no more than 10-15% SiO2.", "Composition of the Earth\u2019s core: A review ": "This paper provides the state-of-the-art discussion of major aspects of the composition and evolution of the Earth\u2019s core. A comparison of experimentally-derived density of Fe with seismological data shows that the outer liquid core has a homogeneous structure and a ~10% density deficit, whereas the solid inner core has a complex heterogeneous anisotropic structure and a ~5% density deficit. Recent estimations of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and inner core boundary temperatures are equal to 3800\u20134200 K and 5200\u20135700 K, respectively. Si and O (up to 5\u20137 wt.%) are considered to be the most likely light element candidates in the liquid core. Cosmochemical estimates show that the core must contain about 2 wt.% S and new experimental data indicate that the inner core structure gives the best match to the properties of Fe carbides. Our best estimate of the Earth\u2019s core calls for 5\u20136 wt.% Si, 0.5-1.0 wt.% O, 1.8-1.9 wt.% S, and 2.0 wt.% C, with the Fe7C3 carbide being the dominant phase in the inner core. The study of short-lived isotope systems shows that the core could have formed early in the Earth\u2019s history within about 30\u201350 Myr after the formation of the Solar System, t0 = 4567.2 \u00b1 0.5 Ma. Studies on the partitioning of siderophile elements between liquid iron and silicate melt suggest that the core material would be formed in a magma ocean at ~1000-1500 km depths and 3000\u20134000 K. The oxygen fugacity for the magma ocean is estimated to vary from 4\u20135 to 1\u20132 log units below the Iron-Wustite oxygen buffer. However, the data for Mo, W, and S suggest addition of a late veneer of 10-15% of oxidized chondritic material as a result of the Moon-forming giant impact. Thermal and energetics core models agree with the estimate of a mean CMB heat flow of 7\u201317 TW. The excess heat is transported out of the core via two large low shear velocity zones at the base of superplumes. These zones may not be stable in their positions over geologic time and could move according to cycles of mantle plume and plate tectonics. The CMB heat fluxes are controlled either by high heat production from the core or subduction of cold slabs, but in both cases are closely linked with surface geodynamic processes and plate tectonic motions. Considerable amounts of exchange may have occurred between the core and mantle early in the Earth\u2019s history even up to the formation of a basal magma ocean. However, the extent of material exchange across the CMB upon cooling of the mantle was no greater than 1-2% of the core\u2019s mass, which, however, was sufficient to supply thermochemical plumes with volatiles H, C, and S.", "A section of Vendian in the east of West Siberian Plate (based on data from the Borehole Vostok 3) ": "The Borehole Vostok 3 drilled in the east of the West Siberian Plate (Tomsk Region) revealed a Vendian section in the depth range 5002\u20133870 m, which was subdivided into the Poiga, Kotodzha, and Raiga Formations based on geological, geophysical, and paleontological data. In the Kotodzha and Raiga Formations, typical Upper Vendian fossils of Cloudina hartmanae and Namacalathus sp. were found along with diverse Platysolenites, which are commonly considered to be of zonal significance in Lower Cambrian strata. Hence, the stratigraphic interval with abundant diverse Platysolenites has a wider stratigraphic range than it was believed earlier and seems to cover the Upper Vendian and Lower Cambrian deposits. The Borehole Vostok 3 is the first Siberian occurrence of the fossils Namacalathus, the world's fourth occurrence of the Cloudina-Namacalathus association, and the first site where coexisting Platysolenites and typical Vendian organisms have been found. Therefore, the borehole provides one of the most informative (in paleontological context) Upper Vendian sections.", "\n               A-type granites and related rocks: Petrogenesis and classification ": "The problems of identification of A-type granitoids are analyzed.

To understand the economic Ni-Cu deposit potential of the intrusions in central Mongolia, the parental magma affinity and sulfide saturation of the Oortsog, Dulaan, and Nomgon Ni-Cu mineralized mafic-ultramafic intrusions are studied. These three intrusions are predominantly gabbroic in composition, while the Oortsog and Dulaan intrusions also contain small proportions of peridotites. The parental magmas of the Oortsog and Dulaan intrusions are tholeiitic, as indicated by their Cr-spinel and clinopyroxene compositions, whereas the parental magma of the Nomgon intrusions is likely calc-alkaline. The compositions of Cr-spinel and clinopyroxene, combined with the presence of significant Nb-Ta depletions, indicate that these rocks were most likely derived from modified mantle sources. Both the Oortsog and Nomgon intrusions form two clusters in terms of their olivine composition, suggesting that multiple magma surges were involved during their emplacement. The relatively low Fo values and Ni contents in olivine from the three intrusions compared to those from Ni-Cu deposits in NW China, as well as those in the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit in Canada, indicate that the three intrusions were crystallized from relatively evolved magmas. The Cu/Zr ratios of rocks of the Oortsog, Dulaan, and Nomgon intrusions are higher than 1, suggesting that these rocks contain cumulus sulfide. This, coupled with the presence of rounded sulfide inclusions in olivine of the Oortsog and Dulaan intrusions, suggests that sulfide saturation occurred before or during olivine crystallization. The distribution patterns of platinum group elements (PGEs) of the Dulaan and Oortsog intrusions record slight Rh, Pt, and Pd (PPGE) enrichment relative to Os, Ir, and Rh (IPGE). Furthermore, the Ni/Cu ratios of sulfide-bearing rocks from the Oortsog intrusion vary from 1.8 to 3.8, which are consistent with those of the Ni-Cu sulfide deposits in NW China. In contrast, the Ni/Cu ratios of sulfide-bearing rocks from the Nomgon intrusion are extremely low (0.03 to 0.07). This, together with the significant enrichment in PPGE relative to IPGE, suggests that these sulfides of the Nomgon intrusion were segregated from a magma that was extremely enriched in Cu and PPGE but depleted in Ni and IPGE. The characteristics of the chalcophile elements in these intrusions are attributed to the fact that the derivation of the Nomgon magma was significantly different from that of the Dulaan and Oortsog parental magmas. Overall, although the parental magmas of the intrusions in central Mongolia are more evolved than those in NW China, they are comparable in terms of the sizes of their intrusions, constituent minerals, and mineral chemistry. These similarities suggest that the intrusions in central Mongolia have economic Ni-Cu sulfide potential. Furthermore, intrusions similar to the Nomgon intrusion may feature PGE mineralization potential.", "Jurassic and Cretaceous biostratigraphy and organic matter geochemistry of the New Siberian Islands (Russian Arctic)\n             ": "The Jurassic-Cretaceous terrigenous complex of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas is of considerable interest as a potential exploration target. However, the key Jurassic and Cretaceous sections of the New Siberian Islands have been poorly studied. The results of this study were used to provide a detailed micropaleontological description of these sections and substantiation of the previous lithostratigraphic subdivision. We first identified a series of Boreal standard zones in the Jurassic and Cretaceous sections, based on the foraminifers, ostracods, dinocysts, and terrestrial palynomorphs. Our results, along with the published data on ammonites, bivalves, and terrestrial palynomorphs and the results of radiometric dating, provide more precise constraints on the stratigraphic position of the identified lithostratigraphic units. The results of this study can be corroborated by seismic data to explore offshore areas of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas.

The research was performed in an area of Quaternary clay deposits with a resistivity of 20-50 Ohmm. For an OKO-2 GPR antenna with a center frequency of 150 MHz, the sounding depth is 2-4 m, whereas UWB sounding provides penetration of the GPR pulse to a depth of 30-40 m. Deep UWB sounding of low-resistivity environments is possible under the following conditions: use of generators based on drift step recovery diodes (DSRDs), high matching of the UWB receiving and transmitting antennas to the environment, and an increase in the noise immunity of the recording system, in particular, due to a decrease in the intensity of air waves.", "Continental crust in the Lomonosov Ridge, Mendeleev Ridge, and the Makarov basin. The formation of deep-water basins in the Neogene ": "The northeast of the Russian Arctic is a deep-water basin underlain by the Lomonosov and Mendeleev Ridges, with the Makarov basin in between. In most of this area, the water depth is ~1\u20134 km and the crust is thick (20\u201330 km), with a well-pronounced granitic layer. Therefore, some researchers regard this crust as continental. Others think that this is the oceanic crust, the same as that on the hotspots like Iceland in the Atlantic or Ontong Java in the Pacific. After their activity stops, such structures must subside as a result of the crust and mantle cooling, in the same way as the oceanic crust on a spreading axis. As regards the Lomonosov and Mendeleev Ridges, they subsided in quite a different way. In the absence of volcanism, they remained near sea level, almost not subsiding, for a long time (at least 70 and 190 myr, respectively). Since the late Early Miocene, these areas subsided rapidly and deep-water sediments overlay shallow-water ones. In the same epoch, the Makarov basin subsided rapidly, which also used to lie near sea level. Its subsidence was several times that which could have taken place over the same period of time as a result of lithosphere cooling on an extinct hotspot. Such tectonic movements were possible only for the continental crust. The data on the structure of the sedimentary cover preclude considerable lithospheric stretching in these areas. Therefore, the rapid subsidence is accounted for by the transformation of gabbro in the lower crust into denser rocks (garnet granulites and eclogites), catalyzed by infiltration of a mantle-derived fluid flows. Dense, deeply metamorphosed mafic rocks with a thickness of up to 10\u201320 km and P-wave velocities of ~8 km/s underlie the Moho in the area under study.", "Paleomagnetism of the Late Paleozoic granites of the Angara-Vitim batholith and the host rocks of the Baikal-Patom folded area: Tectonic implications ": "The paper presents the results of paleomagnetic and geochronological studies of the Late Paleozoic granites of the Angara-Vitim batholith as well as Vendian-Early Cambrian sedimentary rocks and Late Devonian subvolcanic rocks of the Patom margin of the Siberian Platform. Primary and metachronous magnetization in the rocks of the study region was used to calculate an Early Permian (~290Ma) paleomagnetic pole, which is proposed as a reference pole for the Siberian Platform in paleomagnetic reconstructions, plotting of the apparent polar-wander path curve, and other magnetotectonic studies. The published and obtained paleomagnetic data and analysis of the geological data confirm the Late Paleozoic age of the final folding in the Baikal-Patom area. Possible causes of Late Paleozoic deformations and large-scale granite formation in the Baikal-Patom area and Transbaikalia in the Late Paleozoic are discussed.", "Zonation of the Siberian Ordovician deposits based on pelagic groups of fauna ": "We summarize data on the biostratigraphic units of the Siberian Ordovician deposits based on pelagic groups of fauna: graptolites, conodonts, and chitinozoans. It is shown that graptolite and conodont zones and beds have a high potential for correlation. We have determined the precise zonal position of most of the lower boundaries of the Ordovician stages and informal Ordovician substages of the International Stratigraphic Chart in the Lower Paleozoic key sections of the Taimyr Peninsula, Siberian Platform, and Altai-Sayan Folded Area.", "Magmatism and metallogeny of the Early Earth as a reflection of its geologic evolution ": "The paper is focused on the evolution of the Earth starting with the planetary accretion and differentiation of the primordial material (similar in composition to CI chondrites) into the core and mantle and the formation of the Moon as a result of the impact of the Earth with a smaller cosmic body. The features of the Hadean eon (ca. 4500\u20134000 Ma) are described in detail. Frequent meteorite-asteroid bombardments which the Earth experienced in the Hadean could have caused the generation of mafic/ultramafic primary magmas. These magmas also differentiated to produce some granitic magmas, from which zircons crystallized. The repeated meteorite bombardments destroyed the protocrust, which submerged into the mantle to remelt, leaving refractory zircons, indicators of the Early Earth\u2019s geologic conditions, behind.\n                  The mantle convection that started in the Archean could possibly be responsible for the Earth\u2019s subsequent endogenous evolution. Long-living deep-seated mantle plumes could have promoted the generation of basalt-komatiitic crust, which, thickening, could have submerged into the mantle as a result of sagduction, where it remelted. Partial melting of the thick crust, leaving eclogite as a residue, could have yielded tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) melts. TTG rocks are believed to compose the Earth\u2019s protocrust. Banded iron bodies, the only mineral deposits of that time, were produced in the oceans that covered the Earth.\n                  This environment, recognized as LID tectonics combined with plume tectonics, probably existed on the Earth prior to the transitional period, which was marked by a series of new geologic processes and led to a modern-style tectonics, involving plate tectonics and plume tectonics mechanisms, by 2 Ga. The transitional period was likely to be initiated at about 3.4 Ga, with the segregation of outer and inner cores, which terminated by 3.1 Ga. Other rocks series (calc-alkaline volcanic and intrusive) rather than TTGs were produced at that time. Beginning from 3.4-3.3 Ga, mineral deposits became more diverse; noble and siderophile metal occurrences were predominant among ore deposits. Carbonatites, hosting rare-metal mineralization, could have formed only by 2.0 Ga. From 3.1 to 2.7 Ga, there was a period of \u201csmall-plate\u201d tectonics and first subduction and spreading processes, which resulted in the first supercontinent by 2.7 Ga. Its amalgamation indicates the start of superplume-supercontinent cycles.\n                  Between 2.7 and 2.0 Ga, the D\u2033 layer formed at the core-mantle interface. It became a kind of thermal regulator for the ascending already tholeiitic mantle plume magmas. All deep-seated layers of the Earth and large low-velocity shear provinces, called mantle hot fields, partially melted enriched EM-I and EM-II mantles, and the depleted recent asthenosphere mantle, which is parental for midocean-ridge basalts, were finally generated by 2 Ga. Therefore, an interaction of all Earth\u2019s layers began from that time.", "Interaction of crustal and mantle materials, sources of trace elements during the formation and evolution of Early Paleozoic Li-rich granite-pegmatite systems in southeastern Tuva ": "We present new data on the age, composition, and environments of formation of granites of the Kystarys complex and the associated Li-rich rare-element pegmatites of the South Sangilen pegmatite belt including the large Tastyg lithium deposit. It has been established that they formed during the Early Paleozoic collisional orogeny in the Tuva-Mongolian massif at the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary. The granites of the Kystarys complex are moderately alkaline high-K rocks and are enriched in Zr, Nb, Y, and REE; therefore, they are classified as postcollisional, transitional to within-plate (A-type). The spodumene pegmatites of the South Sangilen pegmatite belt are similar to the above granites in age and isotopic and geochemical parameters, which suggests a paragenetic relationship between these rocks. Pegmatites form several pegmatite fields within the belt, which differ in trace-element signatures. In addition to predominant Li, Cs, and Ta, specific to all spodumene pegmatites (LCT family), pegmatites of two fields have high contents of Nb, Y, REE, and Zr, which are indicator elements of NYF family pegmatites. It has been established that the formation of spodumene pegmatites with combined LCT-NYF geochemical signatures was preceded by the intrusion of dikes of monzogabbro with the geochemical characteristics of OIB and of alkali aegirine granites and by the formation of associated metasomatites enriched in Zr, Nb, Y, and REE. Based on the geological, mineralogical, and geochemical data, we substantiate the hypothesis of the formation of Li-bearing granite-pegmatite melts from a mixed source resulted from the influence of fluids of an alkaline igneous complex of mantle genesis on the crustal protolith.", "Late Paleozoic gabbroids of western Transbaikalia: U-Pb and Ar-Ar isotopic ages, composition, and petrogenesis ": "We provide new isotope-geochronological evidence for the synchronous occurrence of Late Paleozoic basic and granitoid magmatism in western Transbaikalia; this is a strong argument for the contribution of mantle magmas to granitoid petrogenesis. The Late Paleozoic basic rocks originated from the phlogopite-garnet-bearing lherzolitic mantle, which melted under \u201chydration conditions.\u201d The specific features of Late Paleozoic magmatism in western Transbaikalia were determined by the combination of the activity of a low-energy mantle plume with the final stage of the Hercynian orogeny in space and time. At the early stage of magmatism, during the formation of the Barguzin granites,the plume had only a thermal influence on the crustal rocks heated as a result of Hercynian fold-thrust deformations. The mixing of mantle basic and crustal salic magmas at different levels marked the transition from crustal to mixed (mantle-crustal) granites, which include all post-Barguzin complexes (probably, except for alkali granites). In the geologic evolution of Transbaikalia, the Late Paleozoic magmatism was postorogenic, but it was initiated and influenced by the mantle plume.", "Boninites and ophiolites: Problems of their relations and petrogenesis of boninites ": "There are four main types of boninites in ophiolite suites, which either spatially coexist with ophiolites though belong to other tectonic units (1), or are present as later constituents of ophiolite sequences (crosscutting dikes or lavas on top) (2), or build ophiolite sequences together with island-arc tholeiites and basaltic andesites, followed by younger volcanics of MORB or BABB affinites (3), or occupy the whole mafic portion of ophiolite sequences, together with island-arc tholeiites and basaltic andesites (4). The latter type, considered in more detail for the case of ophiolites from the southeastern Sayan Mountains (Siberia, Russia), presents an example of inconsistency between the model of ophiolite formation in mid-ocean ridge settings and subduction-related island-arc fingerprints in ophiolitic mafic rocks. The patterns of boninites record several evolution models of oceanic systems, with melting and intrusion of boninites in forearc, arc, and back-arc settings. The existing models are controversial, possibly, because there is no single mechanism to account for all types of boninites.", "Genesis of scapolite from granulites (lower-crustal xenoliths from the Pamir diatremes): results of study of melt inclusions ": "The results of mineralogical and thermobarogeochemical studies of lower-crustal xenolith of scapolite-bearing granulites from the fergusite-porphyry diatremes pipes in Southeastern Pamir (Tajikistan) are presented. All minerals (including garnet, clinopyroxene, and scapolite) of these granulites contain primary melt inclusions, which were studied using thermometric and microprobe methods (EPMA, SIMS, Raman spectroscopy). We have established that their compositions correspond to acid (from rhyodacites to rhyolites), essentially potassic melts of normal and high alkalinity with H2O \u2264 4 wt.%, Cl \u2264 0.8 wt.%, and CO2 ~ 1 wt.%. The melts are depleted in HREE and have high Th/U ratios (7.7\u20139.4). Study of melt inclusions using mineralogical thermobarometers showed that the scapolite-bearing granulite crystallized at ~1000 \u00b0C and ~15 kbar. This rock resulted, most likely, from the incongruent melting of carbonate-bearing biotite-quartz-plagioclase substrate in the lower crust, which was accompanied by the crystallization of garnet, clinopyroxene, sphene, plagioclase, and scapolite trapping microportions of acid melts as inclusions. The minerals crystallized not from melt but in its presence. High-Ca scapolite (Me67\u201369) crystallized instead of plagioclase when the melts reached high contents of CO2 (~1 wt.%) and Cl (\u22640.8 wt.%) in the presence of CO2-rich fluid.", "Barite mineralization in the Deryugin Basin of the Okhotsk Sea: Active processes and formation conditions ": "The paper reports on seafloor terrains mapped to a high resolution, the structure of shallow-water sediments, and the extent of barite mineralization in the Deryugin Basin, Okhotsk Sea. The data were collected by different methods of remote sounding of the bottom and a Comanche submersible in the area of the Barite Ridge deposit. The sedimentary cover, including Holocene sediments, is strongly deformed in this area and in some other areas of the basin. Several small mud volcanoes and new barite build-ups along the ridge axis are evidence of active fluid venting. Precipitated barite forms columns (chimneys) or grows over older layered barite build-ups. The research confirms the hypothesis of Ba supply by deep cold hydrotherms.", "Kinematic reconstruction of the Early Caledonian accretion in the southwest of the Siberian paleocontinent based on paleomagnetic results ": "The kinematics of the Early Caledonian accretion process in the southwest (in modern coordinate) of the Siberian paleocontinent, and the structure of its active continental margin are debatable subjects. This paper contains a generalization of paleomagnetic data on island-arc terranes of the territories of the Altai\u2013Sayan and Baikal\u2013Vitim folded areas for the Late Vendian/Cambrian\u2013Early Ordovician time interval, obtained mostly with the author\u2019s participation during the last two decades. The large accumulated database finally allows one to find unambiguously interpretable patterns in the distribution of paleomagnetic poles for the analyzed terrane system and to justify numerically the kinematics of the Early Caledonian accretion. In particular, the analysis of paleomagnetic data proves our idea stating that the transformation of the active continental margin in the Cambrian consisted in its breakup and segmentation as well as in the detachment of fragments of the initially whole island arc along a system of sinistral strike-slips during the clockwise rotation of the craton and conform drift of the continental and oceanic lithospheric plates. It also validates the mostly oblique conditions of the subduction and subsequent accretion, which means a subduction-transform mode on the ocean\u2013continent margin. We propose a complemented version of the paleotectonic reconstruction for the Cambrian evolution of the Siberian continent western margin, based on the kinematic scheme constructed from paleomagnetic data.", "The western part of the West Siberian petroleum megabasin: geologic history and structure of the basement ": "On the basis of complex research into the western part of the West Siberian Plate, a new scheme of the structure-formation zones of its basement has been developed and a new geological map of its pre-Jurassic basement has been compiled. Ophiolites and other mafic-ultramafic complexes (fragments of the oceanic Earth's crust) were studied. The most complete Late Ordovician ophiolite complex comprising a melange of serpentinites, gabbroids, plagiogranites, and basalt with jasper interbeds lies in the Shaim area. Weakly altered spinel lherzolites were also examined there. The research has revealed not only Ordovician but also Devonian basalts as well as gabbroid complexes (392 Ma, Sm-Nd dating). The Paleozoic geodynamic history of the region was terminated with collision, which was accompanied by tectonic piling and the intrusion of granite plutons, metamorphism, and formation of new continental crust. These crucial events, which consolidated Paleozoic complexes throughout the vast area of the future West Siberian megabasin, date from the Early Permian. The composition, age, and nature of granitoid plutons in western West Siberia were studied, and isochrons and isotope characteristics were obtained, which give an insight into both the genesis and age of granite plutons and their subsequent transformations.", "The role of water in the deep upper mantle and transition zone: dehydration of stagnant slabs and its effects on the big mantle wedge ": "Mineral physics data related to the deep dehydration of stagnant slabs are summarized. The hydrogen diffusion in minerals of the mantle transition zone is not fast enough to homogenize the transition zone on the geological time scale, and hydrogen is expected to be unevenly distributed there. The hydrous fluid formed in the transition zone tends to percolate into shallower depths to form gravitationally stable hydrous magmas at the base of the upper mantle. We need further studies on the relation of intraplate volcanism above the stagnant slab and deep dehydration, because we expect the geochemical fingerprints of deep dehydration to be quite different from those of shallow dehydration from the subducting slabs.", "Cyber security challenges for IoT-based smart grid networks ": "The energy needs of the 21st century are growing rapidly due to the population growth and considerable efforts are being made to make the electricity grid more intelligent in order to make it more responsive to the energy needs of the consumers and to provide improved efficiency and reliability of power systems. Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as one of the enabling technologies for a smart grid network. As the IoT connected devices continue to grow at a rapid pace, one of the major challenges is security since the devices are online hence making the smart grid vulnerable to significant attacks. Since an IoT based smart grid would consist of potentially millions of nodes, it has the largest attack surface for an IoT focused cyber-attack. A cyber-attack on a smart grid would have devastating effects on reliability of widespread infrastructure given the potential cascade effects of shutting down the electricity grid since most of the devices in our homes, offices, hospitals and trains require electricity to run. Once a single device is compromised, then the whole grid becomes vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such attacks on electricity supply can grind entire cities to a halt thereby causing huge financial and economic losses. This makes security a critical factor to consider before large scale deployment of IoT based smart grid networks.\n                  In this paper we review and explore the major challenges and security issues stunting the growth of IoT-based smart grid networks.", "The insider threat: Behavioral indicators and factors influencing likelihood of intervention ": "The insider threat is a significant security concern for Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) organizations. A successful insider act in one of the CNI sectors has potential to damage assets and interrupt the critical services that society depends upon. Existing research suggests that behavioral indicators are often evident prior to an act taking place, but that reporting of such behaviors does not usually happen. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence employees\u2019 intention to intervene when observing behavioral changes associated with insider acts. An online survey with employees within a large Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) energy sector organization (N\u202f=\u202f55) explored factors including behavioral change type, relationship to the actor, employment status of the actor and actor motivations. Results supported existing research regarding reluctance to report behavioral indicators of attitude change, but also demonstrated that situations with sufficient evidence are more likely to be reported. Factors which inhibited intervention likelihood were relative seniority and perceived motivations of the actor, confidence of confidentiality and clarity of reporting processes. Primary barriers to intervention related to the observer's perceived ability to correctly interpret behavioral indicators and awareness of how to respond. Organizations need to provide training regarding behavioral indictors of insider threats, clear, confidential reporting processes, and a culture where respectful challenge is encouraged.", "Complex approach to assessing resilience of critical infrastructure elements ": "The resilience of elements in a critical infrastructure system is a major factor determining the reliability of services and commodities provided by the critical infrastructure system to society. Resilience can be viewed as a quality which reduces the vulnerability of an element, absorbs the effects of disruptive events, enhances the element's ability to respond and recover, and facilitates its adaptation to disruptive events similar to those encountered in the past. In this respect, resilience assessment plays an important role in ensuring the security and reliability of not only these elements alone, but also of the system as a whole. The paper introduces the CIERA methodology designed for Critical Infrastructure Elements Resilience Assessment. The principle of this method is the statistical assessment of the level of resilience of critical infrastructure elements, involving a complex evaluation of their robustness, their ability to recover functionality after the occurrence of a disruptive event and their capacity to adapt to previous disruptive events. The complex approach thus includes both the assessment of technical and organizational resilience, as well as the identification of weak points in order to strengthen resilience. An example of the application of the CIERA method is presented in the form of a case study focused on assessing the resilience of a selected element of electrical energy infrastructure.", "\u201cInternet of Smart Cards\u201d: A pocket attacks scenario ": "Smart cards are secure devices used to store people sensitive data and to regulate important operations like identity proofs and payment transactions. For years people have been used to contact smart cards but in the last decade we have seen the massive introduction of contactless smart cards. At the same time we have seen a growing number of mobile phones equipped with a NFC interface in circulation, which are capable of interacting with contactless smart cards.\n                  Under different circumstances the user\u2019s contactless cards and mobile phone are kept close together at a distance that should enable them to interact each other, for instance in pockets and bags. We describe an architecture to attack the contactless cards of a user through his NFC-equipped mobile phone. The user\u2019s mobile phone, here defined as smart-mole, is infected and connected to the NFC-equipped one of the attacker, the proxy. The victim\u2019s phone capabilities are exploited to run local attacks against a contactless card in its range, for instance to recover the card PIN that is then sent back to the attacker. Subsequently the attacker remotely uses the victim\u2019s card through a relay attack putting his phone in front of a reader and providing the PIN of the victim card when needed, basically impersonating the cardholder. Infecting several phones an attacker could have under his control a large set of cards, a sort of \u201cInternet of Smart Cards\u201d.\n                  We show that surveying a decade of research and development in the contactless cards field such attacks look feasible according the current social context and the level of technology. We also discuss how they could be methodologically applied by an attacker to defeat the different measures currently adopted to secure contactless cards.", "A survey of cyber security management in industrial control systems ": "Contemporary industrial control systems no longer operate in isolation, but use other networks (e.g., corporate networks and the Internet) to facilitate and improve business processes. The consequence of this development is the increased exposure to cyber threats. This paper surveys the latest methodologies and research for measuring and managing this risk. A dearth of industrial-control-system-specific security metrics has been identified as a barrier to implementing these methodologies. Consequently, an agenda for future research on industrial control system security metrics is outlined. The \u201cfunctional assurance\u201d concept is also introduced to deal with fail-safe and fail-secure industrial control system operations.", "Regulated applications for the road transportation infrastructure: The case study of the smart tachograph in the European Union ": "The Digital Tachograph (DT) is an equipment intended for installation in road commercial vehicles to display, record, print, store and output automatically or semi-automatically details of the vehicle movement and details of certain periods of activity of the drivers. It is used in the European Union to check the driving times of drivers and enforce the legislation on social rules (rest period, driving time limits), in relation with the road safety objective of reducing the number of accidents and fatalities in the EU. Each driver is equipped with a personal card (s)he has to introduce in the tachograph to be personally identified. The DT is a very important application in Europe in the road transportation sector as it is obligatory to install a DT in commercial vehicles having a mass of more than 3,5 tonnes (in goods transport) and carrying more than 9 persons including the driver (in passenger transport). Thus this regulation impacts millions of vehicles. The legal and technical framework has been recently revised according to Council Regulation (EU) No. 165/2014, which introduced support for wireless communication, positioning by Global Positioning Satellite Systems (GNSS) and new security measures for the DT system. This led to the revision of the existing DT technical specifications to a new set of specifications discussed with law enforcers, manufacturers and service providers. The new technical specifications are hundreds of pages long and they cover many different technical aspects. The goal of this paper is to describe the key elements of the new design of the smart tachograph and how it addresses the limitations of the existing DT.", "Implementation of security and privacy in ePassports and the extended access control infrastructure ": "Several researchers have analyzed the security characteristics and weaknesses of electronic passports (machine readable travel documents) introduced by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in its Document 9303. However, little, if any, work has focused on the public key infrastructures necessary to manage the certificates that underpin the security measures. This paper discusses the key aspects related to the management of keys and certificates to implement security and privacy measures for machine readable travel documents issued by European Union member states. In particular, the paper concentrates on extended access control and the associated Single Point of Contact (SPOC) protocol.", "PLC memory attack detection and response in a clean water supply system ": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are frequently used in manufacturing and critical infrastructures like water treatment, chemical plants, and transportation schemes. Citizens tend to take modern-day conveniences such as trains, planes or tap water for granted without considering the critical systems involved for their operations. Interrupting these industries could lead to disastrous consequences, leading to financial losses or even costing human lives. For that reason, researchers have been actively investigating the threats targeting ICS. In this paper, the authors propose a mechanism of attack detection and mitigation for attacks focusing on the input memory of Programming Logic Controllers (PLCs). To help investigate this concept, a testbed that models a clean water supply system was built using components and technologies currently used in the industry. The mechanism supporting attack detection and response for the input memory is implemented within the PLC itself as part of its programming. The mechanism of response involves three different techniques: optimised datablocks, switching between control strategies and obtaining the sensor readings directly from its analogue channel. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach along with the effectiveness of each response mechanism.", "A framework for modeling and assessing system resilience using a Bayesian network: A case study of an interdependent electrical infrastructure system ": "This research utilizes Bayesian network to address a range of possible risks to the electrical power system and its interdependent networks (EIN) and offers possible options to mitigate the consequences of a disruption. The interdependent electrical infrastructure system in Washington, D.C. is used as a case study to quantify the resilience using the Bayesian network. Quantification of resilience is further analyzed based on different types of analysis such as forward propagation, backward propagation, sensitivity analysis, and information theory. The general insight drawn from these analyses indicate that reliability, backup power source, and resource restoration are the prime factors contributed towards enhancing the resilience of an interdependent electrical infrastructure system.", "Analyzing the critical risk factors associated with oil and gas pipeline projects in Iraq ": "Although Oil and Gas Pipelines (OGPs) are a safe and economical mode of transportation of petroleum products around the world, they face challenges caused by risk factors. These include safety, security, design, construction and operational risks due to Third Party Disruption (TPD) and acts of terrorism, particularly in developing and unstable countries like Iraq. A lack of knowledge about managing such risks and the scarcity of past data about pipeline failures are hindering OGP risk management systems. This paper, therefore, focuses on identifying and analyzing the risks caused by TDP in order to develop a holistic Risk Management Model (RMM). A semi-structured questionnaire was designed, using 30 risk factors identified through a comprehensive literature review, distributed to OGP stakeholders in Iraq, via an online survey tool, to collect the research data. SPSS was used to analyze the data and evaluate risk factors which were ranked in order of likelihood and severity level using a risk index method. A conceptual framework for the RMM is presented, based on the literature review and survey findings. The results reveal that terrorism, sabotage, oleum product transportation, however and theft are the most critical safety risks, official corruption and lawlessness the most influential factors for regulatory risks. Pipeline location \u201cHot-Zones\u201d also have a serious impact on the failure of pipelines. A computer-based risk management model will be developed at the next stage of the study using the RMM and the results of the numerical risk analysis.", "On PLC network security ": "Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is an important component in modern Industrial Control Systems (ICS) particular in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Disturbing the normal operation of PLCs can lead to significant damages ranging from minor annoyance to large scale incidents threatening the life of people. While most of existing work in the SCADA security literature focuses on the communication between PLCs and field devices, this paper presents a network security analysis of the communication between PLCs and the engineering stations in charge of setting up and configuring them. Interestingly, this aspect of SCADA security was exploited by the most famous SCADA attack, namely, Stuxnet. Using a testbed with a common PLC device, we successfully carried out three network attacks leading to serious compromise of typical PLCs.", "Time-based critical infrastructure dependency analysis for large-scale and cross-sectoral failures ": "Dependency analysis of critical infrastructures is a computationally intensive problem when dealing with large-scale, cross-sectoral, cascading and common-cause failures. The problem intensifies when attempting a dynamic, time-based dependency analysis. This paper extends a previous graph-based risk analysis methodology to dynamically assess the evolution of cascading failures over time. Various growth models are employed to capture slow, linear and rapidly evolving effects, but instead of using static projections, the evolution of each dependency is \u201cobjectified\u201d by a fuzzy system that also considers the effects of nearby dependencies. To achieve this, the impact (and, eventually, risk) of each dependency is quantified on the time axis into a form of many-valued logic. In addition, the methodology is extended to analyze major failures triggered by concurrent common-cause cascading events. A critical infrastructure dependency analysis tool, CIDA, that implements the extended risk-based methodology is described. CIDA is designed to assist decision makers in proactively analyzing dynamic and complex dependency risk paths in two ways: (i) identifying potentially underestimated low risk dependencies and reclassifying them to a higher risk category before they are realized; and (ii) simulating the effectiveness of alternative mitigation controls with different reaction times. Thus, the CIDA tool can be used to evaluate alternative defense strategies for complex, large-scale and multi-sectoral dependency scenarios and to assess their resilience in a cost-effective manner.", "Extending the cyber-attack landscape for SCADA-based critical infrastructure ": "The move from point-to-point serial communication to traditional information technology (IT) networks has created new challenges in providing cyber-security for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in critical infrastructure. Current research on the attack landscape for critical infrastructure concentrates on either IT-based or protocol specific attacks. However, there is limited research focus on \u201cthe bigger picture\u201d, the combination of IT attacks and critical infrastructure protocol attacks, and little consideration of cyber-attacks targeting an entire (SCADA)-based critical infrastructure system. Due to such narrow research, there is a complete lack of focus when comprehending full-scale cyber attacks on SCADA-based critical infrastructure systems. As a result, new attacks combining various vulnerabilities in engineering systems and IT systems are yet to be discovered.\n                  In this paper, we collated existing known attacks, identified and combined the existing range of attack landscapes, expanded and \u201cfilled the gaps\u201d in the landscape, thus presenting a complete cyber-attack framework that perceives attacks against entire SCADA-based critical infrastructure. Our framework identifies four attack types, traditional IT-based attacks, protocol specific attacks, configuration-based attacks and control process attacks, allowing us to describe practical attacks. The benefit of recognizing the range of attacks on entire critical systems is that it allows us to defend against attacks with far greater efficiency and intelligence. To support the validity of our presented framework, we present a case study demonstrating a series of attacks on physical Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) critical infrastructure equipment.", "Quality function deployment-based framework for improving the resilience of critical infrastructure systems ": "Critical infrastructure systems (CISs), increasingly suffering from various hazards in recent decades, are in urgent need of improving their resilience. So far few approaches for CISs resilience improvement have recognized that different resilience improvement efforts could have synergetic or conflicting correlations between them. There lack systemic approaches for transforming resilience improvement requirements into coordinated and implementable measures. To address this gap, the current study proposes a quality function deployment (QFD)-based framework for strengthening the resilience of CISs. The proposed framework involves different stages of the CISs lifecycle, and takes into consideration the correlations between resilience improvement efforts at these stages. It can transform resilience criteria into system properties, component characteristics, implementation processes and controlling factors successively, which is facilitated with a series of houses of quality (HoQs). Using a case study of electric power system, we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed framework with detailed explanations of the design and implementation of the first HoQ. The results of the case study showed that the proposed framework could identify the trade-offs between resilience improvement efforts at different stages of the CISs lifecycle, and take into account their relationships with resilience criteria and the correlations among them to work out optimized solutions for improved CISs resilience.", "Critical infrastructure protection: Requirements and challenges for the 21st century ": "Critical infrastructures play a vital role in supporting modern society. The reliability, performance, continuous operation, safety, maintenance and protection of critical infrastructures are national priorities for countries around the world. This paper explores the vulnerabilities and threats facing modern critical infrastructures with special emphasis on industrial control systems, and describes a number of protection measures. The paper also discusses some of the challenging areas related to critical infrastructure protection such as governance and security management, secure network architectures, self-healing, modeling and simulation, wide-area situational awareness, forensics and learning, and trust management and privacy.", "The challenge of detecting false documents at the border: Exploring the performance of humans, machines and their interaction ": "The verification of a travel document authenticity is the cornerstone of border checks. Because of pressures at the border (time constraints and increasing numbers of travellers to check) and the growing complexity of modern document security, border control capabilities (officers and/or automated systems) are tasked to rapidly and straightforwardly decide on whether the documents presented are genuine or false. Although operational performance of document inspection capabilities is of paramount importance for the effectiveness and security of border checks, the topic is rarely discussed and studied. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the development of a methodology to assess the operational performance of document inspection capabilities (human and technical) by reporting on the findings of the Document Challenge II, the second exercise of this sort performed in Lisbon in September 2013 and organized by Frontex in cooperation with the Portuguese Servico de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF), the UK National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU), the Dutch Royal Marechaussee and the German Forensic Institute of the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA).", "Cyber attack detection and mitigation: Software Defined Survivable Industrial Control Systems ": "Modern Industrial Control Systems (ICS) constitute complex and heterogeneous \u2018system of systems\u2019 embracing the numerous advantages of traditional Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The pervasive integration of off-the-shelf ICT into the core of ICS broadened the palette of features and applications, but it also raised new design challenges and exposed ICS to a new breed of cyber-physical attacks. In addition, despite all the security solutions in place, unavoidably, these systems may be compromised. Therefore, survivability, that is, the ability to face malicious actions and faults, becomes a salient feature/requirement in the design of modern cyber-connected ICS. We present a comprehensive solution for ensuring the survival of ICS under malicious activities and faults. We design a Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) based communication infrastructure particularly tailored to address the communication requirements of ICS. We develop an attack detection and localization algorithm for bidirectional ICS flows, and we design an optimal intervention strategy that embraces the communication and security requirements of industrial applications. Finally, we present intrinsic details on recreating a real-life and emulated test infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the solution\u2019s applicability to networked robot control systems.", "The economics of cybersecurity: Principles and policy options ": "Economics puts the challenges facing cybersecurity into perspective better than a purely technical approach does. Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. For instance, companies operating critical infrastructures have integrated control systems with the Internet to reduce near-term, measurable costs while raising the risk of catastrophic failures, whose losses will be primarily borne by society. As long as anti-virus software is left to individuals to purchase and install, there may be a less than optimal level of protection when infected machines cause trouble for other machines rather than their owners. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability and increasing crime, policy and legislation must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. In this paper, we examine the economic challenges that plague cybersecurity: misaligned incentives, information asymmetries, and externalities. We then discuss the regulatory options that are available to overcome these barriers in the cybersecurity context: ex ante safety regulation, ex post liability, information disclosure, and indirect intermediary liability. Finally, we make several recommendations for policy changes to improve cybersecurity: mitigating malware infections via ISPs by subsidized cleanup, mandatory disclosure of fraud losses and security incidents, mandatory disclosure of control system incidents and intrusions, and aggregating reports of cyber espionage and providing them to the World Trade Organization (WTO).", "A stealth monitoring mechanism for cyber-physical systems ": "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are often used in several types of Essential Systems and Critical Infrastructures, depend on control devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers, Remote Terminal Units and Intelligent Electronic Devices. Such devices, which are deployed at the edge of the SCADA infrastructure, directly interface with the physical processes under control. They are often based on embedded systems with limited capabilities and exposed to significant security and safety-related risks, as demonstrated by past incidents such as Stuxnet. However, despite the recognized relevance of those edge devices, they usually lack monitoring mechanisms able to detect device anomalies and/or cyber-physical threats.\n                  In this paper we propose a novel approach for stealth monitoring of those control devices, for purposes of security and safety management. This approach builds on cost-effective probes, which we designate as Shadow Security Units (SSU), directly attached to the monitored control devices. This privileged positioning enables the direct and fine-grained observation of both physical inputs/outputs (i.e. the physical processes under control) and network communication flows \u2013 allowing the exploitation of various novel monitoring approaches able to address sophisticated security threats not noticeable otherwise. Moreover, the SSU approach is not limited to SCADA scenarios, being also applicable to similar domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Avionics and Self-Driving systems.", "Multi-criteria spatial decision support system for identifying strategic roads in disaster situations ": "A road transportation network has an important role in the management of disaster situations. Despite its' vulnerability to disasters, it helps to provide emergency responses to disaster management practices. Therefore it is required to identify the most important roads in the network in order to support decision-makers to make appropriate decisions about the roads.\n                  This paper introduces an integrated methodology to evaluate the transportation network performance (TNP) in disaster situations by developing a multi-criteria spatial decision support system (MC-SDSS). The developed MC-SDSS is a fully integrated system of Geospatial Information System (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. On the one hand, GIS functionalities are used for storing the data, performing the analyses in order to produce the required criteria and displaying the results. On the other hand, AHP as a well-known MCDM method is used to receive priorities and preferences of decision-makers about the criteria.\n                  Based on the decision-making model (intelligent, design, and choice), four criteria are selected as indicators for evaluating the TNP in disaster situations: capacity, accessibility, vulnerability, and importance criteria. In this regard, criteria maps are generated by GIS tools, the experts' preferences about the criteria are acquired by AHP comparison matrix, and a ranking of the roads are prepared and visualized on the MC-SDSS. Finally, by utilizing the One-At-Time approach as the sensitivity analysis method, MC-SDSS tries to determine the robustness of the results due to the variation or uncertainty resulting from changing the important scales of the criteria in the AHP pairwise comparison matrix.\n                  The results show that about 9, 33, 20, and 38% of the roads are very high, high, moderate, and low strategic in the case study (Mazandaran province, Iran) respectively. It also shows that capacity/accessibility pairwise comparison is the most sensitive comparison in the AHP comparison matrix.", "Quantitative evaluation of the synergistic effects of failures in a critical infrastructure system ": "A critical infrastructure is a complicated system whose failure (in whole or in part) has a significant impact on national interests, including security, the economy and basic human needs. The system consists of relevant sectors, elements and their mutual linkages. In order to study critical infrastructures, it is necessary to apply a systems approach based on cross-sectoral evaluation and research into the linkages between the individual critical infrastructure sectors. Specifically, it is necessary to describe the individual vertical and horizontal levels of each critical infrastructure and the associated linkages. From this point-of-view, a critical infrastructure is embedded within the broader context of emergencies and enterprises, representing a compact and mutually-interconnected system.\n                  This paper focuses on quantitatively assessing the impacts of critical infrastructure failures. It presents a theory of synergistic linkages, their levels and the synergistic effects due to the joint action of impacts, which increase the overall impact on the critical infrastructure and on society. The concepts are formalized in the SYNEFIA methodology, which is applied in a case study involving the critical infrastructure of the Czech Republic. In particular, the methodology is applied to determine the synergistic effects of disruptions to multiple sub-sectors of the Czech infrastructure.", "Nationwide critical infrastructure monitoring using a common operating picture framework ": "This paper describes the efforts involved in designing a common operating picture system for monitoring large-scale critical infrastructures. The design leverages the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion model to enable the integration of different critical infrastructure systems with their dependency relations. The resulting Situational Awareness of Critical Infrastructure and Networks (SACIN) framework offers a platform that provides a common operating picture of a critical infrastructure. A generic data collection component customized to each source system generates events and facilitates JDL level\u00a00 integration. An analysis component collects events and data to produce meaningful information about the current state and future impact estimates in accordance with JDL levels\u00a01 to\u00a03. A brokered architecture supports level\u00a04 control by various components and a JDL level\u00a05 user interface is offered via a web application. Interviews of infrastructure subject matter experts were conducted to obtain the situational awareness requirements. By applying key situational awareness oriented design principles to the situational awareness requirements, a user interface was created for organizing information based on operator situational awareness needs and supporting key cognitive mechanisms that transform data into high levels of situational awareness. Situational awareness measures were used to assess operator performance during critical infrastructure tasks \u2013 a \u201cfreeze-probe\u201d recall approach (Situational Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT)), a post-trial subjective rating approach (Situational Awareness Rating Technique (SART)) and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results indicate that the supply of attentional resources (SART supply) and overall SAGAT score best predict the performance levels of operators.", "Key pre-distribution scheme with join leave support for SCADA systems ": "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are used in major industries to achieve greater levels of efficiency, safety and quality. Due to massive security attacks, securing such systems is a critical issue. In order to secure the communications of SCADA systems, it is observed that key pre-distribution schemes are more suitable. In this paper, we propose a matrix- based key pre-distribution scheme for SCADA systems. The scheme supports device join, leave and key update operations with less communication cost. Also, the proposed key pre-distribution scheme supports secure broadcasting, multi-casting and unicast communications between the SCADA systems. In this novel approach, secret keys are not transmitted over the network to handle the operations, such as key update, join and leave. Alternatively, each device locally computes the required keys, once they are deployed in the network. However, in these situations that the device compromises or supports forward secrecy, the auxiliary and group keys are encrypted and sent to the required devices. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme from both performance and security perspectives, it is compared with existing schemes through simulation results and analyzing the findings.", "On the practical integration of anomaly detection techniques in industrial control applications ": "Despite significant advances made on anomaly detection systems, few reports are found documenting their practical integration into the industrial realm. Furthermore, the literature reports a wide range of complex detection strategies, which may require hardware changes/updates in order to be supported by critical industrial equipment such as industrial controllers (e.g., Programmable Logic Controllers). To address these issues, this paper documents a systematic methodology for the practical integration of lightweight anomaly detection algorithms into industrial control applications. It shows that industrial controllers, and in particular the scheduling rate of user programs, are sensitive to network traffic-based disturbances. Therefore, the methodology embraces the task scheduling rates found in control applications, and their deviation from the \u201cnormal\u201d behavior. It designs a \u201cmonitoring\u201d task, and an innovative algorithm for detecting abnormal task scheduling rates by leveraging the cumulative sum model (CUSUM) and a regression strategy applied on a specific time interval. Essentially, the approach enhances the industrial controller with a \u201csecurity module\u201d that can trigger alerts to identify early cyber attacks. The approach is extensively analyzed in the context of two industrial controllers: a Phoenix Contact ILC 350-PN controller, and a Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 Programmable controller.", "Interdependent Critical Infrastructure Model (ICIM): An agent-based model of power and water infrastructure ": "The comfort, mobility, and economic well-being of a population depends on reliable and affordable electric power services, which in turn requires a sustainable water supply. It is therefore increasingly important to analyze the sustainability and resilience of mid- and long-term electric utility and water system capacity expansion plans. Due to the inherent interdependency between power and water critical infrastructure, these expansion plans should be analyzed with respect to potential challenges posed by climate change and other risks. Decision-makers therefore require tools that facilitate an integrated analysis that captures the interdependency of power and water to better inform future expansion plans. Here we develop an agent-based model of a typical regional power system that incorporates the features of specific plant types and their cooling systems that are dependent on adequate water supplies at appropriate temperatures to support full power operation. The effects of capacity expansion plans, power demand growth, climate change, and extreme events are analyzed through different scenarios designed to illustrate the utility of such a model and show where it can aid in mid- and long-term planning.", "Characteristics and adsorption capacities of low-cost sorbents for wastewater treatment: A review ": "Low-cost by-products from agricultural, household and industrial sectors have been recognized as a sustainable solution for wastewater treatment. They allow achieving the removal of pollutants from wastewater and at same time to contribute to the waste minimization, recovery and reuse. Despite numerous reviews have been published in the last few years, a direct comparison of data obtained using different sorbents is difficult nowadays because of inconsistencies in the data presentation. In this context, the aim of the study was to revise the current literature concerning the application of low-cost adsorbents for wastewater treatment highlighting, systematically, both adsorbents characteristics and adsorption capacities. For this scope, low-cost sorbents have been divided into the following five groups: (i) Agricultural and household wastes, (ii) industrial by-products, (iii) sludge, (iv) sea materials, (v) soil and ore materials and (vi) novel low-cost adsorbents. The affinity of sorbents in removing various pollutants, their applications on real wastewater, costs and considerations on their reuse after adsorption processes, has been discussed. Finally, in order to better highlights the affinity of sorbents for more pollutants (dyes, heavy metals, biorecalcitrant compounds, nitrogen and phosphate compounds), simple methodological tools such as \u201cadsorbents-pollutants\u201d matrices have been proposed and applied. In this manner, the adsorbent candidates for replacing commercial activated carbons have been identified.", "The future of automotive lithium-ion battery recycling: Charting a sustainable course ": "This paper looks ahead, beyond the projected large-scale market penetration of vehicles containing advanced batteries, to the time when the spent batteries will be ready for final disposition. It describes a working system for recycling, using lead\u2013acid battery recycling as a model. Recycling of automotive lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is more complicated and not yet established because few end-of-life batteries will need recycling for another decade. There is thus the opportunity now to obviate some of the technical, economic, and institutional roadblocks that might arise. The paper considers what actions can be started now to avoid the impediments to recycling and ensure that economical and sustainable options are available at the end of the batteries' useful life.", "A review of unconventional sustainable building insulation materials ": "Building insulation is commonly realized using materials obtained from petrochemicals (mainly polystyrene) or from natural sources processed with high energy consumptions (glass and rock wools). These materials cause significant detrimental effects on the environment mainly due to the production stage, i.e. use of non-renewable materials and fossil energy consumption, and to the disposal stage, i.e. problems in reusing or recycling the products at the end of their lives. The introduction of the concept of \u201csustainability\u201d in building design process encouraged researches aimed at developing thermal and acoustic insulating materials using natural or recycled materials. Some of them, such as kenaf or wood fiber, are already commercialized but their diffusion could be further improved since their performance is similar to the synthetic ones. Others are currently under study and their development is only at an early stage. The goal of the paper is to report a state of the art of building insulation products made of natural or recycled materials that are not or scarcely commercialized. Comparative analyses were carried out considering in particular thermal characteristics in terms of thermal conductivity, specific heat and density. Data on the acoustic performance of the materials were also reported. Life Cycle Assessment data were finally collected, in order to put in evidence the environmental advantages of these materials. Particular attention was paid to researches focused to exploit local materials and even industrial byproducts, since these approaches respectively limit transportation and disposal impacts.", "Why nuclear energy is sustainable and has to be part of the energy mix ": "Humanity must face the reality that it cannot depend indefinitely on combustion of coal, gas and oil for most of its energy needs. In the unavoidable process of gradually replacing fossil fuels, many energy technologies may be considered and most will be deployed in specific applications. However, in the long term, we argue that nuclear fission technology is the only developed energy source that is capable of delivering the enormous quantities of energy that will be needed to run modern industrial societies safely, economically, reliably and in a sustainable way, both environmentally and as regards the available resource base. Consequently, nuclear fission has to play a major role in this necessary transformation of the 21st century energy-supply system.\n                  In a first phase of this necessary global energy transformation, the emphasis should be on converting the major part of the world's electrical energy generation capacity from fossil fuels to nuclear fission. This can realistically be achieved within a few decades, as has already been done in France during the 1970s and 1980s. Such an energy transformation would reduce the global emissions of carbon dioxide profoundly, as well as cutting other significant greenhouse gases like methane. Industrial nations should take the lead in this transition.\n                  Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, replacing coal-fired generating stations with gas-fired stations will not necessarily result in a reduction of the rate of greenhouse-gas emission even for relatively low leakage rates of the natural gas into the atmosphere.\n                  The energy sources popularly known as \u2018renewables\u2019 (such as wind and solar), will be hard pressed to supply the needed quantities of energy sustainably, economically and reliably. They are inherently intermittent, depending on backup power or on energy storage if they are to be used for delivery of base-load electrical energy to the grid. This backup power has to be flexible and is derived in most cases from combustion of fossil fuels (mainly natural gas). If used in this way, intermittent energy sources do not meet the requirements of sustainability, nor are they economically viable because they require redundant, under-utilized investment in capacity both for generation and for transmission.\n                  Intermittent energy installations, in conjunction with gas-fired backup power installations, will in many cases be found to have a combined rate of greenhouse-gas emission that is higher than that of stand-alone coal-fired generating stations of equal generating capacity. A grid connection fee, to be imposed on countries with a large intermittent generating capacity, should be considered for the purpose of compensating adjacent countries for the use of their interconnected electric grids as back-up power. Also, intermittent energy sources tend to negatively affect grid stability, especially as their market penetration rises.\n                  The alternative \u2014 dedicated energy storage for grid-connected intermittent energy sources (instead of backup power) \u2014 is in many cases not yet economically viable. However, intermittent sources plus storage may be economically competitive for local electricity supply in geographically isolated regions without access to a large electric grid. Yet nuclear fission energy will, even then, be required for the majority displacement of fossil fuels this century.", "Experimental study of concrete made with granite and iron powders as partial replacement of sand ": "Granite Powder (GP) and Iron Powder (IP) are industrial byproducts generated from the granite polishing and milling industry in powder form respectively. These byproducts are left largely unused and are hazardous materials to human health because they are airborne and can be easily inhaled. An experimental investigation has been carried out to explore the possibility of using the granite powder and iron powder as a partial replacement of sand in concrete. Twenty cubes and ten beams of concrete with GP and twenty cubes and ten beams of concrete with IP were prepared and tested. The percentages of GP and IP added to replace sand were 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of the sand by weight. It was observed that substitution of 10% of sand by weight with granite powder in concrete was the most effective in increasing the compressive and flexural strength compared to other ratios. The test resulted showed that for 10% ratio of GP in concrete, the increase in the compressive strength was about 30% compared to normal concrete. Similar results were also observed for the flexure. It was also observed that substitution of up to 20% of sand by weight with iron powder in concrete resulted in an increase in compressive and flexural strength of the concrete.", "Thermoelectric generators: Linking material properties and systems engineering for waste heat recovery applications ": "Waste-heat recovery with thermoelectric power generators can improve energy efficiency and provide distributed electricity generation. New thermoelectric materials and material performance improvements motivate development of thermoelectric generators for numerous applications with excess exhaust and process heat. However, thermoelectric generator product development requires solving coupled challenges in materials development and systems engineering. This review discusses these challenges and indicates ways system-level performance relies on more factors than traditional thermoelectric material performance metrics alone. Relevant thermo-mechanical and chemical material properties, system components such as thermal interface materials and heat exchangers, and system form factors are examined. Manufacturing processes and total system cost components are evaluated to provide product development and commercial feasibility contexts.", "Electric vehicle traction motors without rare earth magnets ": "Since the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) became main-stream with the launch of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the use of rare earth magnets in vehicle traction motors has become common. In particular the rare earth based, hard magnetic material Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) has offered significant performance benefits, not possible with other technologies, enabling the development of compact, torque- and power-dense electric traction motors. This trend has continued as mass market Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) such as the Nissan Leaf, have come to market. However in 2011\u20132012 the price of these materials rose significantly, owing to geopolitical concerns relating to security of supply. Whilst the price has recovered more recently closer to historical levels, concern still remains in the minds of governments and many manufacturers of hybrid and electric vehicles. Reports have also raised questions over the environmental sustainability of these materials and this has further encouraged users to consider alternatives. This paper therefore examines why these magnetic materials have been so successful in traction motor applications. It also explores the alternatives, including those which are ready for market and those which are in the process of being developed.", "Materials and membrane technologies for water and energy sustainability ": "Water and energy have always been crucial for the world's social and economic growth. Their supply and use must be sustainable. This review discusses opportunities for membrane technologies in water and energy sustainability by analyzing their potential applications and current status; providing emerging technologies and scrutinizing research and development challenges for membrane materials in this field.", "Lithium-ion battery recycling processes: Research towards a sustainable course ": "There is a need to develop technology to enable a resource-efficient and economically feasible recycling system for lithium-ion batteries and thus assure the future supply of the component materials. Lithium-ion batteries are complex products, and designs and materials are still evolving, which makes planning for future recovery more challenging. Several processes for recycling are proposed or operating, and each has advantages and disadvantages. This paper compares these processes on technical and economic bases, elucidating differences in benefits as a function of cathode composition. Since none of the existing processes is ideal, research areas are suggested that could enable development of improved recycling methods. The most promising research areas are separation technologies.", "Critical raw materials: A perspective from the materials science community ": "Functional materials are crucial to meet today's societal challenges and needs, such as the transition towards low carbon energy production to reduce climate change, renewable energies and green economy, clean mobility and improved communication. In order to fulfill specific functions, many of these materials require a variety of specific metallic elements whose total reserves in primary deposits on the planet are limited in quantity and unevenly distributed, respectively require significant efforts for exploration and investments in their exploitation. Furthermore, the extraction and processing of the corresponding metallic minerals can be sometimes related to a high environmental burden as well as frequently negative social impacts. While in contrast to fossil fuels mineral materials can be principally recycled and hence kept as resources, closing the materials loop especially for many specialty metals today is often hampered by dissipation as well as by physical and economic challenges. These metallic elements are also listed under \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d which have been receiving increased attention in scientific and policy-related debates over the last decade and years. In this paper, we introduce the topic of materials criticality for the special issue of Sustainable Materials and Technologies and observe how the criticality of raw materials is perceived and handled within Materials Science. For this, we (i) present examples of critical raw materials in advanced technologies, (ii) summarize some definitions of criticality, (iii) outline the topic of critical raw materials in the Material Scientist community by highlighting relevant outcomes of a survey on critical raw materials for materials scientists, and (iv) conduct a literature research on \u201cCritical Raw Materials\u201d and \u201cCriticality\u201d in search engines commonly used by materials scientists. The results show that material scientists seem frequently not concerned with the criticality of raw materials in their work, and that the relevant terms appear for a broader scientific community mainly in the fields of environmental science, chemistry-related processing and environmental and resource management. The paper presents and discusses these results and suggests to advance the implementation of the concept of materials criticality in materials research and development.", "Circular use of plastics-transformation of existing petrochemical clusters into thermochemical recycling plants with 100% plastics recovery ": "Plastics represent a serious waste-handling problem, with only 10% of the plastic waste (PW) generated world-wide being recycled. The remainder follows a linear economy model, involving disposal or incineration. Thermochemical recycling provides an opportunity to close the material cycle, and this work shows how this can be achieved using the existing petrochemical infrastructure. The transformation of a generic petrochemical cluster based on virgin fossil feedstocks into a cluster that is based on PW has the following proposed sequence: (1) the feedstock is partially replaced (45% on carbon basis) by PW; (2) the feedstock is totally replaced by PW; (3) the process undergoes electrification; and (4) oxy-combustion and carbon capture and storage are introduced to achieve 100% carbon recovery in the form of monomers or permanent storage. An alternative transformation pathway that includes the introduction of biomass is also considered. The energy and carbon balances of the proposed implementation steps are resolved, and cost estimates of the savings related to the feedstock and required investments are presented. The main conclusion drawn is that switching the feedstock from virgin fossil fuels to PW (Implementation steps 1 and 2) confers economic advantages. However, the subsequent transformation steps (Implementation steps 3 and 4) can only be justified if a value is assigned to the environmental benefits, e.g., CO2 savings, increased share of biogenic carbon in plastic products, increasing recycling quotas, and/or the potential of the process to compensate for the intermittency of renewable power. It is also discussed how utilisation of the diverse compositions of PW streams by additional processes can meet the other demands of a chemical cluster.", "Synthesis paradigm and applications of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), a review ": "Nanoscience is an inspiring and influential discipline of science which have accessible numerous novel and cost-effective yields and applications. Currently, nanotechnology research has been empowering more in agricultural sector, food process and medicinal industries. The surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles is quite large which have 1\u2013100nm size. Nanomaterials have superior bioavailability than larger particles, resulting in greater utilization in single cells, tissues and organs. Referable to the growing demand of nanoparticles, it is essential to build up synthetic method which is profitable, environmentally sustainable and which can substitutes with effective and competent technology to synthesis environmentally benign nanoparticles (NPs). Nanomaterials are \u201cdeliberately engineered\u201d to direct the enhancement of special properties at the nanoscale. Nanoparticles have been known to be used for abundant physical, biological, and pharmaceutical applications. Nano-silver is the most studied and utilized nanoparticle. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been the topics of researchers because of their unique properties. Thus, this review presents various synthesis methods of AgNPs and its application in different sectors.", "The case for recycling: Overview and challenges in the material supply chain for automotive li-ion batteries ": "Lithium ion batteries (LIB) continue to gain market share in response to the increasing demand for electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and energy storage. The increased demand for LIB has highlighted potential problems in the supply chain of raw materials needed for their manufacture. Some critical metals used in LIB, namely lithium, cobalt, and graphite are scarce, are not currently mined in large quantities, or are mined in only a few countries whose trade policies could limit availability and impact prices. The environmental and social impacts of mining these materials have also drawn attention as production ramps up to meet the increased demand. Closed-loop systems with recycling at the end-of-life provide a pathway to lower environmental impacts and a source of high value materials that can be used in producing new batteries. Because environmental regulations concerning end-of-life batteries are not fully developed or implemented, most of these batteries currently end up in the landfills, with a very small number of spent batteries sent to the existing recycling facilities. However, with proactive regulations, an increasing supply of spent batteries, and innovations in recycling technologies, end-of-life batteries could supply a significant fraction of the materials needed for manufacturing of new LIB. This paper reviews the current state of the LIB manufacturing supply chain, addresses some issues associated with battery end-of-life, and sheds light on the importance of LIB recycling from the environmental and value chain perspectives. We also discuss the expected benefits of recycling on the global LIB supply chain.", "Characterisation and properties of visible light-active bismuth oxide-titania composite photocatalysts ": "Bismuth oxide \u2013 titanium dioxide composite materials were produced by pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering onto two types of commercially available titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The use of an oscillating bowl enabled deposition of bismuth oxide uniformly onto loose powders, in contrast to solid substrates typically used for the conventional magnetron sputtering processes. Variation of the deposition time allowed the production of composite materials with different amounts of bismuth oxide. The composite materials, as well as uncoated titania powders, were extensively analysed by a range of analytical techniques, including SEM/EDX, XRD, BET, XPS, TEM and UV\u2013visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Photocatalytic properties of the materials were assessed under simulated visible light irradiation via degradation of acetone and methanol through measurements of carbon dioxide evolution. Additionally, the composite materials were characterised with a newly developed technique of reversed double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy in order to obtain information on the distribution of electron traps. Bismuth oxide was found in crystalline \u03b2-Bi2O3 form on both types of substrates without any additional heat treatment applied. Though the distribution of bismuth oxide on titanium dioxide was found to depend strongly on particle size and deposition time used, the composite materials exhibited significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity compared to either of the commercial titania materials used as a substrate.", "Recent advances in high energy-density cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries ": "Large-scale energy storage technologies are in great demands for the enhanced power grid efficiency and wide renewable energy source applications. Various electrochemical energy storage devices, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) et al. with long operating life and high energy conversion efficiency, have achieved rapid growth in the past 30\u202fyears, which make them the best choice for the large energy storage applications. Recently, SIBs have been proposed as the most promising solution for the large-scale energy storage systems because of the huge abundant and low cost of sodium resources. High energy-density cathode materials are now the main limits for high performance SIBs. Herein, the advances made in high energy-density cathodes for SIBs, together with the sodium storage mechanism; the remaining challenges and perspectives for high energy-density cathode materials, are discussed thoroughly based on recent researches and publications. Meanwhile, the achievement of material simulations in the design and development of cathode materials for SIBs, especially the high-throughput strategy and data science, is also introduced. This review is expected to accelerate the progress on SIB studies for high energy-density cathode materials, and more importantly, open up new opportunities for the high-energy cathode materials design in sodium storage.", "Mapping supply chain risk by network analysis of product platforms ": "Modern technology makes use of a variety of materials to allow for its proper functioning. To explore in detail the relationships connecting materials to the products that require them, we map supply chains for five product platforms (a cadmium telluride solar cell, a germanium solar cell, a turbine blade, a lead acid battery, and a hard drive (HD) magnet) using a data ontology that specifies the supply chain actors (nodes) and linkages (e.g., material exchange and contractual relationships) among them. We then propose a set of network indicators (product complexity, producer diversity, supply chain length, and potential bottlenecks) to assess the situation for each platform in the overall supply chain networks. Among the results of interest are the following: (1) the turbine blade displays a high product complexity, defined by the material linkages to the platform; (2) the germanium solar cell is produced by only a few manufacturers globally and requires more physical transformation steps than do the other project platforms; (3) including production quantity and sourcing countries in the assessment shows that a large portion of nodes of the supply chain of the hard-drive magnet are located in potentially unreliable countries. We conclude by discussing how the network analysis of supply chains could be combined with criticality and scenario analyses of abiotic raw materials to comprise a comprehensive picture of product platform risk.", "Aqueous solution discharge of cylindrical lithium-ion cells ": "The development of mass-market electric vehicles (EVs) using lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is helping to propel growth in LIB usage, but end-of-life strategies for LIBs are not well developed. An important aspect of waste LIB processing is the stabilisation of such high energy-density devices, and energy discharge is an obvious way to achieve this. Salt-water electrochemical discharge is often mentioned as the initial step in many LIB recycling studies, but the details of the process itself have not often been mentioned. This study presents systematic discharge characteristics of different saline and basic solutions using identical, fully charged LIB cells. A total of 26 different ionic solutes with sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and ammonium (NH4\n                     +) cations have been tested here using a fixed weight percentage concentration. An evaluation of possible reactions has also been carried out here. The results show good discharge for many of the salts, without significant damaging visual corrosion. The halide salts (Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212) show rapid corrosion of the positive terminal, as does sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3), and the solution penetrates the cell can. Mildly acidic solutions do not appear to cause significant damage to the cell can. The most alkaline solutions (NaOH and K3PO4) appear to penetrate the cell without any clear visual damage at the terminals. Depending on what is desired by the discharge (i.e. complete cell destruction and stabilisation or potential re-use or materials recovery), discharge of individual Li-ion cells using aqueous solutions holds clear promise for scaled-up and safe industrial processes.", "Research gaps in environmental life cycle assessments of lithium ion batteries for grid-scale stationary energy storage systems: End-of-life options and other issues ": "Although deployments of grid-scale stationary lithium ion battery energy storage systems are accelerating, the environmental impacts of this new infrastructure class are not well studied. To date, a small literature of environmental life cycle assessments (LCAs) and related studies has examined associated environmental impacts, but they rely on a variety of methods and system boundaries rather than a consistent approach. The large LCA literature of transportation applications of LIB contains selected life-cycle inventory data relevant for stationary ESSs, but does not incorporate characteristics unique to stationary systems, such as balance of system materials; operational profiles; and perhaps even different end-of-life (EOL) phase needs. This critical literature review surveys the existing studies on grid-scale stationary LIB ESS, and highlights research gaps concerning comprehensive environmental impacts. Further analysis specific to grid-connected LIB systems \u2013 encompassing use phase (battery operation) and EOL, in addition to production phase \u2013 is required for a robust assessment of environmental impacts of grid-connected energy storage in LIB systems. For example, thus far studies that systematically evaluate the consequential impact of storage system operation have been focused on energy arbitrage and frequency regulation applications. Future work should consider the impact of ESS providing other grid services as well. Although EOL costs and impacts for stationary LIB ESSs are an important consideration for prospective asset owners and key users of grid-scale ESS (such as electric utility companies and project developers), they are not yet addressed in the literature.", "Alkali-activated soapstone waste - Mechanical properties, durability, and economic prospects ": "Soapstone is a soft, magnesium-rich mineral widely used in the production of carved objects and architectural elements, for instance. The processing of soapstone causes the formation of significant amounts of waste powder, which is largely landfilled at the moment. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the suitability of soapstone waste as the main binder for the alkali-activation process using sodium silicate and hydroxide solutions as activators. The results demonstrate that soapstone alone reacts to some extent (compressive strength of 13\u202fMPa at 28\u202fday age), but mechanical properties are improved significantly after replacing 20% of soapstone by metakaolin (compressive strength of 31\u202fMPa at 28 d age). The obtained mechanical properties are closely similar to those of virgin soapstone. Durability properties of the developed alkali-activated binders were similar or better than typical Portland cement-based binders in terms of high temperature, acid, and freeze-thaw resistance, and sorptivity. The material costs alkali-activated soapstone mortar were estimated as approximately 70 \u20ac/t. Thus, the results enable utilizing currently underexploited soapstone waste in a sustainable and economically interesting way.", "Improving supply security of critical metals: Current developments and research in the EU ": "According to the reports on critical raw materials for the EU, a raw material is considered critical if it has a high economic importance to the EU combined with high supply risk. Supply risk is considered to arise from a combination of several factors, namely a high concentration of production in countries with poor governance, limited material substitutability, and poor end-of-life recycling rates. A number of industry activities, policy initiatives and research projects have recently been initiated in Europe with the aim to secure an adequate supply of raw materials. In this article, we review such ongoing developments with a focus on publicly funded research projects on critical metals in Europe, and discuss their contribution to reaching the objectives of the Raw Materials Initiative as well as the more general goals of sustainability. We found that current research puts a strong emphasis on rare earth elements, being addressed in almost half of the identified projects. Other frequently studied metals include cobalt, indium and platinum group metals. The efforts are roughly evenly distributed between the three main domains of supply security measures: primary supply, secondary supply, and material efficiency and substitution, with a somewhat larger budget allocated to secondary supply. Current research is coherent with the aims of the Raw Materials Initiative in that it addresses primary production, recycling, and substitution as means to secure the supply of critical metals. However, the prioritization of certain metals, especially rare earth elements, is stronger than what seems justified by differences in economic risk (as a quantitative interpretation of criticality), and should perhaps be replaced by a more balanced distribution of funds. For example, more product-centric research considering a larger part of the materials cycle may facilitate recycling of a wider spectrum of metals. Particularly neglected metals and topics include beryllium, magnesium, recycling from end-of-life vehicles, design for recycling, and waste collection.", "Solid polymer electrolytes based on lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide/poly(vinylidene fluoride -co-hexafluoropropylene) for safer rechargeable lithium-ion batteries ": "The increasing use of electronic portable systems and the consequent energy demand, leads to the need to improve energy storage systems. According to that and due to safety issues, high-performance non-flammable electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) are needed.\n                  SPE containing different amounts of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), PVDF-HFP, polymer matrix have been prepared by solvent casting. The addition of LiTFSI into PVDF-HFP allows to tailor thermal, mechanical and electrical properties of the composite.\n                  In particular, the ionic conductivity of the composites increases with LiTFSI content, the best ionic conductivities of 0.0011\u202fmS/cm at 25\u202f\u00b0C and 0.23\u202fmS/cm at 90\u202f\u00b0C were obtained for the PVDF-HFP/LiTFSI composites with 80\u202fwt% of LiTFSI.\n                  This solid electrolyte allows the fabrication of Li metallic/SPE/C-LiFePO4 half-cells with a discharge capacity of 51.2\u202fmAh/g at C/20. Further, theoretical simulations show that the discharge capacity value depends on the lithium concentration and percentage of free ions and is independent of the solid polymer electrolyte thickness. On the other hand, the voltage plateau depends on the SPE thickness. Thus, a solid electrolyte is presented for the next generation of safer solid-state batteries.", "A continuously variable transmission for efficient urban transportation ": "This paper describes a new continuously variable transmission (CVT) that may be used in a variety of machines and transport devices. Unlike many CVTs that are relatively heavy and bulky, the present CVT, named \u201ceDrive\u201d, is fairly small and lightweight. These attributes allow eDrive to be used in human-powered transport devices such as bicycles. The eDrive incorporates a sprocket able to vary its effective diameter via computer controlled actuation. The sprocket accommodates a rotational input and provides an output using a loop belt rotationally engaged with sprocket. The eDrive promises to increase a bicyclist's user experience, provide more efficient conversion of human energy to locomotion, and overall promote sustainable urban transportation. In addition, eDrive can be configured and scaled to provide CVT functionality for a variety of other vehicles and machines, such as wind or water turbines and electric vehicles.", "The formation and effect of defect dipoles in lead-free piezoelectric ceramics: A review ": "As one of the most crucial intrinsic contributions, defect dipoles show unique and prominent influence on the responsive behavior of piezoelectric ceramics. Here, we present the formation of the defect dipoles and the state-of-the-art effect on lead-free piezoelectric ceramics in detail. First, the formation of defect dipoles in ceramics are demonstrated. The coupling effect between defect dipole polarization and normal ferroelectric spontaneous polarization, which results in the unusual ferroelectric properties (e.g., \u201cpinched\u201d or asymmetric polarization hysteresis loops) and high electric field induced-strain performance in piezoelectric ceramics, is elaborated. Thereafter, we systematically introduce the switching and decoupling process of defect dipoles under different external conditions. Finally, the researches about the effect of defect dipoles on various lead-free piezoelectric ceramics are presented herein, with special attention on the three systems: the barium titanate, sodium-bismuth titanate and potassium sodium niobate. The remaining challenges, however, such as weak temperature/cycling stability, still need further effort for the extensive applications of these materials.", "Thermal insulation materials based on agricultural residual wheat straw and corn husk biomass, for application in sustainable buildings ": "The high energy consumption in buildings is a major contributor to climate change and atmospheric pollution in south cities of Chile. In this context, insulation materials are a key factor to reduce the energy demand during the operational stage of a building. These materials are however commonly fabricated from petrochemicals with high energy consumption, causing significant detrimental effects on the environment during the production and discarding stage. Due these reasons, insulation materials based on natural fibers waste appear as an excellent alternative, due to abundant availability in south regions of Chile, potential low cost, low energy consumption during the production stage and high bio-degradation rate at the end of life. In this research, block type insulation based on wheat straw and corn husk residual fibers were developed. Taguchi method was applied to investigate the effect on thermal conductivity and density of four control factors in three levels, namely fiber length, boiling time; NaOH concentration and blending time; in a L-9 orthogonal array. Furthermore, flexural and compressive stress were determined and compared with expanded polystyrene block insulation. The results show thermal conductivity values were between 0.046 and 0.047\u202fW/mK. In addition, flexural stress results were good compared to those of the standard expanded polystyrene type IX. Finally, optimum conditions of the process were determined to obtain a final block, which was morphologically analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while the thermal behavior was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).", "Gold nanoparticle based photothermal therapy: Development and application for effective cancer treatment ": "Recent advances in nanomedicine make it auspicious for cancer diagnosis and treatment. A possible non-invasive photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancer treatment could be constructed by combining the nanomedicine and laser. PTT employs photothermal agents (PTAs) with high photothermal conversion efficacy for converting light into heat to selectively kill cancer cells under the help of lasers. Because of the unique Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) phenomenon and the tunable near-infrared (NIR) region absorption, noble metal nanoparticles like gold nanoparticles can be applied as a PTA for PTT. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) offer the enhanced absorption and scattering properties, the optical properties tunability, and specific tumor targeting capability, therefore, AuNPs based PTT turns to be furthermore promising. However, drawbacks such as long retention time, cytotoxicity, and insufficient cancer cells targeting restrict the application of AuNPs as PTTs. This review overviews research of the PTT applications of various modified AuNPs in previous publications. With the advancement of chemical synthesis technology, AuNPs of various shapes and sizes can be synthesized with desired properties, which can achieve multimodal cancer treatment with enhanced anti- tumor effect. In this review, we summarized the major features of five principal types of AuNPs: gold nanorods, gold nanoshells, gold nanospheres, gold nanocages, and gold nanostars with different sizes, discussed their advantages and disadvantages in PTT. We also detailed the surface modification of AuNPs which could be beneficial for the performance of AuNPs based PTT. In addition, depending on properties of AuNPs and lasers, the underlying mechanism of cell death triggered by NIR laser can be different, which also affects the anti-cancer effects and outcomes of PTT. However, controlling cell death through a desired cell death mechanism to achieve desired PTT outcome is still a challenge.", "Water purification by using Adsorbents: A Review ": "There are number of water purification techniques but the adsorption is one of the most simplest, effective and economical method for wastewater purification.

Microorganism plays an essential part in bioremediation of heavy metals. By using genetic engineering, genetically modified organisms can be generated which can likely reduce different types of polycyclichydrocarbons (PAHs). Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Methosinus, Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Stereum hirsutum, Nocardia, Methanogens, Aspergilus niger, Pleurotus ostreatus, Rhizopus arrhizus, Azotobacter, Alcaligenes, Phormidium valderium, Ganoderma applantus are some microbial species that help in bioremediation of heavy metals. This review not only discussed about the importance of microbes for bioremediation of heavy metals but also discussed about the challenges and limitations of native and engineered bacteria for bioremediation. Significance of bioremediation with the help of genetically engineered bacteria is in light because of its eco-friendly nature and minimum health hazards other than the physio-chemical dependent strategies, which are less eco friendly and dangerous to life.", "Removal of toxic pollutants from water environment by phytoremediation: A survey on application and future prospects ": "Pollutants is one of the ecological contaminations for the time being days as effect of mechanical improvement in a few nations. Heavy metals and dyes give harmful consequences for human wellbeing and cause a few genuine maladies. A few systems have been utilizing for expelling toxic contaminants from the natural yet these strategies have impediments, for example, cost expense, logistical issues and time consuming, low efficiency. Phytoremediation is the best alternative for tidying up condition, as it is the naturally economical and ecologically practical innovation. Phytoremediation offers proprietors and chiefs of toxic polluted locales is an imaginative and financially effective choice to address headstrong natural contaminants. As it uses plants characteristic capacity to suck the contamination present in the dirt. There are numerous plants having this regular capacity to up take the toxic contaminants and natural contaminations from air, soil and water. There are distinctive subsets of phytoremediation; the most successfully utilized ones are (a) Phytostabilization (b) Rhizodegradation (c) Rhizofiltration (d) Phytodegradation (e) Phytoextraction (f) Phytoaccumulation (g) Phytovolatilization.

Plastics size less than 5\u00a0mm are categorized as Microplastics and it is one of the greatest potential threat to marine environment for the whole world. There are two types of micro-plastics i.e. primary micro-plastics and secondary micro-plastics. Primary microplastics are the by-products of particulate emissions released from industrial production, the release of plastics dust from plastics products. Secondary microplastics are larger plastic particulate material. These micro-plastics eventually end up in water bodies travelling all the way from rivers to seas or oceans. Microplastic can also act as a pollutant transport medium for other toxic elements such as DDT and hexachlorobenzene and eventually end up within the body of a living organism who consume it. The Government Agencies and Non-government organization of different nations have adopted many policies and laws to curb the harmful effects of plastics and microplastics. A concrete and comprehensive plan should be adopted for zero tolerance against plastics waste and peoples participation is a must to achieve the full success.", "Technology alternatives for decontamination of arsenic-rich groundwater\u2014A critical review ": "Arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater is being reckoned as a global problem, as over 296 million people residing in more than 100 countries have already been reported to be affected by arsenic-rich groundwater. Developing countries like Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam are the worst victims of this terrible event. Arsenic naturally exists in more than 320 mineral forms mainly as arsenates, sulfides, sulfo-salts, arsenides, arsenites, oxides, silicates and elemental arsenic. The lifetime cancer risk of arsenic at its Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL of 10 \n                        \u03bc\n                     g/L) is estimated at 0.7 in 100, while for other carcinogens, it ranges from (\n                        \u223c\n                     0.001 to 0.012) in 100. Water, besides food, is the main source of arsenic ingress into the human system.

The paper critically reviews the knowledge of the UHI and UCMs to identify the major shortcomings in the production of action plans. The shortcomings are identified in three aspects including (1) active involvement in UDP/AP (2) urban managerial and governmental actions, and (3) public engagement and participation. More specifically, it is first discussed that the current synthesizing paradigm of UCMs and UHI studies only considers the physical aspects of the problem/solution. Second, climate recommendations have paid a little attention to the imperative role, capacities and motivations of urban governance and managerial organizations. Third, mitigation strategies have been proposed without considering public needs and willingness. To overcome these challenges, a collaborative platform of UCM systems should be developed through a holistic approach. Such platform should provide a ground for efficient interventions in UDP/AP as well as interactions of all actors and indicators. To this end, the technical challenges of the UHI studies and UCM systems to link with UDP/AP are discussed. Second, UCMs should explicitly define the role of urban climate governance, prioritize the actions and state the policy agendas with regard to local government capacities and motivational elements. Finally, local communities\u2019 needs\u2019 and stockholders\u2019 opinions should be involved in the synthesizing process. As a potential solution, need-base approaches and weighing systems should be further developed to consider all urban actors\u2019 perspectives.", "Phytoremediation of contaminated soils by heavy metals and PAHs. A brief review ": "Acute and diffuse contamination of soil by organic and inorganic pollutants causes wide concerns and intentional or accidental introduction of these substances poses serious impact in public health and environment. Heavy metals are elements not degradable and can be teratogenic, mutagenic, endocrine disruptors. PAHs are elements of difficult management and they can cause carcinogenesis and toxicity in human. Different techniques have been used for the remediation of contaminated soils, but the phytoremediation is proposed as possible alternative, convenient and environmentally friendly than traditional physicochemical techniques. Phytoremediation employs different plant species able to accumulate or degrade different contaminants and, the biomass produced can be used for other purposes such as cogeneration of energy and/or biofuels production, obtaining benefits to health, environment and cost management. A better knowledge of phytoremediation potential is essential in order to increase the use of this technique in the near future for remediation of contaminated lands in the economic and sustainable way. This review provides additional information about the application of phytoremediation processes in soils contaminated by heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using herbaceous and woody plants.", "Treatment technologies of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and olive mill wastewater (OMW): A brief review ": "Attributable to the enormous population growth, tonnes of effluents are unavoidably generated throughout the agricultural activities. The inadequate effluents disposal induces perpetual contamination to the sea and river water sources, which has subsequently raised the public environmental concern. For that reason, the handling protocol of agricultural effluents was flagged up as an interest area for research. Despite the environmental hazards, agricultural effluents have the potential to be transformed from wastes into wealth via biological, physicochemical, thermochemical or a combination of processes thereof. The identical characteristics of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and olive mill wastewater (OMW) render the possibility of treating these wastes using the similar treatment method. Generally, biological treatment requires a longer process time compared to physicochemical and thermochemical technologies despite its easy and low-cost operation. Comparatively, physicochemical and thermochemical methods extend their potentiality in converting the agricultural effluents into higher value products more efficiently. This paper reviews the source and characteristics of both POME and OMW. Subsequently, a comparison of the current and alternative treatments for both effluents was done before the future perspectives of both effluents\u2019 treatment are paved based on the well-being of the human, environment, and economic.", "Status of carbon capture and storage in India\u2019s coal fired power plants: A critical review ": "India is a country with developing mixed economy and requires a huge amount of energy to complete industrial as well as daily social need of its countrymen. Majority of its energy demand is going to be fulfill by coal based power plants. The country is heavily reliant on coal used as a primary fuel in power plant. However, the use of coal at higher level polluting the environment in a continuous manner. Alone, India\u2019s power sector is responsible for half of all CO2 emission in the nation and therefore a serious attention is required in this direction to reduce (GHG) emissions in the environment. Presently, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) act as a bridging technology and a viable option for coal fired power plants to extract CO2. But, still in India the adoption of CCS in coal fired power plant is poor. In UNFCCCs Paris Summit, India committed to reduce its carbon intensity by 30%\u201333% by 2030. The present study deals with the scenario of CCS with various challenges and its implementation efforts in India.", "Mechanistic understanding and future prospect of microbe-enhanced phytoremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil ": "Restoring polluted land is a time-consuming endeavor due to the difficulty inherent in the process. The quality of soil considerably worsens with the addition of toxic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of industrial origin. Industrialization results in millions of tonnes of POPs worldwide, which pose a threat to surrounding ecosystems. In India alone, oil refineries generate approximately 28,000 tonnes of oily sludge (toxic organic compounds) per annum containing POPs\u2014polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These PAHs have existed in environments throughout the globe for the last several decades due to long half-lives. The fate of PAHs and their residues pose a threat to all forms of life. High levels of the 16 PAHs (US EPA) were found in soil in Asia\u2019s oldest oil and gas drilling site, with a range spanning from a minimum of 13.48 to a maximum of 86.3 mgkg\n                        \n                           \n                           \n                              \u2212\n                              1\n                           \n                        \n                     due to exploration of crude oil. The management of such a paradoxical situation is a challenge. The mitigation of PAHs by employing plant\u2013microbe systems from soil is a low-cost prospective biotechnological approach. This technology engineers the rhizosphere and helps restoration of degraded land. Recent findings demonstrated how adding biochar (carbon rich phytoproduct) to the soil resulted in positive effects on plant\u2013microbe assisted PAH removal. This review focuses on the mechanistic understanding of plant\u2013microbe assisted remediation. We consider the future prospect to optimize the phytoremediation process through genomics and metabolomics data.

Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) is highly sought materials in an automobile, aerospace, structural, transportation and other industries due to its excellent mechanical performance, durability, and lightweight. Currently, miscellaneous industries manufacture engineered composite products using FRP materials, especially the products of hardbound thermoset resins, which are difficult to reprocess or reuse. Landfills and incineration are the most common technique for discarding the non-degradable FRP waste that has created an inimical impact on the environment and ecosystem. In order to reduce the ecological burden, we need to evaluate economical and feasible FRP recycling techniques. Extensive investigations conducted over the past decades have proven their efficacy in substituting the currently existing recycling processes. This review article enumerates the mechanical, thermal (fluidised bed and pyrolysis), chemical (low temperature and supercritical temperature) recycling methodologies, and their efficiency in degrading copious FRP materials like glass, carbon, natural etc. In addition, the economic and environmental aspects of fibre reinforced plastic materials based on life cycle assessment (LCA) has been discussed.", "Experimental studies of slag filter for drinking water treatment ": "The study examined the use of granulated blast furnace slag, an industrial by-product from ferrous industries for drinking water treatment. A laboratory scale filter, 9\u00a0cm diameter and 40\u00a0cm with iron slag media supported on a gravel bed could completely remove turbidity, total suspended solids and colour for an average influent loading of 28.26 NTU, 128.85 mg/L and 177.05 PCU respectively at a filtration rate of 0.32 m3hr\u22121m\u22122. The average removal of hardness, sulphate, nitrate, chloride and iron were 35%, 83%, 71%, 28% and 94% for an average influent loading of 579.79 mgL\u22121, 367.72 mgL\u22121, 120.52 mgL\u22121, 355.67 mgL\u22121 and 1.49 mgL\u22121respectively. Doubling the filtration rate with slight increase in loading rate showed 100% removal for turbidity, suspended solids and colour whereas hardness, sulphate, nitrate, chloride and iron removals were 27%, 73%, 86%, 28% and 95% respectively. The maximum head loss for continuous operation without backwash was only 75\u00a0mm. Intermittent washing helped to improve the filtered water quality for various filtration and loading rates. An increase in the rate of filtration up to 1.28 m3hr\u22121m\u22122 did not have any impact on the quality of treated water except sulphate and nitrate. After backwashing, there was considerable improvement in chloride removal. The removal of physicochemical parameters was due to precipitation, adsorption and ion exchange with the formation of products both at the surface and within the slag media. FTIR and XRD results also confirmed the behaviour of slag as an anion exchange resin. The maximum head loss observed in slag filter was 190\u00a0mm at the highest loading level and filtration rate.", "Nanopesticidal potential of silver nanocomposites synthesized from the aqueous extracts of red seaweeds ": "In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) green synthesized using the aqueous extracts of agar seaweeds (Gracilaria corticata and G. edulis) and carrageenan seaweeds (Hypnea musciformis and Spyridia hypnoides) were found effective (antibacterial activity) against Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri and X. oryzae pv. oryzae and antifungal activity against Ustilaginoidea virens under in vitro condition.

Past use has resulted in their widespread accumulation in water sources, sediments and biota. They may pose risks to human health and the environment. Several technologies have been tested for removing PFOS and PFOA from water but most have only been developed at laboratory scale. This paper provides a critical review of existing methods for removing PFOS and PFOA from wastewaters with an emphasis on identifying processes that show promise for the development of practical industrial-scale remediation technologies. It is concluded that among the remediation technologies cited in the literature, removal by activated carbon has been the most widely used, with several successful field tests being reported. However, a number of limitations to the use of activated carbon exist, such as being ineffective at removing PFOA and other PFCs. Other adsorbents that have the potential to treat aqueous PFOS and PFOA include organo-clays, clay minerals and carbon nanotubes.", "Combined ozone oxidation process and adsorption methods for the removal of acetaminophen and amoxicillin from aqueous solution; kinetic and optimisation ": "The growing use of pharmaceuticals raises questions on their potential risk to human health and water quality. This research aimed to introduce a combined treatment technique with high performance in removing pharmaceutical micropollutants (MPs) from aqueous solution. The research included two steps, ozone treatment (first step) and adsorption technique (second step). The elimination of acetaminophen (ACT) and amoxicillin (AMX) with ozone reactor, first step, was optimised by artificial neural network (ANN). The optimisation process included two independent variables, namely, initial concentration of MPs and ozone dosage. On the basis of ANN, the linear regression coefficient denoted by R2 between predicted and experimental MP removals was close to 1. Result displayed that the prediction by the trained ANN is acceptable. Approximately 0.17 mg/L (84.8%) of ACT and 0.16\u00a0mg/L (82.7%) of AMX were removed at the initial concentration of 0.2\u00a0mg/L and ozone dosage of 15\u00a0mg/L. Beside it, ozonation experiments showed that the rate of constant (m\n                        \n                           \n                           \n                              \u2212\n                              1\n                           \n                        \n                     s\n                        \n                           \n                           \n                              \u2212\n                              1\n                           \n                        \n                     ) for ACT and AMX were 2.63\n                        \u00d7\n                     106 and 5.98 \n                        \u00d7\n                     106 respectively. After treating by ozone reactor, water was subjected to pass through the cross-linked chitosan/bentonite as a fixed-bed column, for second step. ACT and AMX were not detected after step 2.", "Slow release urea fertilizer synthesized through recrystallization of urea incorporating natural bentonite using various binders ": "In this study, various slow release urea fertilizers (SRUFs) were prepared by incorporation of urea into local natural bentonite with various binder i.e. corn starch and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). In the preparation, a binder was added to a mixture of natural bentonite and melted urea. Then, the admixture was put into a mould and extruded to obtain SRUF in the form of pellets. The SRUF was dried at 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 8\u00a0h before use. Urea desorption mechanisms of the SRUF was examined through static release experiments. The structural properties of SRUF was characterized through scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was found from static release experiments that the SRUFs more slowly released urea in water than conventional urea fertilizer. After 500\u00a0min of the experiment, the slowest release of urea was achieved by SRUF using corn starch. Meanwhile, conventional urea fertilizer completely released urea in water after less than 50\u00a0min. Release mechanisms of the SRUF using corn starch and SRUF using HPMC were anomalous transport and Fickian diffusion, respectively.", "Effect of substrate ratio on biogas yield for anaerobic co-digestion of fruit vegetable waste & sugarcane bagasse ": "The present study investigates the influence of mixture of waste activated sludge (WAS) as inoculum (I) to the ratio of sugarcane bagasse (SB) and fruit-vegetable waste (FVW) as substrate (S) on biogas yield during anaerobic co-digestion. The lignin content of SB is very high, limiting its application for anaerobic digestion; therefore, FVW was used at varied ratio as substrate. Batch studies were conducted under ambient conditions in 500 mL glass bottles for 30 d at five different mixtures ratio of SB: FVW (100:0, 70:30, 50:50, 30:70 and 0:100) at different organic loading rate (OLR) varied from 0.85\u20132.4 g VS L\u22121 d\u22121 and at fixed Inoculum/Substrate (I/S) ratio of 1.

The experimental data was validated with modified Gompertz equation and first order model and fits well. The kinetic coefficients determined at optimum ratio of 70:30 from Gompertz model were well supported the experimental data.", "Emerging environmental contaminants: Challenges facing our next generation and potential engineering solutions ": "While our current generation continues to make efforts to remediate and minimize traditional pollutants in the environment, other \u201cemerging\u201d environmental contaminants are now warranting attention. These include perfluorinated compounds, nanomaterials, pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, antibacterials, hormones, flame retardants, disinfection by-products (DBPs), artificial sweeteners, benzotriazoles, 1,4-dioxane, and algal toxins, as well as emerging contaminants on the horizon: prions and ionic liquids. Wastewater effluents are a major source for many of these emerging contaminants, due to their use in products we use in our households, from pharmaceuticals, detergents, fabric coatings, foam cushions, lotions, sunscreens, cosmetics, hair products, foods and beverages, and food packaging. After use, these chemicals are released in wastewater, and because many are incompletely removed in wastewater treatment, they enter our rivers and drinking water supplies. Surface run-off and agricultural run-off can also be important sources of their entry into the environment. Moreover, many of these contaminants can transform in the environment, from such processes as microbial degradation, photolysis, and hydrolysis, and they can also react with disinfectants in drinking water or wastewater treatment to form disinfection by-products. Issues surrounding these emerging contaminants, include widespread occurrence, bioaccumulation, persistence, and toxicity. Climate change can also serve to exasperate their effects by concentrating them in rivers during times of drought and by causing resuspension of some (like nanomaterials) during floods. This review will discuss these issues surrounding emerging contaminants and also propose some engineering solutions for the future.", "Extraction and characterization of chitin and chitosan from fishery waste by chemical method ": "After cellulose, chitin is the most widespread biopolymer available in nature. Chitin has economic value because of its biological activities, industrial and biomedical applications. There are three sources of chitin, namely crustaceans, insects and microorganism. The commercial sources of chitin are shells of crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, lobsters and krill. In the present study, chitin has been extracted from locally available fish in Rourkela. The obtained chitin was converted into the more useful chitosan. The obtained chitin and chitosan have been characterized by using different techniques like spectral analysis, X-ray diffraction, Elemental analysis, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). XRD analysis indicated the crystalline nature of the chitin and chitosan. The FTIR patterns displayed the bands corresponding to stretching and vibration of O-H, N-H and CO bonds and conformed the formation of \n                        \u03b1\n                     -chitin.

To occupy the palm oil world market demand, palm oil industry needs to produce more than the market demand to supply necessity. Currently, South East Asia country such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand rank the top country with the largest production of palm oil in the world. However, the increasing demand for the palm oil has resulted in even massive waste especially palm oil mill effluent (POME). Direct discharge of POME will adversely affect the environment. In 2011, 53 million tonnes metric of palm oil produced and 89% of this production comes from Malaysia and Indonesia. Thailand, however, used the palm oil solely for domestic usage. Since POME has been declared among the major source of pollution, a great deal of research and development including application devoted to enhance the current treatment method for POME to consistently meet the proposed stringent regulatory requirement by environmental authority. Conventional treatment such as ponding system is the most commonplace method to treat POME through the application of ponding system which is include aerobic and anaerobic treatment. Recently, the alternative methods such as coagulation, flocculation, adsorption, advanced oxidation process (AOP) and membrane technology to treat POME has shown a promising result compared to the conventional method.", "Enhanced nitrogen removal by the integrated constructed wetlands with artificial aeration ": "The removal of organic pollutants, ammonia, and phosphorus from seriously polluted river water has been extensively explored using various traditional integrated constructed wetland systems. However, the removal efficiency of nitrogen was extremely low due to the limited oxygen concentration of these traditional systems. Herein, a novel pilot-scale integrated constructed wetland system (CWs), which consisted mainly of a biotic contacting oxidization pre-treatment (BCO), an artificial aeration vertical sub-surface flow CWs, and a horizontal subsurface flow CWs\u00a0were applied to enhance the removal of total nitrogen (TN) under high hydraulic loading through artificial aeration. Results showed that, with the application of the novel CW systems, a total of 64.97% removal of TN was achieved with the average inflow of 11.39 mg/L and hydraulic load of 1.67 m3\n                     \n                        \u22c5\n                     m\u22122\n                     \n                        \u22c5\n                     d\u22121. Further analysis showed that the contributions of BCO, AVFCWs and HF CWs to TN removal were 13.86%, 15.97% and 35.36%, respectively. Besides the TN removal, the CW systems can also obtained about 75% of ammonia removal, within which artificial aeration vertical subsurface flow CWs unit occupied about 60% of contribution. Flowing by the application of this systems, the concentrations of ammonia and nitrate in the outflow decreased to 2.66 and 2.01 mg/L, respectively. The study indicated that the integrated constructed wetland system applied can be an efficiently potential technique for the removal of COD, NH4-N and TP from some rural wastewater.", "Environmental applications of thermally modified and acid activated clay minerals: Current status of the art ": "Adsorption has been the most common technology used for water and wastewater treatment for a number of reasons including simplicity, flexibility in design, high efficiency and cost effectiveness. Although it has been a proven technology for removal of contaminants including heavy metals, it has a major limitation to its application, which is the cost of the adsorbent. In this context, natural clay minerals are considered as low cost materials because they are abundant and can be easily modified to improve their surface properties (e.g., surface area, charge) and consequently increase the adsorption capacity and a wide range of other applicabilities. The two most common modification methods of clay minerals are thermal modification and acid activation. The aim of this paper is to critically review the current status of thermally modified and acid activated clay minerals for environmental applications. It will evaluate the adsorption efficiencies and conditions for removal of contaminants and identify the existing data gaps to widespread commercial uptake of the technology.", "FeOOH-modified clay sorbents for arsenic removal from aqueous solutions ": "The presence of arsenic (As) in natural and anthropogenic soils causes severe pollution of groundwater due to its harmful carcinogenic effects. The present work describes the research activities for searching of appropriate innovative sorbents based on clay material for As sorption using iron oxy-hydroxide modification. Natural and manufactured clay was chosen for comparison of modification efficiency in order to obtain best sorption results for As(V). The results of pilot testing were obtained and the sorption was studied as a function of initial arsenic concentration. Obtained results indicate that modification of clay with Fe compounds significantly improves the sorption capacity of a newly developed material used for sorption of As(V). Efficiency of sorption for Fe-modified clay is highly dependent on clay type as well as iron content in it. Further perspectives of investigations are recovered during this study in order to create more efficient and relatively cheap sorbents for As removal from aqueous solutions.", "Petroleum hydrocarbons (PH) in groundwater aquifers: An overview of environmental fate, toxicity, microbial degradation and risk-based remediation approaches ": "Petroleum hydrocarbon (PH) contamination of soil and aquatic ecosystems is a serious global issue. PH are classified as xenobiotics and emerging priority pollutants. When released into the environment, fate and behavior of PH varies widely with the particular composition and physicochemical properties. Usually, PH with higher molecular weight are toxic and seldom mobilizes in subsurface plumes when compared to their low molecular weight counterparts. Due to the toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic nature of PH, various remediation approaches are currently employed for their clean-up from the environment. Degradation of PH by the activity of native microbes is considered as a significant eco-friendly and cost effective approach for the remediation of PH contaminated sites. Changes in the microbial adaptations and dynamics are important indicators for monitoring the effects of PH contamination. Several analytical techniques are available for the identification and quantification of PH present in contaminated sites. Also, toxicity tests are widely employed to monitor the effect of remediated sites where analytical techniques fall short to identify certain PH due to the lack of standardized methods and low concentrations. Consequently, this review provides an overview of environmental fate, toxicity, and remediation of PH with particular emphasis on risk-based remediation which considers the use of both analytical and toxicological studies for effective management and remediation of PH contaminated sites.", "Food waste matters - A systematic review of household food waste practices and their policy implications ": "In recent years, food waste has received growing interest from local, national and European policymakers, international organisations, NGOs as well as academics from various disciplinary fields. Increasing concerns about food security and environmental impacts, such as resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions attributed to food waste, have intensified attention to the topic. While food waste occurs in all stages of the food supply chain, private households have been identified as key actors in food waste generation. However, the evidence on why food waste occurs remains scattered. This paper maps the still small but expanding academic territory of consumer food waste by systematically reviewing empirical studies on food waste practices as well as distilling factors that foster and impede the generation of food waste on the household level. Moreover, we briefly discuss the contributions of different social ontologies, more particularly psychology-related approaches and social practice theory. The analysis reveals food waste as a complex and multi-faceted issue that cannot be attributed to single variables; this also calls for a stronger integration of different disciplinary perspectives. Mapping the determinants of waste generation deepens the understanding of household practices and helps design food waste prevention strategies. Finally, we link the identified factors with a set of policy, business, and retailer options.", "A literature and practice review to develop sustainable business model archetypes ": "Eco-innovations, eco-efficiency and corporate social responsibility practices define much of the current industrial sustainability agenda. While important, they are insufficient in themselves to deliver the holistic changes necessary to achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. How can we encourage corporate innovation that significantly changes the way companies operate to ensure greater sustainability?\n                  Sustainable business models (SBM) incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests, including environment and society. They are important in driving and implementing corporate innovation for sustainability, can help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes, and serve as a key driver of competitive advantage.\n                  Many innovative approaches may contribute to delivering sustainability through business models, but have not been collated under a unifying theme of business model innovation. The literature and business practice review has identified a wide range of examples of mechanisms and solutions that can contribute to business model innovation for sustainability. The examples were collated and analysed to identify defining patterns and attributes that might facilitate categorisation.\n                  Sustainable business model archetypes are introduced to describe groupings of mechanisms and solutions that may contribute to building up the business model for sustainability. The aim of these archetypes is to develop a common language that can be used to accelerate the development of sustainable business models in research and practice. The archetypes are: Maximise material and energy efficiency; Create value from \u2018waste\u2019; Substitute with renewables and natural processes; Deliver functionality rather than ownership; Adopt a stewardship role; Encourage sufficiency; Re-purpose the business for society/environment; and Develop scale-up solutions.", "Environmental impact of textile reuse and recycling \u2013 A review ": "This paper reviews studies of the environmental impact of textile reuse and recycling, to provide a summary of the current knowledge and point out areas for further research. Forty-one studies were reviewed, whereof 85% deal with recycling and 41% with reuse (27% cover both reuse and recycling). Fibre recycling is the most studied recycling type (57%), followed by polymer/oligomer recycling (37%), monomer recycling (29%), and fabric recycling (14%). Cotton (76%) and polyester (63%) are the most studied materials.\n                  The reviewed publications provide strong support for claims that textile reuse and recycling in general reduce environmental impact compared to incineration and landfilling, and that reuse is more beneficial than recycling. The studies do, however, expose scenarios under which reuse and recycling are not beneficial for certain environmental impacts. For example, as benefits mainly arise due to the avoided production of new products, benefits may not occur in cases with low replacement rates or if the avoided production processes are relatively clean. Also, for reuse, induced customer transport may cause environmental impact that exceeds the benefits of avoided production, unless the use phase is sufficiently extended.\n                  In terms of critical methodological assumptions, authors most often assume that textiles sent to recycling are wastes free of environmental burden, and that reused products and products made from recycled materials replace products made from virgin fibres. Examples of other content mapped in the review are: trends of publications over time, common aims and geographical scopes, commonly included and omitted impact categories, available sources of primary inventory data, knowledge gaps and future research needs. The latter include the need to study cascade systems, to explore the potential of combining various reuse and recycling routes.", "Sustainable business model innovation: A review ": "The capability to rapidly and successfully move into new business models is an important source of sustainable competitive advantage and a key leverage to improve the sustainability performance of organisations. However, research suggests that many business model innovations fail. Despite the importance of the topic, the reasons for failure are relatively unexplored, and there is no comprehensive review of the sustainable business model innovation literature. This research provides a review of the literature, using a systematic database search and cross-reference snowballing. Its key contributions are: (1) a review of the key underlying concepts, discussing their similarities and differences and offer new definitions where there is an identified need; (2) we identify a research gap; and (3) we deduct research questions to address the gap.", "Techno-economic assessment of CO2 direct air capture plants ": "CO2 direct air capture (DAC) has been increasingly discussed as a climate change mitigation option. Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about DAC's current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine DAC's anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art DAC technologies are performed, wherein, DAC technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions (HT DAC) and low temperature solid sorbent (LT DAC) systems, from an energy system perspective. DAC capital expenditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for DAC capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. DAC system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that LT DAC systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. CO2 capture costs of LT DAC systems powered by hybrid PV-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 \u20ac/tCO2 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. These new findings could enhance DAC's role in a successful climate change mitigation strategy.", "Additive manufacturing and sustainability: an exploratory study of the advantages and challenges ": "The emergence of advanced manufacturing technologies, coupled with consumer demands for more customised products and services, are causing shifts in the scale and distribution of manufacturing. In this paper, consideration is given to the role of one such advanced manufacturing process technology: additive manufacturing. The consequences of adopting this novel production technology on industrial sustainability are not well understood and this exploratory study draws on publically available data to provide insights into the impacts of additive manufacturing on sustainability. Benefits are found to exist across the product and material life cycles through product and process redesign, improvements to material input processing, make-to-order component and product manufacturing, and closing the loop. As an immature technology, there are substantial challenges to these benefits being realised at each stage of the life cycle. This paper summarises these advantages and challenges, and discusses the implications of additive manufacturing on sustainability in terms of the sources of innovation, business models, and the configuration of value chains.", "The role of transformation in learning and education for sustainability ": "Education research has acknowledged the value of transformation, which offers an opportunity for researching and rethinking how appropriate and successful educational practices may be. However, despite the role of transformation in higher education and particularly in sustainability learning, there is a paucity of studies which examine the extent to which transformation and learning on matters related to sustainable development may be integrated.\n                  Based on this perceived research need, the purpose of this article is to present how transformation in learning in education for sustainability requires the commitment of Faculty and the engament of students. To do this, a set of qualitative case studies were used in higher education institutions across seven countries (Brazil, Serbia, Latvia, South Africa, Spain, Syria, UK). The findings revealed that the concept of education for sustainable development has not been sufficiently integrated into the concept of transformation in higher education institutions. It also found that to enhance sustainability in the curricula, academics should develop collaborative approaches, and discuss how to redesign their own disciplines, and how to appreciate the epistemology and multicultural vision of sustainability, both as a topic, and as a field of education research. It was further found that reflections of the academics on their own values are crucial for developing the transformative potential of students as agents of a sustainable future. It is necessary that universities should transform to serve as models of social justice and environmental stewardship, and to foster sustainability learning.", "The Circular Economy \u2013 A new sustainability paradigm? ": "While the terms Circular Economy and sustainability are increasingly gaining traction with academia, industry, and policymakers, the similarities and differences between both concepts remain ambiguous. The relationship between the concepts is not made explicit in literature, which is blurring their conceptual contours and constrains the efficacy of using the approaches in research and practice. This research addresses this gap and aims to provide conceptual clarity by distinguishing the terms and synthesising the different types of relationships between them. We conducted an extensive literature review, employing bibliometric analysis and snowballing techniques to investigate the state of the art in the field and synthesise the similarities, differences and relationships between both terms. We identified eight different relationship types in the literature and illustrated the most evident similarities and differences between both concepts.", "Effects of feedstock on larval development and process efficiency in waste treatment with black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) ": "Global population growth has led to an urgent need for more efficient food production systems. Moreover, as income levels increase, dietary preferences are shifting to more animal-based products. However, current feed protein sources deplete wild fish populations and contribute to rainforest deforestation. Capturing the resources in organic waste could help alleviate environmental impacts of food production. The larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) are ferocious feeders on decomposing organic material and could be used as protein source in animal feed. This study evaluated development of black soldier fly larvae on eight urban organic waste fractions and two control substrates. Principal component analysis was conducted to identify substrate properties that contributed to treatment efficiency and larval development. The main treatment factors found to be affected by substrate were waste-to-biomass conversion ratio, larval development time and final prepupal weight. The substrate properties with the greatest impact on biomass conversion ratio and larval development time were content of total volatile solids and protein content, while only total volatile solids content affected final prepupal weight. It was concluded that black soldier fly larvae are versatile in their feedstock preferences and can be used to treat a variety of organic waste streams, provided that the total volatile solids and nitrogen content are sufficiently high to support larval development. Abattoir waste, food waste, human faeces and a mixture of abattoir waste \u2013 fruits & vegetables are waste streams that are highly suitable for fly larvae treatment.", "Circular economy as an essentially contested concept ": "The Circular Economy (CE) is currently a popular notion within the policy and business advocacy groups. Despite being visionary and provocative in its message, the research on the CE concept is emerging. The two intertwined objectives of the paper are; first to identify, discuss and develop the various definitions provided by the emerging literature. Secondly, to suggest an initial research approach with which research on CE can be conducted. Our analysis shows that the existing CE work is mainly done on the practical and technical levels of the actual physical flows of materials and energy in production-consumption systems. The focus of the extant literature is on concrete metrics, tools, instruments and computations. Therefore, the basic assumptions concerning the values, societal structures, cultures, underlying world-views and the paradigmatic potential of CE remain largely unexplored. We argue that CE has already become what Gallie (1955) more than six decades ago termed as an \u201cessentially contested concept\u201d (ECC). The paper further suggests a model for CE research that helps in the categorization, classification and organization of research and investigation on CE. The model can help in limiting the observed unbalance and enhance the contribution of the CE approach to a more sustainable global society.", "The triple layered business model canvas: A tool to design more sustainable business models ": "The Triple Layered Business Model Canvas is a tool for exploring sustainability-oriented business model innovation. It extends the original business model canvas by adding two layers: an environmental layer based on a lifecycle perspective and a social layer based on a stakeholder perspective. When taken together, the three layers of the business model make more explicit how an organization generates multiple types of value \u2013 economic, environmental and social. Visually representing a business model through this canvas tool supports developing and communicating a more holistic and integrated view of a business model; which also supports creatively innovating towards more sustainable business models. This paper presents the triple layer business model canvas tool and describes its key features through a re-analysis of the Nestl\u00e9 Nespresso business model. This new tool contributes to sustainable business model research by providing a design tool which structures sustainability issues in business model innovation. Also, it creates two new dynamics for analysis: horizontal coherence and vertical coherence.", "A review on circular economy: the expected transition to a balanced interplay of environmental and economic systems ": "In the last few years Circular Economy (CE) is receiving increasing attention worldwide as a way to overcome the current production and consumption model based on continuous growth and increasing resource throughput. By promoting the adoption of closing-the-loop production patterns within an economic system CE aims to increase the efficiency of resource use, with special focus on urban and industrial waste, to achieve a better balance and harmony between economy, environment and society. This study provides an extensive review of the literature of last two decades, with the purpose of grasping the main CE features and perspectives: origins, basic principles, advantages and disadvantages, modelling and implementation of CE at the different levels (micro, meso and macro) worldwide.\n                  Results evidence that CE origins are mainly rooted in ecological and environmental economics and industrial ecology. In China CE is promoted as a top-down national political objective while in other areas and countries as European Union, Japan and USA it is a tool to design bottom-up environmental and waste management policies. The ultimate goal of promoting CE is the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth. The implementation of CE worldwide still seems in the early stages, mainly focused on recycle rather than reuse. Important results have been achieved in some activity sectors (e.g. in waste management, where large waste recycling rates are achieved in selected developed countries). CE implies the adoption of cleaner production patterns at company level, an increase of producers and consumers responsibility and awareness, the use of renewable technologies and materials (wherever possible) as well as the adoption of suitable, clear and stable policies and tools. The lesson learned from successful experiences is that the transition towards CE comes from the involvement of all actors of the society and their capacity to link and create suitable collaboration and exchange patterns. Success stories also point out the need for an economic return on investment, in order to provide suitable motivation to companies and investors. In summary, the CE transition has just started. Moreover, the interdisciplinary framework underpinning CE offers good prospects for gradual improvement of the present production and consumption models, no longer adequate because of their environmental load and social inequity, a clear indicator of resource use inefficiency.", "How are cities planning to respond to climate change? Assessment of local climate plans from 885 cities in the EU-28 ": "The Paris Agreement aims to limit global mean temperature rise this century to well below 2\u202f\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This target has wide-ranging implications for Europe and its cities, which are the source of substantial greenhouse gas emissions. This paper reports the state of local planning for climate change by collecting and analysing information about local climate mitigation and adaptation plans across 885 urban areas of the EU-28. A typology and framework for analysis was developed that classifies local climate plans in terms of their alignment with spatial (local, national and international) and other climate related policies. Out of eight types of local climate plans identified in total we document three types of stand-alone local climate plans classified as type A1 (autonomously produced plans), A2 (plans produced to comply with national regulations) or A3 (plans developed for international climate networks). There is wide variation among countries in the prevalence of local climate plans, with generally more plans developed by central and northern European cities. Approximately 66% of EU cities have a type A1, A2, or A3 mitigation plan, 26% an adaptation plan, and 17% a joint adaptation and mitigation plan, while about 33% lack any form of stand-alone local climate plan (i.e. what we classify as A1, A2, A3 plans). Mitigation plans are more numerous than adaptation plans, but planning for mitigation does not always precede planning for adaptation. Our analysis reveals that city size, national legislation, and international networks can influence the development of local climate plans. We found that size does matter as about 80% of the cities with above 500,000 inhabitants have a comprehensive and stand-alone mitigation and/or an adaptation plan (A1). Cities in four countries with national climate legislation (A2), i.e. Denmark, France, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, are nearly twice as likely to produce local mitigation plans, and five times more likely to produce local adaptation plans, compared to cities in countries without such legislation. A1 and A2 mitigation plans are particularly numerous in Denmark, Poland, Germany, and Finland; while A1 and A2 adaptation plans are prevalent in Denmark, Finland, UK and France. The integration of adaptation and mitigation is country-specific and can mainly be observed in two countries where local climate plans are compulsory, i.e. France and the UK. Finally, local climate plans produced for international climate networks (A3) are mostly found in the many countries where autonomous (type A1) plans are less common. This is the most comprehensive analysis of local climate planning to date. The findings are of international importance as they will inform and support decision-making towards climate planning and policy development at national, EU and global level being based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge of local climate planning available to date.", "Food packaging in the circular economy: Overview of chemical safety aspects for commonly used materials ": "Food packaging facilitates storage, handling, transport, and preservation of food and is essential for preventing food waste. Besides these beneficial properties, food packaging causes rising concern for the environment due to its high production volume, often short usage time, and problems related to waste management and littering. Reduction, reuse, and recycling, but also redesign support the aims of the circular economy. These tools also have the potential to decrease the environmental impact of food packaging.\n                  In this article, we focus on chemical safety aspects of recycled food packaging, as recycling is currently seen as an important measure to manage packaging waste. However, recycling may increase the levels of potentially hazardous chemicals in the packaging and -after migration- in the food. Since exposure to certain chemicals migrating from food packaging has been associated with chronic diseases, it is of high importance to assess the safety of recycled packaging. Therefore, we describe recycling processes of commonly used food packaging materials, including plastics, paper and board, aluminum, steel, and multimaterial multilayers (e.g., beverage cartons). Further, we give an overview of typical migrants from all types of recycled food packaging materials, and summarize approaches to reduce chemical contamination. We discuss the role of food packaging in the circular economy, where recycling is only one of many complementary tools for providing environmentally-friendly and safe food packaging.", "From a literature review to a conceptual framework for sustainable supply chain management ": "Academic and corporate interest in sustainable supply chain management has risen considerably in recent years. This can be seen by the number of papers published and in particular by journal special issues. To establish the field further, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it offers a literature review on sustainable supply chain management taking 191 papers published from 1994 to 2007 into account. Second, it offers a conceptual framework to summarize the research in this field comprising three parts. As starting point related triggers are identified. This allows putting forward two distinct strategies: (1) supplier management for risks and performance, and (2) supply chain management for sustainable products. It is evident that research is still dominated by green/environmental issues. Social aspects and also the integration of the three dimensions of sustainability are still rare.\n                  Both practitioners in companies and academics might find the review useful, as it outlines major lines of research in the field. Further, it discusses specific features of sustainable supply chains as well as limitations of existing research; this should stimulate further research.", "Towards a consensus on the circular economy ": "The growing importance of the concept of the circular economy as a way to attain sustainable development has encouraged scholars to propose different ways to understand it. Given the large number of studies done on the circular economy, their differing approaches and their multiple applications, this paper attempts to propose a consensus view of the basic notions of the circular economy framework and highlight its relationship with eco-innovation. To that end, this study carried out a systematic literature review that resulted in four main outputs: a knowledge map of the circular economy, an analysis of the main notions of the concept, principles, and determinants of a circular economy. Finally, this study brings to light some remarkable examples of eco-innovations developed for implementation in the circular economy.", "Preparation, modification and environmental application of biochar: A review ": "Biochar is a carbon-rich material which can be prepared from various organic waste feedstock, such as agricultural wastes and municipal sewage sludge. Biochar has received increasing attention due to its unique feature such as high carbon content and cation exchange capacity, large specific surface area and stable structure. This review systematically analyzed and summarized the preparation, characterization, modification, and especially environmental application of biochar, based on more than 200 papers published in recent 10 year, to provide an overview of biochar with a particular on its environmental application. The physiochemical properties of biochar varies with the types of feedstocks. Pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal carbonization are the common methods for biochar preparation. Biochar can be modified by acid, alkali, oxidizing agents, metal ions, carbonaceous materials, steam and gas purging. The selection of modification methods depends on the environmental application fields. The biochar has been used for soil remediation and amelioration, carbon sequestration, organic solid waste composting, decontamination of water and wastewater, catalyst and activator, electrode materials and electrode modifier, which were discussed in detail. The application of biochar in the carbon sequestration should be further investigated at similar experimental conditions to obtain the consistent results. The effect of biochar on soil microbes should be further investigated to elucidate the dominant reason for the improvement of soil fertility based on different soil and feedstock. In addition, more attention should be paid to the release of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from biochar to the environment when biochar is practically used for the environmental remediation. The relationship between biochar structure and activation capability should be further investigated to clarify the activation mechanism of persulfate by biochar when it is used as activator. In summary, biochar has wide application prospect in environmental remediation, and the mechanism of biochar in environmental application should be further investigated.", "Green, circular, bio economy: A comparative analysis of sustainability avenues ": "Despite their evidently different assumptions and operationalization strategies, the concepts of Circular Economy, Green Economy and Bioeconomy are joined by the common ideal to reconcile economic, environmental and social goals. The three concepts are currently mainstreamed in academia and policy making as key sustainability avenues, but a comparative analysis of such concepts is missing. The aim of this article is thus to comprehensively analyse the diversity within and between such concepts. The results are drawn from a bibliometric review of almost two thousand scientific articles published within the last three decades, coupled with a conceptual analysis. We find that, for what concerns environmental sustainability, Green Economy acts as an \u2018umbrella\u2019 concept, including elements from Circular Economy and Bioeconomy concepts (e.g. eco-efficiency; renewables), as well as additional ideas, e.g. nature-based solutions. In particular, Circular Economy and Bioeconomy are resource-focused, whereas in principle Green Economy acknowledges the underpinning role of all ecological processes. Regarding the social dimension, Green Economy is more inclusive of some aspects at local level (e.g. eco-tourism, education), while there is an emerging discussion in Bioeconomy literature around local processes in terms of biosecurity and rural policies. When considering weak/strong sustainability visions, all concepts remain limited in questioning economic growth. By comparing the different sustainability strategies promoted by these concepts we do not advocate for their substitutability, but for their clarification and reciprocal integration. The findings are discussed in light of the concepts' synergies and limits, with the purpose to inform research and policy implementation.", "Sustainable-responsible tourism discourse \u2013 Towards \u2018responsustable\u2019 tourism ": "Despite several decades of academic and practical debate on tourism sustainability, its application in practice remains difficult. The dominant tourism discourse on sustainability (theory, seen as a concept) and responsibility (practice, understood as appropriate action) calls for a solid understanding of the process of how a responsible destination actually implements a sustainability agenda, which this paper aims to provide. In this context, we explore theoretical perspectives from political economics and behavioural economics to offer a well-reasoned integrated sustainability\u2013responsibility model comprising three stages: Awareness, Agenda and Action. This Triple-A Model complements the sustainability indicators debate and provides advice on how to continuously implement the sustainability concept and move from market-value-led and environmentally laissez-faire tourism towards more environmental- and social-value-driven responsible tourism. In addition, this paper discusses the existing sustainability and responsibility nomenclatures and their use and contributes relevant conclusions on the current understanding of sustainability and responsibility in European and UNWTO practices. The term responsustable tourism is suggested to join two existing terms and demonstrate that the current understanding of responsible tourism behaviour is based on the concept of sustainable tourism.", "Environmental impacts of food consumption in Europe ": "Food consumption is amongst the main drivers of environmental impacts. On one hand, there is the need to fulfil a fundamental human need for nutrition, and on the other hand this poses critical threats to the environment. In order to assess the environmental impact of food consumption, a lifecycle assessment (LCA)-based approach has been applied to a basket of products, selected as being representative of EU consumption. A basket of food products was identified as representative of the average food and beverage consumption in Europe, reflecting the relative importance of the products in terms of mass and economic value. The products in the basket are: pork, beef, poultry, milk, cheese, butter, bread, sugar, sunflower oil, olive oil, potatoes, oranges, apples, mineral water, roasted coffee, beer and pre-prepared meals. For each product in the basket, a highly disaggregated inventory model was developed based on a modular approach, and built using statistical data. The environmental impact of the average food consumption of European citizens was assessed using the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) methodology. The overall results indicate that, for most of the impact categories, the consumed foods with the highest environmental burden are meat products (beef, pork and poultry) and dairy products (cheese, milk and butter). The agricultural phase is the lifecycle stage that has the highest impact of all the foods in the basket, due to the contribution of agronomic and zootechnical activities. Food processing and logistics are the next most important phases in terms of environmental impacts, due to their energy intensity and the related emissions to the atmosphere that occur through the production of heat, steam and electricity and during transport. Regarding the end-of-life phase, human excretion and wastewater treatments pose environmental burdens related to eutrophying substances whose environmental impacts are greater than those of the agriculture, transports and processing phases. Moreover, food losses which occur throughout the whole lifecycle, in terms of agricultural/industrial and domestic food waste, have also to be taken into consideration, since they can amount to up to 60% of the initial weight of the food products. The results of the study go beyond the mere assessment of the potential impacts associated with food consumption, as the overall approach may serve as a baseline for testing eco-innovation scenarios for impact reduction as well as for setting targets.", "Solid waste management: Scope and the challenge of sustainability ": "Solid waste management (SWM) is an integral part of an environmental management system. SWM approaches have been modified into a more practical and effective option to establish sustainability based on the \u201creduce\u201d, \u201creuse\u201d, and \u201crecycle\u201d (3R) principles. This review provides an overview of a wide range of existing SWM strategies with the following key objectives: (i) to comprehensively describe current technologies, strategic innovations, and monitoring tools, (ii) to provide an overview of prevailing waste management scenarios across different countries, (iii) to identify the roles of life cycle assessment (LCA) and other modeling tools in SWM, and (iv) to showcase feasible approaches for sustainable recycling and utilization of solid wastes. The current review finds that geographical positions and economic status of nations are important to dictate waste characteristics. A number of economic and LCA models have been described to facilitate future workers vis-\u00e0-vis organizations for the selection of appropriate waste management algorithms and for the evaluation of their eventual performance. In addition, this paper showcases various innovative solutions that have been reported for the achievement of smart and sustainable waste management plans in many countries.", "Fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars - An analysis of learning rates, user costs, and costs for mitigating CO2 and air pollutant emissions ": "This article presents experience curves and cost-benefit analyses for electric and plug-in hybrid cars sold in Germany. We find that between 2010 and 2016, the prices and price differentials relative to conventional cars declined at learning rates of 23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2% and 32\u202f\u00b1\u202f2% for electric cars and 6\u202f\u00b1\u202f1% and 37\u202f\u00b1\u202f2% for plug-in hybrids. If trends persist, price beak-even with conventional cars may be reached after another 7\u202f\u00b1\u202f1 million electric cars and 5\u202f\u00b1\u202f1 million plug-in hybrids are produced. The user costs of electric and plug-in hybrid cars relative to their conventional counterparts are declining annually by 14% and 26%. Also the costs for mitigating CO2 and air pollutant emissions through the deployment of electrified cars tend to decline. However, at current levels, NOX and particle emissions are still mitigated at lower costs by state-of-the-art after-treatment systems than through the electrification of powertrains. Overall, the observation of robust technological learning suggests policy makers should focus their support on non-cost market barriers for the electrification of road transport, addressing specifically the availability of recharging infrastructure.", "Sustainable business model archetypes for the banking industry ": "Sustainable business model innovation is increasingly viewed as a lever for systems change for sustainability across businesses and industries. Banks hold a unique intermediary role in sustainable development, but also have a difficult position after the 2008 financial crisis. This paper aims to explore business models for sustainability in the service industry, particularly banking. It explores the receptiveness of customers towards sustainable business models pursued by banks. The retail banking industry in Hong Kong is the focus of this work. First, a practice review and semi-structured interviews are used to develop and validate a set of sustainable business model archetypes for the banking industry. Second, surveys are conducted to test customer receptiveness for the archetypes. Eight sustainable business model archetypes for banking are developed and validated. \u201cSubstitute with digital processes\u201d, \u201cadopt a stewardship role\u201d and \u201cencourage sufficiency\u201d are most welcomed by customers. Some archetypes seem at direct odds with current business practice, such as \u201cencourage sufficiency\u201d. This study gives an insight to how to \u201cdo good and do well\u201d in the banking industry. Further research on the attributes of these archetypes can be conducted to gain a deeper understanding why customers prefer banks to use these archetypes.", "Climate and environmental science denial: A review of the scientific literature published in 1990\u20132015 ": "Denial of scientific findings is neither a new nor an unexplored phenomenon. In the area of environmental science and policy though, the research on denial has not been systematically summarized and analyzed. This article reviews 161 scientific articles on environmental and climate science denial published in peer reviewed international journals in the last 25 years and aims to both identify research gaps and enable learning on the phenomenon. Such knowledge is needed for the increasingly important task to provide effective response to science denial, in order to put an end to its influence on environmental policy making. The review, which is based on articles found in the databases Web of Science, Scopus and Philosopher's Index, shows that denial by far is most studied in relation to climate change, with a focus on Anglo-American countries, where this form of denial is most common. Other environmental issues and other geographical areas have received much less scientific attention. While the actors behind climate science denial, their various motives and the characteristics of their operations have been thoroughly described, more comparative research between issues and countries is needed in order to draw reliable conclusions about the factors explaining the peculiarities of denial. This may in turn lay the ground for developing and actually testing the effectiveness and efficiency of strategies to counter environmental science denial. Irrespective of the ambitions of environmental goals, science-based policies are always preferable. The scientific community therefore needs to increase its efforts to dismantle false claims and to disclose the schemes of denialists.", "A review of Internet of Things for smart home: Challenges and solutions ": "Although Internet of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability. We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home solutions.", "Indoor air humidity, air quality, and health \u2013 An overview ": "There is a long-standing dispute about indoor air humidity and perceived indoor air quality (IAQ) and associated health effects. Complaints about sensory irritation in eyes and upper airways are generally among top-two symptoms together with the perception \u201cdry air\u201d in office environments. This calls for an integrated analysis of indoor air humidity and eye and airway health effects. This overview has reviewed the literature about the effects of extended exposure to low humidity on perceived IAQ, sensory irritation symptoms in eyes and airways, work performance, sleep quality, virus survival, and voice disruption. Elevation of the indoor air humidity may positively impact perceived IAQ, eye symptomatology, and possibly work performance in the office environment; however, mice inhalation studies do not show exacerbation of sensory irritation in the airways by low humidity. Elevated humidified indoor air appears to reduce nasal symptoms in patients suffering from obstructive apnea syndrome, while no clear improvement on voice production has been identified, except for those with vocal fatigue. Both low and high RH, and perhaps even better absolute humidity (water vapor), favors transmission and survival of influenza virus in many studies, but the relationship between temperature, humidity, and the virus and aerosol dynamics is complex, which in the end depends on the individual virus type and its physical/chemical properties. Dry and humid air perception continues to be reported in offices and in residential areas, despite the IAQ parameter \u201cdry air\u201d (or \u201cwet/humid air\u201d) is semantically misleading, because a sensory organ for humidity is non-existing in humans. This IAQ parameter appears to reflect different perceptions among other odor, dustiness, and possibly exacerbated by desiccation effect of low air humidity.\n                  It is salient to distinguish between indoor air humidity (relative or absolute) near the breathing and ocular zone and phenomena caused by moisture-damage of the building construction and emissions therefrom. Further, residential versus public environments should be considered as separate entities with different characteristics and demands of humidity. Research is needed about particle, bacteria and virus dynamics indoors for improvement of quality of life and with more focus on the impact of absolute humidity. \u201cDry (or wet) air\u201d should be redefined to become a meaningful IAQ descriptor.", "Firefighters' and instructors\u2019 absorption of PAHs and benzene during training exercises ": "Introduction\n                  Training fires may constitute a major portion of some firefighters\u2019 occupational exposures to smoke. However, the magnitude and composition of those exposures are not well understood and may vary by the type of training scenario and fuels.\n               \n               \n                  Objectives\n                  To understand how structure fire training contributes to firefighters' and instructors\u2019 select chemical exposures, we conducted biological monitoring during exercises involving combustion of pallet and straw and oriented strand board (OSB) or the use of simulated smoke.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Urine was analyzed for metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and breath was analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Median concentrations of nearly all PAH metabolites in urine increased from pre-to 3-hr post-training for each scenario and were highest for OSB, followed by pallet and straw, and then simulated smoke. For instructors who supervised three trainings per day, median concentrations increased at each collection. A single day of OSB exercises led to a 30-fold increase in 1-hydroxypyrene for instructors, culminating in a median end-of-shift concentration 3.5-fold greater than median levels measured from firefighters in a previous controlled-residential fire study. Breath concentrations of benzene increased 2 to 7-fold immediately after the training exercises (with the exception of simulated smoke training). Exposures were highest for the OSB scenario and instructors accumulated PAHs with repeated daily exercises.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Dermal absorption likely contributed to the biological levels as the respiratory route was well protected. Training academies should consider exposure risks as well as instructional objectives when selecting training exercises.", "A Faecal Contamination Index for interpreting heterogeneous diarrhoea impacts of water, sanitation and hygiene interventions and overall, regional and country estimates of community sanitation coverage with a focus on low- and middle-income countries ": "Objectives\n                  The impact on diarrhoea of sanitation interventions has been heterogeneous. We hypothesize that this is due to the level of prevailing faecal environmental contamination and propose a Faecal Contamination Index (FAECI) of selected WASH indicators (objective 1). Additionally, we provide estimates of the proportion of the population living in communities above certain sanitation coverage levels (objective 2).\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  \n                     Objective 1: Faecal contamination post-intervention was estimated from WASH intervention reports.

The association between the estimated level of faecal environmental contamination and diarrhoea was examined using meta-regression. Objective 2: A literature search was conducted to identify health-relevant community sanitation coverage thresholds. To estimate total community coverage with basic sanitation in low- and middle-income countries, at relevant thresholds, household surveys with data available at primary sampling unit (PSU)-level were analysed according to the identified thresholds, at country-, regional- and overall level.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  \n                     Objective 1: We found a non-linear association between estimated environmental faecal contamination and sanitation interventions\u2019 impact on diarrhoeal disease. Diarrhoea reductions were highest at lower faecal contamination levels, and no diarrhoea reduction was found when contamination increased above a certain level. Objective 2: Around 45% of the population lives in communities with more than 75% of coverage with basic sanitation and 24% of the population lives in communities above 95% coverage, respectively.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  High prevailing faecal contamination might explain interventions' poor effectiveness in reducing diarrhoea. The here proposed Faecal Contamination Index is a first attempt to estimate the level of faecal contamination in communities. Much of the world's population currently lives in faecally contaminated environments as indicated by low community sanitation coverage.", "Burden of disease from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene for selected adverse health outcomes: An updated analysis with a focus on low- and middle-income countries ": "Background\n                  To develop updated estimates in response to new exposure and exposure-response data of the burden of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, malnutrition, schistosomiasis, malaria, soil-transmitted helminth infections and trachoma from exposure to inadequate drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours (WASH) with a focus on low- and middle-income countries.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  For each of the analysed diseases, exposure levels with both sufficient global exposure data for 2016 and a matching exposure-response relationship were combined into population-attributable fractions. Attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated for each disease and, for most of the diseases, by country, age and sex group separately for inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours and for the cluster of risk factors. Uncertainty estimates were computed on the basis of uncertainty surrounding exposure estimates and relative risks.\n               \n               \n                  Findings\n                  An estimated 829,000 WASH-attributable deaths and 49.8 million DALYs occurred from diarrhoeal diseases in 2016, equivalent to 60% of all diarrhoeal deaths. In children under 5 years, 297,000 WASH-attributable diarrhoea deaths occurred, representing 5.3% of all deaths in this age group. If the global disease burden from different diseases and several counterfactual exposure distributions was combined it would amount to 1.6 million deaths, representing 2.8% of all deaths, and 104.6 million DALYs in 2016.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Despite recent declines in attributable mortality, inadequate WASH remains an important determinant of global disease burden, especially among young children. These estimates contribute to global monitoring such as for the Sustainable Development Goal indicator on mortality from inadequate WASH.", "The impact of sanitation on infectious disease and nutritional status: A systematic review and meta-analysis ": "Background\n                  Sanitation aims to sequester human feces and prevent exposure to fecal pathogens. More than 2.4 billion people worldwide lack access to improved sanitation facilities and almost one billion practice open defecation. We undertook systematic reviews and meta-analyses to compile the most recent evidence on the impact of sanitation on diarrhea, soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and nutritional status assessed using anthropometry.\n               \n               \n                  Methods and findings\n                  We updated previously published reviews by following their search strategy and eligibility criteria. We searched from the previous review\u2019s end date to December 31, 2015. We conducted meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect using random-effects models and conducted subgroup analyses to assess impact of different levels of sanitation services and to explore sources of heterogeneity. We assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence from intervention studies using the Liverpool Quality Appraisal Tool (LQAT) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, respectively. A total of 171 studies met the review\u2019s inclusion criteria, including 64 studies not included in the previous reviews. Overall, the evidence suggests that sanitation is protective against diarrhea, active trachoma, some STH infections, schistosomiasis, and height-for-age, with no protective effect for other anthropometric outcomes. The evidence was generally of poor quality, heterogeneity was high, and GRADE scores ranged from very low to high.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  This review confirms positive impacts of sanitation on aspects of health. Evidence gaps remain and point to the need for research that rigorously describes sanitation implementation and type of sanitation interventions.", "Towards 5G communication systems: Are there health implications? ": "The spread of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) is rising and health effects are still under investigation. RF-EMF promote oxidative stress, a condition involved in cancer onset, in several acute and chronic diseases and in vascular homeostasis. Although some evidences are still controversial, the WHO IARC classified RF-EMF as \u201cpossible carcinogenic to humans\u201d, and more recent studies suggested reproductive, metabolic and neurologic effects of RF-EMF, which are also able to alter bacterial antibiotic resistance. In this evolving scenario, although the biological effects of 5G communication systems are very scarcely investigated, an international action plan for the development of 5G networks has started, with a forthcoming increment in devices and density of small cells, and with the future use of millimeter waves (MMW). Preliminary observations showed that MMW increase skin temperature, alter gene expression, promote cellular proliferation and synthesis of proteins linked with oxidative stress, inflammatory and metabolic processes, could generate ocular damages, affect neuro-muscular dynamics. Further studies are needed to better and independently explore the health effects of RF-EMF in general and of MMW in particular. However, available findings seem sufficient to demonstrate the existence of biomedical effects, to invoke the precautionary principle, to define exposed subjects as potentially vulnerable and to revise existing limits. An adequate knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms linking RF-EMF exposure to health risk should also be useful in the current clinical practice, in particular in consideration of evidences pointing to extrinsic factors as heavy contributors to cancer risk and to the progressive epidemiological growth of noncommunicable diseases.", "Human biomonitoring in health risk assessment in Europe: Current practices and recommendations for the future ": "Human biomonitoring (HBM) is an important tool to survey the internal exposure of humans which represents the real life chemical body burden to chemicals and/or their metabolites. It results from total exposure to chemical substances from different sources and via different routes. These substances may be regulated under different legislative frameworks on chemicals (e.g., environmental, occupational, food safety etc). In occupational health, HBM has long traditions to control the exposures at workplaces. By providing accurate data on internal exposure, HBM data can improve human health risk assessment (RA) for both the general population and workers. Although the past few years have shown good examples on the use of HBM in the RA of chemicals, there is still quite some work to be done to improve its use in a regulatory RA.\n                  Under the scope of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (project HBM4EU, 2017\u20132021), the current study reviews the state-of-the-art of HBM use in chemicals RA with a special focus in Europe, and attempts to identify hurdles and challenges faced by regulators. To gather information on the use of HBM, including the availability of guidance on how to use it in RA, the RA schemes applied by different European or international organizations were analysed. Examples of such use were identified for a few selected groups of chemicals of concern for human health. In addition, we present the results of a survey, aimed at collecting information from national regulatory risk assessors on their day-to-day RA practices, the use of HBM data, and the obstacles and challenges related to their use. The results evidenced and explained some of the current obstacles of using HBM data in RA. These included the lack of HBM guidance values or biomonitoring equivalents (BEs), limited toxicokinetic information to support the interpretation of HBM data and, in the occupational health and safety (OSH) field, the lack of legal enforcement. Therefore, to support the integration of HBM in regulatory RA, we recommend, on one hand, the elaboration of a EU level guidance on the use of HBM in RA and, on the other hand, the continuation of research efforts to integrate HBM with new RA approaches using in vitro/in silico data and Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs).", "Correlation of volatile carbonyl yields emitted by e-cigarettes with the temperature of the heating coil and the perceived sensorial quality of the generated vapours ": "E-liquids generally contain four main components: nicotine, flavours, water and carrier liquids. The carrier liquid dissolves flavours and nicotine and vaporises at a certain temperature on the atomizer of the e-cigarette. Propylene glycol and glycerol, the principal carriers used in e-liquids, undergo decomposition in contact with the atomizer heating-coil forming volatile carbonyls. Some of these, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein, are of concern due to their adverse impact on human health when inhaled at sufficient concentrations. The aim of this study was to correlate the yield of volatile carbonyls emitted by e-cigarettes with the temperature of the heating coil.\n                  For this purpose, a popular commercial e-liquid was machine-vaped on a third generation e-cigarette which allowed the variation of the output wattage (5\u201325W) and therefore the heat generated on the atomizer heating-coil. The temperature of the heating-coil was determined by infrared thermography and the vapour generated at each temperature underwent subjective sensorial quality evaluation by an experienced vaper.\n                  A steep increase in the generated carbonyls was observed when applying a battery-output of at least 15W corresponding to 200\u2013250\u00b0C on the heating coil. However, when considering concentrations in each inhaled puff, the short-term indoor air guideline value for formaldehyde was already exceeded at the lowest wattage of 5W, which is the wattage applied in most 2nd generation e-cigarettes. Concentrations of acetaldehyde in each puff were several times below the short-term irritation threshold value for humans. Acrolein was only detected from 20W upwards. The negative sensorial quality evaluation by the volunteering vaper of the vapour generated at 20W demonstrated the unlikelihood that such a wattage would be realistically set by a vaper. This study highlights the importance to develop standardised testing methods for the assessment of carbonyl-emissions and emissions of other potentially harmful compounds from e-cigarettes. The wide variety and variability of products available on the market make the development of such methods and the associated standardised testing conditions particularly demanding.", "Glyphosate in German adults \u2013 Time trend (2001 to 2015) of human exposure to a widely used herbicide ": "The broadband herbicide glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl]-glycine) and its main metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were analyzed by GC-MS-MS in 24h-urine samples cryo-archived by the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB). Samples collected in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 were chosen for this retrospective analysis. All urine samples had been provided by 20 to 29 years old individuals living in Greifswald, a city in north-eastern Germany. Out of the 399 analyzed urine samples, 127 (=31.8%) contained glyphosate concentrations at or above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.1\u03bcg/L. For AMPA this was the case for 160 (=40.1%) samples. The fraction of glyphosate levels at or above LOQ peaked in 2012 (57.5%) and 2013 (56.4%) after having discontinuously increased from 10.0% in 2001. Quantification rates were lower again in 2014 and 2015 with 32.5% and 40.0%, respectively. The overall trend for quantifiable AMPA levels was similar. Glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in urine were statistically significantly correlated (spearman rank correlation coefficient=0.506, p\u22640.001). Urinary glyphosate and AMPA levels tended to be higher in males. The possible reduction in exposure since 2013 indicated by ESB data may be due to changes in glyphosate application in agricultural practice. The ESB will continue monitoring internal exposures to glyphosate and AMPA for following up the time trend, elucidating inter-individual differences, and contributing to the ongoing debate on the further regulation of glyphosate-based pesticides.", "The impact of sanitation interventions on latrine coverage and latrine use: A systematic review and meta-analysis ": "Background\n                  An estimated 2.4 billion people still lack access to improved sanitation and 946 million still practice open defecation. The World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned this review to assess the impact of sanitation on coverage and use, as part of its effort to develop a set of guidelines on sanitation and health.\n               \n               \n                  Methods and findings\n                  We systematically reviewed the literature and used meta-analysis to quantitatively characterize how different sanitation interventions impact latrine coverage and use. We also assessed both qualitative and quantitative studies to understand how different structural and design characteristics of sanitation are associated with individual latrine use. A total of 64 studies met our eligibility criteria. Of 27 intervention studies that reported on household latrine coverage and provided a point estimate with confidence interval, the average increase in coverage was 14% (95% CI: 10%, 19%). The intervention types with the largest absolute increases in coverage included the Indian government's \u201cTotal Sanitation Campaign\u201d (27%; 95% CI: 14%, 39%), latrine subsidy/provision interventions (16%; 95% CI: 8%, 24%), latrine subsidy/provision interventions that also incorporated education components (17%; 95% CI: \u22125%, 38%), sewerage interventions (14%; 95% CI: 1%, 28%), sanitation education interventions (14%; 95% CI: 3%, 26%), and community-led total sanitation interventions (12%; 95% CI: \u22122%, 27%). Of 10 intervention studies that reported on household latrine use, the average increase was 13% (95% CI: 4%, 21%). The sanitation interventions and contexts in which they were implemented varied, leading to high heterogeneity across studies. We found 24 studies that examined the association between structural and design characteristics of sanitation facilities and facility use. These studies reported that better maintenance, accessibility, privacy, facility type, cleanliness, newer latrines, and better hygiene access were all frequently associated with higher use, whereas poorer sanitation conditions were associated with lower use.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Our results indicate that most sanitation interventions only had a modest impact on increasing latrine coverage and use. A further understanding of how different sanitation characteristics and sanitation interventions impact coverage and use is essential in order to more effectively attain sanitation access for all, eliminate open defecation, and ultimately improve health.", "Burden of climate change on malaria mortality ": "In 2016, an estimated 445,000 deaths and 216 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide, while 70% of the deaths occurred in children under five years old. Changes in climatic exposures such as temperature and precipitation make malaria one of the most climate sensitive outcomes. Using a global malaria mortality dataset for 105 countries between 1980 and 2010, we find a non-linear relationship between temperature and malaria mortality and estimate that the global optimal temperature threshold beyond which all-age malaria mortality increases is 20.8\u202f\u00b0C, while in the case of child mortality; a significantly lower optimum temperature of 19.3\u00b0 is estimated. Our results also suggest that this optimal temperature is 28.4\u202f\u00b0C and 26.3\u202f\u00b0C in Africa and Asia, respectively \u2013 the continents where malaria is most prevalent. Furthermore, we estimate that child mortality (ages 0\u20134) is likely to increase by up to 20% in some areas due to climate change by the end of the 21st century.", "Environmental conditions in health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries: Coverage and inequalities ": "Safe environmental conditions and the availability of standard precaution items are important to prevent and treat infection in health care facilities (HCFs) and to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets for health and water, sanitation, and hygiene. Baseline coverage estimates for HCFs have yet to be formed for the SDGs; and there is little evidence describing inequalities in coverage. To address this, we produced the first coverage estimates of environmental conditions and standard precaution items in HCFs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); and explored factors associated with low coverage. Data from monitoring reports and peer-reviewed literature were systematically compiled; and information on conditions, service levels, and inequalities tabulated. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with low coverage. Data for 21 indicators of environmental conditions and standard precaution items were compiled from 78 LMICs which were representative of 129,557 HCFs. 50% of HCFs lack piped water, 33% lack improved sanitation, 39% lack handwashing soap, 39% lack adequate infectious waste disposal, 73% lack sterilization equipment, and 59% lack reliable energy services. Using nationally representative data from six countries, 2% of HCFs provide all four of water, sanitation, hygiene, and waste management services. Statistically significant inequalities in coverage exist between HCFs by: urban-rural setting, managing authority, facility type, and sub-national administrative unit. We identified important, previously undocumented inequalities and environmental health challenges faced by HCFs in LMICs. The information and analyses provide evidence for those engaged in improving HCF conditions to develop evidence-based policies and efficient programs, enhance service delivery systems, and make better use of available resources.", "Human biomonitoring reference values for metals and trace elements in blood and urine derived from the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007\u20132013 ": "Human biomonitoring reference values are statistical estimates that indicate the upper margin of background exposure to a given chemical at a given time. Nationally representative human biomonitoring data on 176 chemicals, including several metals and trace elements, are available in Canada from 2007 to 2013 through the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS). In this work, we used a systematic approach based on the reference interval concept proposed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry to derive reference values (RV95s) for metals and trace elements. These RV95s were derived for blood and urine matrices in the general Canadian population based on the latest biomonitoring data from the CHMS. Biomarkers were chosen based on specific selection criteria, including widespread detection in Canadians (\u226566% detection rate). Reference populations were created for each biomarker by applying appropriate exclusion criteria. Age and sex were evaluated as possible partitioning criteria and separate RV95s were derived for the sub-populations in cases where partitioning was deemed necessary. The RV95s for metals and trace elements in blood ranged from 0.18\u03bcg/L for cadmium in young children aged 3\u20135 years to 7900\u03bcg/L for zinc in males aged 20\u201379 years. In the case of urinary biomarkers, the RV95s ranged from 0.17\u03bcg/L for antimony in the total population aged 3\u201379 years to 1400mg/L for fluoride in adults aged 20\u201379 years. These RV95s represent the first set of reference values for metals and trace elements in the general Canadian population. We compare the RV95s from other countries where available and discuss factors that could influence such comparisons.", "Capacity building and training approaches for water safety plans: A comprehensive literature review ": "The World Health Organization has recommended Water Safety Plans (WSPs), a holistic risk assessment and risk management approach, for drinking-water suppliers across low-, middle- and high-income countries, since publishing its 2004 Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality. While rapid WSP adoption has occurred, capacity is still catching up to implementation needs. Many countries and regions lack case examples, legal requirements, and training resources for WSPs, corresponding to widespread capacity shortfall in the water supply sector. We undertook a comprehensive review of the literature on capacity building and training for WSPs, with the goal of providing recommendations for multiple stakeholder groups at the scales of individual utilities, national governments, and intermediate units of governance. We propose a WSP training taxonomy and discuss it in relation to the stages of learning (introduction, practice, and reinforcement); describe the importance of customizing training to the target group, local language and circumstances; highlight the relevance of auditing for evaluating change over time; and call for robust methods to monitor WSP capacity development.", "Long-term persistence of infectious Legionella with free-living amoebae in drinking water biofilms ": "Prolific growth of pathogenic Legionella pneumophila within engineered water systems and premise plumbing, and human exposure to aerosols containing this bacterium results in the leading health burden of any water-related pathogen in developed regions. Ecologically, free-living amoebae (FLA) are an important group of the microbial community that influence biofilm bacterial diversity in the piped-water environment. Using fluorescent microscopy, we studied in-situ the colonization of L. pneumophila in the presence of two water-related FLA species, Willaertia magna and Acanthamoeba polyphaga in drinking water biofilms. During water flow as well as after periods of long-stagnation, the attachment and colonization of L. pneumophila to predeveloped water-biofilm was limited. Furthermore, W. magna and A. polyphaga showed no immediate interactions with L. pneumophila when introduced to the same natural biofilm environment. A. polyphaga encysted within 5\u20137\u202fd after introduction to the tap-water biofilms and mostly persisted in cysts till the end of the study period (850\u202fd). W. magna trophozoites, however, exhibited a time delay in feeding on Legionella and were observed with internalized L. pneumophila cells after 3 weeks from their introduction to the end of the study period and supported putative (yet limited) intracellular growth. The culturable L. \n                     pneumophila in the bulk water was reduced by 2-log over 2\u202fyears\u202fat room temperature but increased (without a change in mip gene copies by qPCR) when the temperature was elevated to 40\u202f\u00b0C within the same closed-loop tap-water system without the addition of nutrients or fresh water. The overall results suggest that L. pneumophila maintains an ecological balance with FLA within the biofilm environment, and higher temperature improve the viability of L. pneumophila cells, and intracellular growth of Legionella is possibly cell-concentration dependent. Observing the preferential feeding behavior, we hypothesize that an initial increase of FLA numbers through feeding on a range of other available bacteria could lead to an enrichment of L. pneumophila, and later force predation of Legionella by the amoeba trophozoites results in rapid intracellular replication, leading to problematic concentration of L. pneumophila in water. In order to find sustainable control options for legionellae and various other saprozoic, amoeba-resisting bacterial pathogens, this work emphasizes the need for better understanding of the FLA feeding behavior and the range of ecological interactions impacting microbial population dynamics within engineered water systems.", "A systematic review of the public health risks of bioaerosols from intensive farming ": "Background\n                  Population growth, increasing food demands, and economic efficiency have been major driving forces behind farming intensification over recent decades. However, biological emissions (bioaerosols) from intensified livestock farming may have the potential to impact human health. Bioaerosols from intensive livestock farming have been reported to cause symptoms and/or illnesses in occupational-settings and there is concern about the potential health effects on people who live near the intensive farms. As well as adverse health effects, some potential beneficial effects have been attributed to farm exposures in early life. The aim of the study was to undertake a systematic review to evaluate potential for adverse health outcomes in populations living near intensive livestock farms.\n               \n               \n                  Material and methods\n                  Two electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) and bibliographies were searched for studies reporting associations between health outcomes and bioaerosol emissions related to intensive farming published between January 1960 and April 2017, including both occupational and community studies. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using a customized score.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  38 health studies met the inclusion criteria (21 occupational and 1 community study measured bioaerosol concentrations, 16 community studies using a proxy measure for exposure). The majority of occupational studies found a negative impact on respiratory health outcomes and increases in inflammatory biomarkers among farm workers exposed to bioaerosols. Studies investigating the health of communities living near intensive farms had mixed findings. All four studies of asthma in children found increased reported asthma prevalence among children living or attending schools near an intensive farm. Papers principally investigated respiratory and immune system outcomes.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The review indicated a potential impact of intensive farming on childhood respiratory health, based on a small number of studies using self-reported outcomes, but supported by findings from occupational studies. Further research is needed to measure and monitor exposure in community settings and relate this to objectively measured health outcomes.", "Including aspects of climate change into water safety planning: Literature review of global experience and case studies from Ethiopian urban supplies ": "In recent years, the water safety plan approach has been extended towards climate-resilient water safety planning. This happened in response to increasing insight into impacts of climate on drinking-water and required adaptation to anticipated climate change. Literature was reviewed for published guidance and case examples, documenting how to consider climate in water safety planning to support future uptake. Climate-resilient water safety plans were piloted within a project in the water supplies of Addis Ababa and Adama, Ethiopia.\n                  Case examples have been published in four of six WHO regions with a focus on urban supplies. Integration of climate aspects focused mostly on the steps of establishing the team, system description, hazard analysis and risk assessment, improvement planning and development of management procedures. While the traditional framework focuses on drinking-water quality, considering climate change augments aspects of water quantity. Therefore, other factors affecting water quantity such as population development and demand of other sectors need to be considered as well. Local climate information and tools should be employed as a significant success factor for future uptake. Such information should be incorporated as it becomes available, and may \u2013 depending on the setting \u2013 be incrementally integrated into existing water safety plans or used to develop new ones.", "Outdoor blue spaces, human health and well-being: A systematic review of quantitative studies ": "Background\n                  A growing number of quantitative studies have investigated the potential benefits of outdoor blue spaces (lakes, rivers, sea, etc) and human health, but there is not yet a systematic review synthesizing this evidence.\n               \n               \n                  Objectives\n                  To systematically review the current quantitative evidence on human health and well-being benefits of outdoor blue spaces.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Following PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis, observational and experimental quantitative studies focusing on both residential and non-residential outdoor blue space exposure were searched using specific keywords.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  In total 35 studies were included in the current systematic review, most of them being classified as of \u201cgood quality\u201d (N=22).

In only one city, hospital wastewater was treated on-site using advanced technologies, including membrane bioreactor treatment (MBR), ozonation, granulated activated carbon (GAC) and UV-treatment.\n                  On-site hospital wastewater (HWW) treatment reduced gene presence of hospital-related antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic concentrations in the receiving urban wastewater treatment plant. These findings support the need for on-site treatment of high-risk point sources of antibiotic resistance genes.\n                  13 antibiotic resistance genes, Integrase Class 1 and 16S rRNA concentrations were quantified using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays and the presence and/or concentration of 711 antibiotics were analyzed.\n                  Hospital wastewater contained approximately 25% more antibiotics and gene concentrations between 0.4 log to 1.8-fold higher than communal wastewater (CWW). bla\n                     KPC and vanA could be identified as hospital-related genes and were reduced to under the limit of detection (LOD) during on-site treatment. Advanced on-site treatment removed between 0.5 and 3.6-fold more genes than conventional biological urban wastewater treatment (activated sludge). Advanced on-site treatment was able to eliminate 12 out of 19 detected antibiotics, while urban waste water treatment eliminated up to 1 (out of 21 detected). Different advanced treatment technologies were able to target different pollutants to varying extents, making sequential alignment more effective. MBR treatment was most efficient in antibiotic resistance gene reduction and ozonation in antibiotic reduction.\n                  \n                     bla\n                     KPC could only be detected in the influent of the urban wastewater treatment plant receiving untreated hospital wastewater. Similarly, vanA was only consistently detected in this treatment plant. These results indicate a positive effect of on-site treatment of hospital wastewater on the communal sewage system.", "Pathogens transmitted in animal feces in low- and middle-income countries ": "Animals found in close proximity to humans in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) harbor many pathogens capable of infecting humans, transmissible via their feces. Contact with animal feces poses a currently unquantified\u2014though likely substantial\u2014risk to human health. In LMIC settings, human exposure to animal feces may explain some of the limited success of recent water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions that have focused on limiting exposure to human excreta, with less attention to containing animal feces.\n                  We conducted a review to identify pathogens that may substantially contribute to the global burden of disease in humans through their spread in animal feces in the domestic environment in LMICs. Of the 65 potentially pathogenic organisms considered, 15 were deemed relevant, based on burden of disease and potential for zoonotic transmission. Of these, five were considered of highest concern based on a substantial burden of disease for which transmission in animal feces is potentially important: Campylobacter, non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), Lassa virus, Cryptosporidium, and Toxoplasma gondii. Most of these have a wide range of animal hosts, except Lassa virus, which is spread through the feces of rats indigenous to sub-Saharan Africa. Combined, these five pathogens cause close to one million deaths annually. More than half of these deaths are attributed to invasive NTS. We do not estimate an overall burden of disease from improperly managed animal feces in LMICs, because it is unknown what proportion of illnesses caused by these pathogens can be attributed to contact with animal feces.\n                  Typical water quantity, water quality, and handwashing interventions promoted in public health and development address transmission routes for both human and animal feces; however, sanitation interventions typically focus on containing human waste, often neglecting the residual burden of disease from pathogens transmitted via animal feces. This review compiles evidence on which pathogens may contribute to the burden of disease through transmission in animal feces; these data will help prioritize intervention types and regions that could most benefit from interventions aimed at reducing human contact with animal feces.", "Increased cancers among residents living in the neighborhood of a petrochemical complex: A 12-year retrospective cohort study ": "This study investigates whether cancers are increased for residents living in the vicinity of a petrochemical complex with coal power plants and refineries. We recruited a residential cohort of 2388 long-term residents aged above 35 years in 2009\u20132012 who lived within a 40\u202fkm radius of the complex. We measured their internal exposure biomarkers of urinary carcinogenic metals and retrospectively compared cancer incidences between those who lived fewer than 10\u202fkm from the complex (high exposure, HE) and those who lived more than 10\u202fkm from the complex (low exposure, LE). Residents had lived in their respective areas for 12 years, since the complex began operating in mid-1999. This included two periods of operation: 0\u20139 years and 10\u201312 years. Crude cumulative incident rates (CIRs) of all cancers were calculated for new cancer cases (ICD-9: 140\u2013165, 170\u2013176, 179\u2013208) recorded in the Taiwan Health Insurance Database over total person-years at risk in each study period. Poisson regression was applied to estimate relative risks for the CIRs of all cancers between HE and LE areas during the 10\u201312 years since the beginning of the complex\u2019s operation, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, hepatitis C, and occupational exposure. We found that our study subjects in HE areas had higher urinary carcinogenic metal levels, including As, Cd, Hg, Pb, and V, and higher prevalence rates of hepatitis C than those in LE areas. After the complex had been operating for 10\u201312 years, SIRs per 1000 person-years for all cancers in HE and LE areas were 4.44 vs. 2.48 for all subjects, 15.2 vs. 4.86 for elder subjects aged above 60 years, and 2.94 vs. 2.71 for female subjects. Correspondingly, the adjusted relative risks of CIRs for all cancers between HE and LE areas were 1.29 (95% CI: 0.99\u20131.68) for all subjects, 1.52 (1.04\u20132.22) for elder subjects, 1.41 (1.00\u20131.97) for female subjects, and 1.91 (1.15\u20133.19) for female elderly subjects. We conclude that elder and female residents living within 10\u202fkm of a petrochemical complex had higher carcinogenic exposure and cancers than those living farther away from the complex after the complex had been operating for 10 years.", "The exposome in practice: Design of the EXPOsOMICS project ": "EXPOsOMICS is a European Union funded project that aims to develop a novel approach to the assessment of exposure to high priority environmental pollutants, by characterizing the external and the internal components of the exposome. It focuses on air and water contaminants during critical periods of life. To this end, the project centres on 1) exposure assessment at the personal and population levels within existing European short and long-term population studies, exploiting available tools and methods which have been developed for personal exposure monitoring (PEM); and 2) multiple \u201comic\u201d technologies for the analysis of biological samples (internal markers of external exposures). The search for the relationships between external exposures and global profiles of molecular features in the same individuals constitutes a novel advancement towards the development of \u201cnext generation exposure assessment\u201d for environmental chemicals and their mixtures. The linkage with disease risks opens the way to what are defined here as \u2018exposome-wide association studies\u2019 (EWAS).", "How current risk assessment and risk management methods for drinking water in The Netherlands cover the WHO water safety plan approach ": "In the Netherlands, safe and sufficient drinking water is provided to the general population by ten drinking water companies. To guarantee safe drinking water the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a Water Safety Plan (WSP), a Risk Assessment and a Risk Management (RA/RM) framework. The objective of the study was to identify legally required RA approaches, to document application of RA/RM activities at Dutch drinking water companies and to determine to what extent these RA/RM activities as a whole cover all the elements of the WHO WSP approach. This study could be of interest to both managers of large water utilities and decision makers.\n                  The assessment was performed by means of a policy review and interviews with two to four staff members involved in RA/RM from all ten Dutch drinking water companies combined with a joint workshop. The drinking water companies are well aware of the potential hazards and risks that can influence the drinking water quality. To guarantee the supply of safe and sufficient drinking water, the Dutch drinking water sector uses six different legally required RA/RM approaches. This study shows that by using the six legally required RA/RM approaches, all WSP steps are covered. WSP entails a generic risk assessment for identifying all hazards and hazardous events from source to tap, whereas the six legally required RA/RM each focus on specific risks at an advanced level. Each risk assessment provides information on specific hazards and hazardous events covering a part of the water supply chain. These legal requirements are complemented with additional RA/RM activities at sector and water company level such as codes of practices and standard operating procedures. The outcomes of all RA/RM approaches combined provide information from source to tap. When using multiple RA/RM approaches, it is crucial to share and combine information derived from the different activities.", "Emerging pollutants in wastewater: A review of the literature ": "For 20 years, many articles report the presence of new compounds, called \u201cemerging compounds\u201d, in wastewater and aquatic environments. The US EPA (United States \u2013 Environmental Protection Agency) defines emerging pollutants as new chemicals without regulatory status and which impact on environment and human health are poorly understood.\n                  The objective of this work was to identify data on emerging pollutants concentrations in wastewater, in influent and effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and to determine the performance of sewage disposal. We collected 44 publications in our database. We sought especially for data on phthalates, Bisphenol A and pharmaceuticals (including drugs for human health and disinfectants). We gathered concentration data and chose 50 pharmaceutical molecules, six phthalates and Bisphenol A. The concentrations measured in the influent ranged from 0.007 to 56.63\u03bcg per liter and the removal rates ranges from 0% (contrast media) to 97% (psychostimulant). Caffeine is the molecule whose concentration in influent was highest among the molecules investigated (in means 56.63\u03bcg per liter) with a removal rate around 97%, leading to a concentration in the effluent that did not exceed 1.77\u03bcg per liter. The concentrations of ofloxacin were the lowest and varied between 0.007 and 2.275\u03bcg per liter in the influent treatment plant and 0.007 and 0.816\u03bcg per liter in the effluent. Among phthalates, DEHP is the most widely used, and quantified by the authors in wastewater, and the rate of removal of phthalates is greater than 90% for most of the studied compounds. The removal rate for antibiotics is about 50% and 71% for Bisphenol A. Analgesics, anti inflammatories and beta-blockers are the most resistant to treatment (30\u201340% of removal rate). Some pharmaceutical molecules for which we have not collected many data and which concentrations seem high as Tetracycline, Codeine and contrast products deserve further research.", "The effectiveness of respiratory protection worn by communities to protect from volcanic ash inhalation. Part I: Filtration efficiency tests ": "During volcanic eruptions and their aftermath, communities may be concerned about the impacts of inhaling volcanic ash. Access to effective respiratory protection (RP) is therefore important for many people in volcanic areas all over the world. However, evidence to support the use of effective RP during such crises is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to build the first evidence base on the effectiveness of common materials used to protect communities from ash inhalation in volcanic crises.\n                  We obtained 17 forms of RP, covering various types of cloth through to disposable masks (typically used in occupational settings), which communities are known to wear during volcanic crises. The RP materials were characterised and subjected to filtration efficiency (FE) tests, which were performed with three challenge dusts: ashes from Sakurajima (Japan) and Soufri\u00e8re Hills (Montserrat) volcanoes and aluminium oxide (Aloxite), chosen as a low-toxicity surrogate dust of similar particle size distribution. FE tests were conducted at two concentrations (1.5\u202fmg/m3 and 2.5\u202fmg/m3) and two flow rates (equivalent to 40 and 80\u202fl/min through 15.9\u202fcm2 sections of each RP type). Each material was held in a sample holder and PM2.5 dust concentrations were measured both outside the mask material and inside the sample holder to determine FE. A limited number of tests were undertaken to assess the effect on FE of wetting a bandana and a surgical mask, as well as folding a bandana to provide multiple filter layers.\n                  Overall, four RP materials performed very well against volcanic ash, with median FEs in excess of 98% (N95-equiv., N99-equiv., PM2.5 surgical (Japan), and Basic flat-fold (Indonesia)). The two standard surgical masks tested had median FEs of 89\u201391%. All other materials had median FEs ranging from 23 to 76% with no cloth materials achieving >44%. Folding a bandana resulted in better FE (40%; 3\u00d7 folded) than single-layered material (29%). Wetting the bandana and surgical mask material did not improve FE overall.\n                  This first evidence base on the FE of common materials used to protect communities in volcanic crises from ash inhalation has been extended in a companion study (Steinle et al., 2018) on the total inward leakage of the best-performing masks when worn by human volunteers. This will provide a complete assessment of the effectiveness of these RP types.", "Use of waste plastic materials for road construction in Ghana ": "This paper forms part of research to solve two main problems in Ghana: firstly, the management of municipal solid waste (MSW), particularly with regards to used plastics which have overwhelmed major cities and towns; secondly, the formation of potholes onroads due to excessive traffic and axle weight. This study examines the effect of blending waste thermoplastic polymers, namely High density polyethylene (HDPE) and Polypropylene (PP) in Conventional AC-20 graded bitumen, at various plastic compositions. The plastics were shredded and blended with the bitumen \u2018in-situ\u2019, with a shear mixer at a temperature range of 160\u00b0C\u2013170\u00b0C. Basic rheological parameters such as penetration, ring & ball softening point and viscosity tests were employed to determine the resulting changes from base bitumen.FTIR spectroscopy was also employed to study the chemical functionalities present in the bitumen composite. The properties of the unmodified bitumen were found to be enhanced with the changes recorded in the rheological properties of the polymer modified bitumen (PMB). It was observed that polypropylene polymer, showed profound effect on homogeneity and compatibility with slight linear increment in the viscosity, softening and penetration values as against relatively high changes for HDPE modified bitumen.The viscosity of unmodified bitumen was enhanced with the addition of the polymers and thixotropic effect was observed for both HDPE and PP at 60\u00b0C. For all modified binders prepared, the penetration values decrease as polymer-bitumen ratio increases whiles softening temperature generally increases as polymer ratio increases. The most compatible and incompatible blends for HDPE were respectively observed at 2% and 3% polymer loading. The most enhanced, homogenous blend is achieved with PP at 3% polymer loading. Three prominent peaks were identified in the spectrum of the unmodified bitumen, occurring at the 3000\u20132850cm\u22121 IR frequency range, typical of aliphatic CH symmetrical and asymmetrical stretches in alkanes. CH2 and CH3 bends were also observed at the characteristic frequencies of 1465cm\u22121 and 1375cm\u22121 respectively. A low intensity peak was observed within the 2400cm\u22121\u20132100cm\u22121 range, indicating the presence of a very weak \u2212CC- or \u2212CN group with an absorbance of precisely 0.12.The use of waste commodity plastics in binder modification carries the advantage of a cheap and effective means of enhancing conventional bitumen binder performance characteristics and is an alternative way to utilise plastic waste.", "Rice husk ash as a partial replacement of cement in high strength concrete containing micro silica: Evaluating durability and mechanical properties ": "The preliminary and inevitable interest in the use of partial replacements or by \u2013 products as complementary pozzolanic materials was mostly induced by enforcement of air pollution control resulted from cement production industry. Rise husk is by- product taken from rice mill process, with approximately the ratio of 200kg per one ton of rice, even in high temperature it reduces to 40kg. This paper presents benefits resulted from various ratios of rice husk ash(RHA) on concrete indicators through 5 mixture plans with proportions of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% RHA by weight of cement in addition to 10% micro- silica (MS) to be compared with a reference mixture with 100% Portland cement. Tests results indicated the positive relationship between 15% replacement of RHA with increase in compressive strengths by about 20%. The optimum level of strength and durability properties generally gain with addition up to 20%, beyond that is associated with slight decrease in strength parameters by about 4.5%. The same results obtained for water absorption ratios likely to be unfavourable. Chloride ions penetration increased with increase in cement replacement by about 25% relative to the initial values (about less than one fifth).", "Ultra-high performance concrete: From fundamental to applications ": "Over the last twenty years, remarkable advances have taken place in the research and application of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), which exhibits excellent rheological behaviors that include workability, self-placing and self-densifying properties, improved in mechanical and durability performance with very high compressive strength, and non-brittleness behavior. It is the \u2018future\u2019 material with the potential to be a viable solution for improving the sustainability of buildings and other infrastructure components. This paper will give an overview of UHPC focusing on its fundamental introduction, design, applications and challenges. After several decades of development, a wide range of commercial UHPC formulations have been developed worldwide to cover an increasing number of applications and the rising demand of quality construction materials. UHPC has several advantages over conventional concrete but the use of it is limited due to the high cost and limited design codes. This paper also aims to help designers, engineers, architects, and infrastructure owners to expand the awareness of UHPC for better acceptance.", "Study of heat of hydration of Portland cement used in Iraq ": "This study aims to obtain the heat generated from cement hydration, effect of chemical properties and curing temperature on heat of hydration.\n                  Ordinary Portland cement used from different plants, which were north (COP-1), middle (COP-2) and south (COP-3) of Iraq. Two water to cement ratios (w\\c) (0.4 & 0.6) and four levels of curing temperature (25\u00b0, 30\u00b0,40\u00b0 and 50\u00b0C) were used.\n                  The experimental results showed that the optimum heat generation from hydration of cement was from (COP-1) cement, then (COP-2) cement and finally (COP-3) cement. Also the causes of variation were discussed.", "Comparison between the falling head and the constant head permeability tests to assess the permeability coefficient of sustainable Pervious Concretes ": "The use of Pervious Concrete (PC) increased in the last years as an alternative to solve the run-off problem. PC shows a high percentage of empty spaces/gaps, which vary from 10 to 35%, facilitating the flow of rain and water through its structure. PC presents higher k permeability coefficient compared to conventional concrete. Permeability is the main property of PC, although there is no standardized method that guarantees the correct and precise measurement of such property in laboratory conditions. Currently, two main methodologies are used to assess the permeability coefficient: the falling head and the constant head permeability tests. In that regard, the American Concrete Institute recommends the use of the first method, although no comparison was done between them. Furthermore, the recommendations do not consider the use of sustainable aggregates during the production of the PC. In this study, the permeability tests were explained and used to assess the permeability coefficient of different mixes of PC produced with sustainable aggregates. The experimental results were used to analyze the relationship between the porosity and the permeability of concrete and compare the performance of the falling head and constant head permeability tests. The study presents the advantages of performing the constant head permeability test to assess the permeability of the PC.", "Mud-concrete block (MCB): mix design & durability characteristics ": "Mud-Concrete is a novel concept which employs a form of \u2018Concrete\u2019 produced using soil, cement and water. The initial concept of developing Mud-Concrete was to incorporate both the strength and durability of concrete into mud-based constructions to introduce a low-cost, load-bearing wall system with easy construction techniques which ensured indoor comfort while minimizing the impact on the environment. Here the fraction of soil is fulfilling the role of aggregate in the material and low quantities of cement will act as a stabilizer. Precisely the usable gravel range and the gravel percentage governs the compressive strength of the material. The considerable high-water amount is used for the hydration of cement and keep the flow of this material. This excessive water amount is enhancing its self-compacting quality, which is capable of self-consolidation, having the ability of passing, filling and being stable without the need of any external forces. Experimental test findings determined the mix proportions of Mud-Concrete block as 4% cement (minimum), fine\u202f\u2264\u202f10% (\u2264\u202fsieve size 0.425\u202fmm), sand 55\u201360% (sieve size 0.425\u202fmm\u202f\u2264\u202fsand \u22644.75\u202fmm), gravel 30\u201335% (sieve size 4.75\u202fmm\u202f\u2264\u202fgravel\u2264 20\u202fmm) and water 18% to 20% from the dry mix. Findings further confirmed that the durability of the Mud-Concrete block satisfied the required durability standards recorded in SLS 1382.", "Environmental impacts of bamboo as a substitute constructional material in Nigeria ": "The environment in Nigeria is exceptionally exposed to diverse natural hazards. Due to this factor, this paper investigates a material which can be substituted for wood or steel in construction. Bamboo, a natural raw material, is one of the fastest growing plants on earth. Bamboo use in construction is not new; it has been regularly utilized for building mud houses and small huts in villages for centuries. Bamboo is a durable and exceptionally flexible building material. It has been utilized for flooring, walls, roofing, concrete reinforcement, and scaffolding, is light in weight and easily transported. This paper will examine bamboo and its environmental benefits, its properties and qualities. In Nigeria, the rate of bamboo use is low; therefore, this paper will investigate bamboo and its uses in Nigeria, conceivable uses that can be embraced demonstrating its accessibility and impacts on the environment in Nigeria.", "Exploiting recycled plastic waste as an alternative binder for paving blocks production ": "The management of solid waste continues to be a major challenge, particularly in the urban agglomeration in low and middle-income countries. One type of solid waste that is of national and global concern is plastic wastes. This study sought to explore the potential of using plastic waste as a binding material for paving blocks production. Concrete paving blocks (cement: quarry dust: sand\u2009=\u20091:1:2) by weight or volume were produced to serve as Control having tested the compressive strength and water absorption properties. Composite paving blocks less in plastic (LP) on a mix ratio of 1:1:2 and high in plastic (HP) on a mix ratio of 1:0.5:1 by weight or volume were also produced and tested in the laboratory for compressive strength at 7, 14, and 21 days curing via water sprinkling and water absorption test were done after the 72\u2009-h of soaking. The study revealed after 21 days old that paving blocks in HP and LP having compressive strengths of 8.53\u2009N/mm2 (water absorption\u2009=\u20090.5%) and 7.31\u2009N/mm2 (water absorption\u2009=\u20092.7%) respectively were higher than the Control value of 6.07\u2009N/mm2 (water absorption\u2009=\u20094.9%). The authors recommended that the paving blocks made from the recycled plastic waste should be used in non-traffic areas such as walkways, footpaths, pedestrian plazas, landscapes, monument premises and in waterlog areas due to their low water absorption property and relatively low compressive strengths compared to global specs thresholds of 5\u201325% and low-density to moderate concrete strength 0.69\u201317.24\u2009N/mm2 respectively.", "Rubber concrete: Mechanical and dynamical properties ": "The purpose of this paper is to report on an experimental study that explores the effect of using recycled rubber powder as an alternate fine aggregate in concrete mixes. Natural sand in the concrete mixes was partially replaced by 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. Physical properties such as the density, the compressive strength, the fresh concrete properties, the split-tension, and the impact load capacity are examined. The results revealed a decrease in the compressive strength of concrete cylinders containing rubber. The dynamic performance of the rubber concrete is of high importance because of its high resilient nature, as the rubber particles that are included in the concrete have a positive effect on the dynamic performance. The conclusions that were derived from this research implicate potential applications where rubberized concrete can be efficiently used. Even though rubberized concrete mixture generally has a reduced compressive strength that may limit its use in certain structural applications, it possesses a number of desirable properties, such as lower density, higher toughness, and higher impact resistance compared to conventional concrete.", "The effect of construction joints on the flexural bending capacity of singly reinforced beams ": "The main purpose of conducting this study is to determine the difference in the bending capacity between a singly reinforced monolithic beam and a singly reinforced beam with a construction joint at the beam center, for a range of different compressive strength (f\u2019c) of concrete. Testing was conducted according to applicable ASTM standards. During humongous construction projects, it is very rare to build a concrete structure without instigating the use of construction joints, whether by design or by de facto forces. On site, the construction supervisor would contemplate whether one could relate the bending capacity of the concrete beam with the use of accidently imposed construction joint. Thus it is very essential to determine the effect the construction joint has on the flexural bending capacity of the concrete. Provided are charts to account for the loss in the bending capacity of singly reinforced beam in the existence of a construction joint for a specific concrete compressive strength.", "Mix design of light-weight self-compacting concrete ": "In recent decades, the utilization of mineral and chemical admixtures in concrete technology has led to changes in the formulation and mix design which has, in turn, made the concrete stronger and more durable. Light weight concrete (LWC) is an excellent solution in terms of decreasing the dead load of the structure, while self-compacting concrete (SCC) eases the pouring and removes construction problems. Combining the advantages of LWC and SCC is a new field of research. Considering its light weight of structure and ease of placement, Light-weight self-compacting concrete (LWSCC) may be the answer to the increasing construction requirements of slender and more heavily reinforced structural elements. Twenty one laboratory experimental investigations on the mix proportion, density and mechanical properties of LWSCC have been published in the last 12 years and these are analyzed in this study. The collected information is used to investigate the mix proportions including the chemical and mineral admixtures, light weight and normal weight aggregates, fillers, cement and water. Analyzed results are presented in terms of statistical expressions. It is very helpful for future research to choose the proper components with different ratios and curing conditions to attain the desired concrete grade according to the planned application.", "Study on polyurethane foamed concrete for use in structural applications ": "Recently, foamed concrete is being widely used in civil construction and building, because of its high fluidity and settlement, low self-weight and low thermal conductivity. However, it has some major setbacks such as low strength and increased shrinkage at later ages. The strength gain of concrete depends upon several variables; one of these is the curing conditions. This work aims to study the potential production of foamed concrete as a sustainable structural material by varying the curing methods. For this purpose, sample cubes, cylinders and prisms were prepared to find the compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and drying shrinkage at different ages. Samples of the polyurethane foamed concrete cured under four different curing regimes (water, moisture, sealing by membrane-forming curing compound and air curing). At the end of the study, polyurethane foamed concrete used for this study has shown the potential for use in structural applications. Also, the results show that the samples cured by moisture have the highest compressive strength at all ages.", "Experimental analysis of Compressed Earth Block (CEB) with banana fibers resisting flexural and compression forces ": "The development of affordable housing is necessary due to the numerous homeless people living in developing countries; the present work is an attempt to alleviate the housing problem facing populations of these countries. Building with Compressed Earthen Blocks (CEBs) is becoming more popular due to their low cost and relative abundance of materials. The proposed innovative Banana-Compressed Earth Block (B-CEB) consists of ordinary CEB ingredients plus banana fibers, which will be the focus of this study. Banana fibers are widely available worldwide due to agricultural waste from banana cultivation. Additionally, banana fibers are environmentally friendly and present important attributes, such as low density, light weight, low cost, high tensile strength, as well as being water repellent and fire resistant. This kind of waste has a greater chance of being utilized for different applications in construction and building materials in order to enhance the mechanical properties of the CEBs. Such enhancements will raise the number of storeys of a building that can be built with CEBs. Experimental work studies on the classic CEB with no fibers and B-CEB were performed, including an axial compression test and flexural test (three-point bending test) by using testing methods according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards (ASTM C-67). Also, in order to obtain the load-deflection curve and bending modulus (E) from the flexural test, the Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) sensor was placed under the mid-span of the block for vertical displacement measurements. The results of this study will highlight general trends in the strength properties of different design mixes by adding different lengths of banana fibers in the CEBs. These efforts are necessary to ensure that B-CEB technology becomes a more widely accepted building material that will verify the earth building technology for offering affordable houses.", "Mix design and properties of fly ash waste lightweight aggregates in structural lightweight concrete ": "Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials and has the ability to consume industrial wastes in high volume. As the demand for concrete is increasing, one of the effective ways to reduce the undesirable environmental impact of the concrete is by the use of waste and by-product materials as cement and aggregate substitutes in concrete. One such waste material is fly ash, which is produced in large quantities from thermal power plants as a by-product. A substantial amount of fly ash is left unused posing environmental and storage problems. The production of sintered lightweight aggregate with fly ash is an effective method to dispose of fly ash in large quantities. Due to lack of a proper mix design procedure, the production and application of lightweight aggregate in structural concrete are not much entertained. The absorption characteristic of lightweight aggregate is a major concern, while developing the mix proportioning of lightweight concretes. The present study is an attempt to establish a new mix design procedure for the development of sintered fly ash lightweight aggregate concretes, which is simple and more reliable than the existing procedures. Also, the proposed methodology has been validated by developing a spectrum of concretes having water cement ratios varying from 0.25 to 0.75. From the study, it is obvious that the development of 70MPa concrete is possible by using cement alone without any additives. Also, it is ensured that all the concretes have densities less than 2000kg/m3.", "Analysis of total chloride content in concrete ": "This research paper presents an analysis of total chloride contents in concrete. The concrete mixtures that were approved by the municipality of Riyadh city in Saudi Arabia for a main ready mix concrete plant were considered in this study. The analysis was based on an experimental investigation of chloride levels in mixing water, aggregates, and concrete. The analysis also used the maximal total chloride limits of British Standards for the concrete in conjunction with other ingredients required for the mix.\n                  The results obtained suggest that the effect of chloride content in mixing water has minimal to moderate influence upon the chloride content of concrete up to w/c equal to 0.4. It also shows that aggregate is the critical ingredient in terms of determining the presence of chloride in concrete. Critically, the limits of chloride content in any concrete mix could be violated even though the limits of chloride content still meet some standards for their content within concrete ingredients. The proportions of any mix design are also an important factor to be considered when attempting to specify the limits of chloride content of the ingredients of concrete mixtures for any type of concrete. It is vital to investigate empirically the relationship between total chloride and chloride contents in ingredients in order to precisely define the limits of chloride content in concrete mix ingredients. Mix design that has the lowest w/c ratio is preferable as far as the chloride content is concerned. Finally, water chloride content could be higher than ASTM specified limits with mix designs that have low water cement ratios and should be lower than the ASTM limits with high water cement ratios.", "Effects of rolling process parameters on the mechanical properties of hot-rolled St60Mn steel ": "This work studied the effect of rolling process parameters at different rolling strain rates, % total deformations and finish rolling temperatures on the mechanical properties of hot-rolled St60Mn steel. The rolling process parameters studied included finish rolling temperature, % total deformation and rolling strain rates. The results were compared with existing literature on rolling carbon steels. The tensile strength, yield strength, hardness, young\u2019s modulus of elasticity, toughness, bendability, % enlongation and % reduction in area of the hot-rolled product were obtained. The results showed that the rolling process parameters remarkably influenced the mechanical properties of St60Mn steel. The trend in property change was dictated by rolling strain rate, % total deformation and finish rolling temperature.\n                  It was concluded that increasing the rolling strain rate from 6.02851\u00d7103s-' to 6.10388\u00d7103s-', using % total deformations of 99% and finish rolling temperature of 958\u00b0C enhanced the mechanical properties of St60Mn steel.", "A survey on problems encountered in current concrete construction and the potential benefits of self-healing cementitious materials ": "The annual costs for repair, maintenance and replacement of civil engineering infrastructure attracts significant expenditure in the UK. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a significant number of existing and new concrete structures suffer from repair and maintenance problems, but a lack of objective construction industry supported data concerning these problems makes it difficult to establish, with any certainty, the actual problems encountered in current concrete construction in the UK. To address this lack of data, a market research exercise was commissioned by the Materials for Life (M4L) EPSRC funded research project. The market research has shown that damage in the form of cracking in concrete structures was experienced by more clients, design team members and civil engineering contractors than any other problem. Structures requiring articulation and subject to dynamic loads such as bridges were noted as being the most vulnerable to damage, with this damage mostly occurring in the joints and half joints, bearings and the deck of such structures. The main consequential effects of damage in concrete structures were the need for the contractor to return for repairs as well as the need for regular monitoring. The current approaches taken to enhance a structure\u2019s longevity mainly involve the use of additional cementitious material to improve the barrier between the environment and the steel reinforcement. However, an alternative could be to use the self-healing cementitious materials that have been proposed by the M4L research team. Until now there has been insufficient evidence regarding how these materials may be deployed in the construction industry, and the applications to which they may be best suited in terms of added-value. The market research results show that highways and infrastructure generally and water retaining structures would benefit most from self-healing cementitious materials, with reduced maintenance costs over a structure\u2019s lifetime justifying a premium in the capital material cost. Reduced whole-life costs and fewer repair and maintenance interventions will have a significant influence on the economic, environmental and social impact of repair and maintenance events, which will be of benefit to the UK as a whole.", "Explanation of the collapse of Terminal 2E at Roissy\u2013CDG Airport by nonlinear deterministic and reliability analyses ": "The collapse of Terminal 2E Roissy at Charles de Gaulle Airport that failed eleven months after its inauguration in 2004 and left four casualties is investigated in this paper by performing deterministic and reliability analyses using the finite element software Ansys. The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of the terminal design by comparing the calculated reinforcement ratio required with the existing ratio and to evaluate the reliability of Terminal 2E to know if the collapse could be predicted during the design phase. Reliability analysis is performed using a combination of Response Surface Method (RSM) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and taking into account the nonlinear properties of material and the complexity of geometry to investigate the nonlinear behavior of the structure in order to reduce computational costs and obtain reliable results. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effects of the uncertainties on the long term deflection in order to investigate the causes of the failure.", "Marine plastic pollution and affordable housing challenge: Shredded waste plastic stabilized soil for producing compressed earth bricks ": "This research work was aimed at investigating the suitability of making compressed earth bricks (CEB) with a mixture of soil and varying percentages (0, 1, 3, and 7%) of shredded waste plastic. Specific gravity, particle size distribution, Atterberg limits and compaction tests were carried out on the soil to determine the engineering properties of the soil. The compressive strengths and erosion rates of the CEB made with the soil and the mixture of soil and varying proportions of shredded waste plastic of two size-categories (<6.3\u2009mm and >9.6\u2009mm) were determined. The soil was classified as clayey sand (SC). The highest compressive strength was obtained for the CEB containing 1% waste plastic of sizes <6.3\u2009mm and its compressive strength amounted to a 244.4% increase. Of the CEB samples stabilized with shredded waste plastic, the sample containing 1% waste plastic of sizes <6.3\u2009mm also had the least erosion rate. Provided the exterior surfaces of walls produced using the CEB are protected from erosion, the use of 1% shredded waste plastic with particle sizes <6.3\u2009mm was recommended. The use of waste plastic that would have constituted an environmental nuisance has the potential to produce stronger and affordable bricks for providing affordable housing.", "The effect of fly ash fineness on heat of hydration, microstructure, flow and compressive strength of blended cement pastes ": "In this paper, an experimental study on the effect of fly ash fineness on the heat of hydration, microstructure, flow and compressive strength of blended cement pastes was carried out and evaluated against control cement paste. Fly ashes with different fineness: classified fly ash, run-of-station fly ash and grounded run-of-station fly ash; with a median particle size of 17.4, 11.3 and 5.7\u2009\u03bcm, respectively, from the same power station source in Australia were used to partially replace Portland cement at 20% and 40% by weight of cement using a fixed water-to-binder ratio of 0.40. Results of this study showed that the cumulative heat of hydration of blended cement paste decreased as fly ash content in blended cement paste was increased. For a given cement replacement level, blended cement paste containing finer fly ash released more heat of hydration when compared to coarser fly ash. Moreover, increasing the fineness of fly ash resulted in a higher consumption of calcium hydroxide at 7 and 28 days reflecting pozzolanic reactivity and, thus, a denser microstructure than blended pastes containing coarser fly ash as revealed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and compressive strength results. In addition, the incorporation of fly ash in the blended pastes led to the introduction of an additional hydration peak in the heat evolution curve possibly due to the late activation of fly ash by calcium hydroxide renewing the C3A reaction and converting ettringite to monosulfate. The flow of the freshly blended cement pastes was also found to improve slightly with increasing fineness of the fly ash. In addition, the hardened blended cement pastes containing 20% ground run-of-station fly ash showed comparable compressive strength with the control cement pastes at both 7 and 28 days mainly due to the higher fineness of the ground run-of-station fly ash and increased reactivity compared to coarser grade fly ash.", "Effect of internal curing on behavior of high performance concrete: An overview ": "This study reviews research experiences on developing an internal curing approach for high-performance concrete (HPC). Common materials have been used to produce the internal curing required to reduce self-desiccation in cement paste and will subsequently reduce the risks of developing cracks in hardened concrete. Furthermore, this study focuses on the behavior of HPC, including density, strength (compressive, splitting tensile, and flexural), shrinkage (autogenous and drying), and microstructure of hydrated cement paste. Results indicate that internal curing is more effective at a later age on splitting tensile and flexural strength than on compressive strength. Internal curing has enabled the interfacial transition zone increasingly compact and dense, thereby enhancing strength.", "Mechanical performance of concrete made of steel fibers from tire waste ": "Currently, the disposal of used tires is a worldwide challenge, due to their non-degradability. Therefore, recycling has become a potential solution for managing such waste. During recycling, materials such as rubber and steel are recovered from the used tires. The use of steel fibres, recovered from tire waste, as a raw material to reinforce concrete is an environmentally friendly and economically viable solution to manage the end-products of tire recycling. Few studies have been carried out to study the behaviour of fibre-reinforced concrete made using steel fibres recovered from tire waste. However, it has been found that there is the potential to reuse steel fibres recovered from tire waste (RF) as an alternative building material to manufactured steel fibres (SF). Nevertheless, more research is needed to verify that the structural performance of recycled fibre reinforced concrete (RFRC) is similar to that of manufactured fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC). Therefore, this study focuses on the laboratory testing of the mechanical properties of RFRC and compares them with those of SFRC. Moreover, the flexural performance of reinforced concrete beams cast with RF and SF have been tested to compare their performance.", "Using PAVER 6.5.7 and GIS program for pavement maintenance management for selected roads in Kerbala city ": "Pavement Maintenance Management System (PMMS) includes systematic actions to get effective management and economic maintenance cost, depending on pavement condition index (PCI). PAVER 6.5.7 software are used to compute PCI values for a selected zone of road network in Kerbala City Center (KCC). Visual inspection survey is conducted to investigate the type, severity level, and extent of failure at sections and sample unites of selected roads. The area under study had 56.8\u202fkm length and contain functionally all types of urban roads. The data collection is achieved for a total of 109 road sections in; 20 Major arterials, 28 Minor arterials, 14 Collectors, and 47 Local sections. Further, the collected data for each section are inventoried and evaluated using PAVER 6.5.7. Also, analysis and prediction of the PCI curve for different sections are determined for different design lives. PAVER 6.5.7 is linked with GIS to layout the results and show the priority for maintenance and rehabilitation for the whole network are established using the critical PCI value.\n                  The resulted PCI indicated that 63% of the network sections of the study area have good condition, 12% have fair condition and 25% have poor condition.", "Impact of marble waste as coarse aggregate on properties of lean cement concrete ": "Marble industry produces large amount of waste during mining and processing stages. This waste is dumped on to open land which creates a lot of environmental problems. The main objective of this study was utilization of marble waste as a replacement for conventional natural coarse aggregate in concrete. Experimental investigations were carried out to examine the feasibility of use of marble waste as a coarse aggregate in concrete. Conventional natural coarse aggregate was replaced by marble aggregate in different percentages 0\u2013100% by weight. The concrete formulations were prepared with a constant water\u2013cement ratio 0.60. It was observed that workability of concrete mixes containing marble aggregate was 14% more than that of control concrete. The average compressive strength of all the concrete mixes containing marble aggregate increased by 40% and 18% at 7 and 28 days, respectively.", "Behaviour and strength assessment of masonry prisms ": "This is a case study presenting the cracking behavior and assessment of the compressive strength of masonry prisms. The compressive strength of masonry was determined by performing laboratory tests on 192 masonry prism specimens corresponding to 3 specimens each in 64 groups. The variables considered in the experimental program are type of brick, strength of masonry and height-to-thickness (h/t) ratio of the prism specimen. Pressed earth bricks and burnt clay bricks were used for the preparation of masonry prisms. A mathematical model is also proposed for the estimation of compressive strength of masonry prisms by performing a statistical multiple regression analysis on 232 data sets, which includes 64 test data from the present study and 168 test data published in the literature. The model was developed based on the regression analysis of test data of prisms made of a variety of masonry units namely clay bricks, pressed earth bricks, concrete blocks, calcium silicate bricks, stone blocks, perforated bricks and soft mud bricks. The proposed model not only accounts for the wide ranges of compressive strengths of masonry unit and mortar, but also accounts for the influence of volume fractions of masonry unit and mortar in addition to the height-to-thickness ratio. The predicted compressive strength of prisms using the proposed model is compared with 14 models available in published literature. The predicted strength was found to be in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data.", "Review of pore network modelling of porous media: Experimental characterisations, network constructions and applications to reactive transport ": "Pore network models have been applied widely for simulating a variety of different physical and chemical processes, including phase exchange, non-Newtonian displacement, non-Darcy flow, reactive transport and thermodynamically consistent oil layers. The realism of such modelling, i.e. the credibility of their predictions, depends to a large extent on the quality of the correspondence between the pore space of a given medium and the pore network constructed as its representation. The main experimental techniques for pore space characterisation, including direct imaging, mercury intrusion porosimetry and gas adsorption, are firstly summarised. A review of the main pore network construction techniques is then presented. Particular focus is given on how such constructions are adapted to the data from experimentally characterised pore systems. Current applications of pore network models are considered, with special emphasis on the effects of adsorption, dissolution and precipitation, as well as biomass growth, on transport coefficients. Pore network models are found to be a valuable tool for understanding and predicting meso-scale phenomena, linking single pore processes, where other techniques are more accurate, and the homogenised continuum porous media, used by engineering community.", "Partitioning of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances from soil to groundwater within aqueous film-forming foam source zones ": "Metadata from on-going site investigations at U.S. Air Force sites impacted by Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) were used to evaluate primary factors that affect transport of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) within source zones. Soil-to-groundwater ratios (\u03b3Soil-GW) were calculated for each site and PFAS as an empirical transport metric and regressed against select soil chemical and physical properties, as well as relevant interactions thereof, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Total organic carbon and percent total clay content were significant covariates and best fit log-transformed \u03b3Soil-GW with a parallel lines model. Regression parameters were used to derive apparent KOC estimates for 15 perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, and the 6:2 and 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonates, which were bimodal where significant differences were primarily observed between PFAS with fewer than 8 perfluorinated carbons (including perfluorooctoanoic acid; PFOA) and those with 8 or more (including perfluorooctane sulfonate; PFOS). Surprisingly, clay content was observed with a negative slope (i.e., \u03b3Soil-GW decreased with increasing clay content), which may reflect greater retardation at more permeable sites due to air-water interfacial partitioning. Further analysis demonstrated that \u03b3Soil-GW is also affected by the degree of flushing in a way that suggests mass transfer (as opposed to hysteretic desorption) primarily controls mass discharge at poorly flushed sites. Overall, this meta-analysis demonstrates that PFAS retention in soil is significant, but depends on a combination of fundamental partitioning mechanisms that may not be predictable in all cases based on transport models that assume an equilibrium condition.", "Source area management practices as remediation tool to address groundwater nitrate pollution in drinking supply wells ": "Nitrate in drinking water may cause serious health problems for consumers. Agricultural activities are known to be the main source of groundwater nitrate contaminating rural domestic and urban public water supply wells in farming regions. Management practices have been proposed to reduce the amount of nitrate in groundwater, including improved nutrient management practices and \u201cpump and fertilize\u201d with nitrate-affected irrigation wells. Here, we evaluate the feasibility and long-term impacts of agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) in the source area of public water supply wells. A numerical model of nitrate fate and transport was developed for the Modesto basin, part of California's Central Valley aquifer system. The basin is representative of semi-arid agricultural regions around the world with a diversity of crop types, overlying an unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system. A local public supply well in an economically disadvantaged community surrounded by farmland was the focus of this study. Model scenarios implemented include business as usual, alternative low-impact crops, and Ag-MAR in the source area of the public supply well. Alternative nutrient management and recharge practices act as remediation tools in the area between farmland and the public supply well. Improved agricultural source area management practices are shown to be an effective tool to maintain or even enhance groundwater quality in the targeted supply well while remediating ambient groundwater.\n                  Best results are obtained when lowering nitrate load while also increasing recharge in the source area simultaneously. This scenario reduced nitrate in the supply well's drinking water by 80% relative to the business as usual scenario. It also remediated ambient groundwater used by domestic wells between the source area farmlands and the supply well and showed 60% more reduction of nitrate after 60\u202fyears of application. Increasing recharge led to shorter initial response time (five years) and showed the most sustainable impact. Our analysis further suggests that Ag-MAR in a highly discontinuous, wide-spread pattern leads to slow water quality response and may not yield sufficient water quality improvements.", "Groundwater flow velocities in a fractured carbonate aquifer-type: Implications for contaminant transport ": "Contaminants that are highly soluble in groundwater are rapidly transported via fractures in mechanically resistant sedimentary rock aquifers. Hence, a rigorous methodology is needed to estimate groundwater flow velocities in such fractured aquifers. Here, we propose an approach using borehole hydraulic testing to compute flow velocities in an un-faulted area of a fractured carbonate aquifer by applying the cubic law to a parallel plate model. The Cadeby Formation (Yorkshire, NE England) \u2013 a Permian dolostone aquifer present beneath the University of Leeds Farm - is the fractured aquifer selected for this hydraulic experiment.\n                  The bedding plane fractures of this dolostone aquifer, which are sub-horizontal, sub-parallel and laterally persistent, largely dominate the flow at shallow (<~40 mBGL) depths. These flowing bedding plane discontinuities are separated by a rock matrix which is relatively impermeable (K\n                     \n                        well-test\n                     /K\n                     \n                        core-plug\n                     ~104) as is common in fractured carbonate aquifers.\n                  In the workflow reported here, the number of flowing fractures - mainly bedding plane fractures - intersecting three open monitoring wells are found from temperature/fluid conductivity and acoustic/optical televiewer logging. Following well installation, average fracture hydraulic apertures for screened intervals are found from analysis of slug tests. For the case study aquifer, this workflow predicts hydraulic apertures ranging from 0.10 up to 0.54\u202fmm. However, groundwater flow velocities range within two order of magnitude from 13 up to 242\u202fm/day.\n                  Notably, fracture apertures and flow velocities rapidly reduce with increasing depth below the water table; the upper ~10\u202fm shows relatively high values of hydraulic conductivity (0.30\u20132.85\u202fm/day) and corresponding flow velocity (33\u2013242\u202fm/day). Permeability development around the water table in carbonate aquifer-types is common, and arises where high pCO2 recharge water from the soil zone causes calcite/dolomite dissolution. Hence, agricultural contaminants entering the aquifer with recharge water are laterally transported rapidly within this upper part.\n                  Computation of groundwater flow velocities allows determination of the Reynolds number. Values of up ~1, indicating the lower limit of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, are found at the studied site, which is situated away from major fault traces. Hence, turbulent flow is likely to arise in proximity to tectonic structures, such as normal faults, which localize flow and enhance karstification. The occurrence of turbulent flow in correspondence of such tectonic structures should be represented in regional groundwater flow simulations.", "Methods for characterizing the fate and effects of nano zerovalent iron during groundwater remediation ": "The emplacement of nano zerovalent iron (nZVI) for groundwater remediation is usually monitored by common measurements such as pH, total iron content, and oxidation\u2013reduction potential (ORP) by potentiometry. However, the interpretation of such measurements can be misleading because of the complex interactions between the target materials (e.g., suspensions of highly reactive and variably aggregated nanoparticles) and aquifer materials (sediments and groundwater), and multiple complications related to sampling and detection methods. This paper reviews current practice for both direct and indirect characterizations of nZVI during groundwater remediation and explores prospects for improving these methods and/or refining the interpretation of these measurements. To support our recommendations, results are presented based on laboratory batch and column studies of nZVI detection using chemical, electrochemical, and geophysical methods. Chemical redox probes appear to be a promising new method for specifically detecting nZVI, based on laboratory tests. The potentiometric and voltammetric detections of iron nanoparticles, using traditional stationary disc electrodes, rotating disc electrodes, and flow-through cell disc electrodes, provide insight for interpreting ORP measurements, which are affected by solution chemistry conditions and the interactions between iron nanoparticles and the electrode surface. The geophysical methods used for characterizing ZVI during groundwater remediation are reviewed and its application for nZVI detection is assessed with results of laboratory column experiments.", "Do CSIA data from aquifers inform on natural degradation of chlorinated ethenes in aquitards? ": "Back-diffusion of chlorinated ethenes (CEs) from low-permeability layers (LPLs) causes contaminant persistence long after the primary spill zones have disappeared. Naturally occurring degradation in LPLs lowers remediation time frames, but its assessment through sediment sampling is prohibitive in conventional remediation projects. Scenario simulations were performed with a reactive transport model (PHT3D in FloPy) accounting for isotope effects associated with degradation, sorption, and diffusion, to evaluate the potential of CSIA data from aquifers in assessing degradation in aquitards. The model simulated a trichloroethylene (TCE) DNAPL and its pollution plume within an aquifer-aquitard-aquifer system. Sequential reductive dechlorination to ethene and sorption were uniform in the aquitard and did not occur in the aquifer. After 10\u202fyears of loading the aquitard through diffusion from the plume, subsequent source removal triggered release of TCE by back-diffusion. In the upper aquifer, during the loading phase, \u03b413C-TCE was slightly enriched (up to 2\u2030) due to diffusion effects stimulated by degradation in the aquitard. In the upper aquifer, during the release phase, (i) source removal triggered a huge \u03b413C increase especially for higher CEs, (ii) moreover, downstream decreasing isotope ratios (caused by downgradient later onset of the release phase) with temporal increasing isotope ratios reflect aquitard degradation (as opposed to downstream increasing and temporally constant isotope ratios in reactive aquifers), and (iii) the carbon isotope mass balance (CIMB) enriched up to 4\u2030 as lower CEs (more depleted, less sorbing) have been transported deeper into the aquitard. Thus, enriched CIMB does not indicate oxidative transformation in this system. The CIMB enrichment enhanced with more sorption and lower aquitard thickness. Thin aquitards are quicker flushed from lower CEs leading to faster CIMB enrichment over time. CIMB enrichment is smaller or nearly absent when daughter products accumulate. Aquifer CSIA patterns indicative of aquitard degradation were similar in case of linear decreasing rate constants but contrasted with previous simulations assuming a thin bioactive zone. The Rayleigh equation systematically underestimates the extent of TCE degradation in aquifer samples especially during the loading phase and for conditions leading to long remediation time frames (low groundwater flow velocity, thicker aquitards, strong sorption in the aquitard). The Rayleigh equation provides a good and useful picture on aquitard degradation during the release phase throughout the sensitivity analysis. This modelling study provides a framework on how aquifer CSIA data can inform on the occurrence of aquitard degradation and its pitfalls.", "The effect of freezing and thawing on water flow and MCPA leaching in partially frozen soil ": "Limited knowledge and experimental data exist on pesticide leaching through partially frozen soil. The objective of this study was to better understand the complex processes of freezing and thawing and the effects these processes have on water flow and pesticide transport through soil. To achieve this we conducted a soil column irrigation experiment to quantify the transport of a non-reactive tracer and the herbicide MCPA in partially frozen soil. In total 40 intact topsoil and subsoil columns from two agricultural fields with contrasting soil types (silt and loam) in South-East Norway were used in this experiment. MCPA and bromide were applied on top of all columns. Half the columns were then frozen at \u22123\u202f\u00b0C while the other half of the columns were stored at +4\u202f\u00b0C. Columns were then subjected to repeated irrigation events at a rate of 5\u202fmm artificial rainwater for 5\u202fh at each event. Each irrigation was followed by 14-day periods of freezing or refrigeration. Percolate was collected and analysed for MCPA and bromide. The results show that nearly 100% more MCPA leached from frozen than unfrozen topsoil columns of Hov silt and Kroer loam soils. Leaching patterns of bromide and MCPA were very similar in frozen columns with high concentrations and clear peaks early in the irrigation process, and with lower concentrations leaching at later stages. Hardly any MCPA leached from unfrozen topsoil columns (0.4\u20130.5% of applied amount) and concentrations were very low. Bromide showed a different flow pattern indicating a more uniform advective-dispersive transport process in the unfrozen columns with higher concentrations leaching but without clear concentration peaks. This study documents that pesticides can be preferentially transported through soil macropores at relatively high concentrations in partially frozen soil. These findings indicate, that monitoring programs should include sampling during snow melt or early spring in areas were soil frost is common as this period could imply exposure peaks in groundwater or surface water.", "The long term effect of agricultural, vadose zone and climatic factors on nitrate contamination in Nebraska's groundwater system ": "A four-decade dataset (1974\u20132013) of 107,823 nitrate samples in 25,993 wells from western and eastern parts of Nebraska was used to assess long-term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration and decadal changes in the extent of groundwater nitrate-contaminated areas (NO3-N\u202f\u2265\u202f10\u202fmg\u202fN/L) over the entire state. Spatial statistics and regressions were used to investigate the relationships between groundwater nitrate concentrations and several potential natural and anthropogenic factors, including soil drainage capacities, vadose zone characteristics, crop production areas, and irrigation systems. The results of this study show that there is no statistically significant trend in groundwater nitrate concentrations in western Nebraska, in contrast with the increasing trend (p\u202f<\u202f.05) to the east. The spatial extent and nitrate concentrations in contaminated groundwater in center pivot-irrigated areas was less than in gravity-irrigated areas. Areas with a thicker vadose zone and larger saturated thickness of the aquifer have relatively lower nitrate concentrations. The results of a classification and regression tree (CART) model indicate the difference in the influence of physical factors on groundwater nitrate concentrations between western and eastern Nebraska, namely that groundwater nitrate concentrations correspond with vadose zone thickness, effective hydraulic conductivity, and saturated thickness in the west, while in eastern Nebraska, concentrations are correlated with average percent sand in the topsoil (0\u2013150\u202fcm), well depth, and effective hydraulic conductivity.", "A simple contaminant fate and transport modelling tool for management and risk assessment of groundwater pollution from contaminated sites ": "Contaminated sites pose a significant threat to groundwater resources. The resources that can be allocated by water regulators for site investigation and cleanup are limited compared to the large number of contaminated sites. Numerical transport models of individual sites require large amounts of data and are labor intensive to set up, and thus they are likely to be too expensive to be useful in the management of thousands of contaminated sites. Therefore, simple tools based on analytical solutions of contaminant transport models are widely used to assess (at an early stage) whether a site might pose a threat to groundwater. We present a tool consisting of five different models, representing common geological settings, contaminant pathways, and transport processes. The tool employs a simplified approach for preliminary, conservative, fast and inexpensive estimation of the contamination levels of aquifers. This is useful for risk assessment applications or to select and prioritize the sites, which should be targeted for further investigation. The tool is based on steady-state semi-analytical models simulating different contaminant transport scenarios from the source to downstream groundwater, and includes both unsaturated and saturated transport processes. The models combine existing analytical solutions from the literature for vertical (from the source to the top of the aquifer) and horizontal (within the aquifer) transport. The effect of net recharge causing a downward migration and an increase of vertical dispersion and dilution of the plume is also considered. Finally, we illustrate the application of the tool for a preliminary assessment of two contaminated sites in Denmark and compare the model results with field data. The comparison shows that a first preliminary assessment with conservative, and often non-site specific parameter selection, is qualitatively consistent with broad trends in observations and provides a conservative estimate of contamination.", "Prediction of annual drinking water quality reduction based on Groundwater Resource Index using the artificial neural network and fuzzy clustering ": "Drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting different aspects of human life and the environment. Due to water scarcity, prediction of water quality reduction is very crucial for urban and rural communities. This study contributes by applying artificial neural network and modified fuzzy clustering techniques to estimate the drops in potential drinking water quality in the GIS environment. In this research, the probability of occurrence of adverse annual changes in the water quality of drinking water is estimated. The model was tested using real instances of the southeast aquifers, the regions of the central parts of the IRAN and especially the significant portions of the aquifers of the east area. To validate the model, the data adequacy test and the standardization of the drought index are used. The results of the lowest available water quality and the highest drought using ANNs show that the qualitative stress conditions in large part of the country's aquifers are in unfavorable conditions. Evidence from this research shows that the aquifers in these areas are expected to have severe drought stress and poor quality class status. Also, the computational results indicate that the modified clustering method increases the efficiency of the prediction model as against the previous research. The outcomes do not show a relatively favorable state of drinking water quality for some aquifers in the country. However, the conditions for quantitative changes in the depth of water, based on the predicted results of ANN, are considered critical. The generated maps demonstrate that about 64% of the study area is subjected to a severe deterioration in the quality of drinking water if the current trend continues in the exploitation of aquifers. As a result, the main finding the present study is that the probability of groundwater quality decline is significant in many aquifers in the country.", "A practical tool for estimating subsurface LNAPL distributions and transmissivity using current and historical fluid levels in groundwater wells: Effects of entrapped and residual LNAPL ": "A model is presented to account for elevation-dependent residual and entrapped LNAPL above and below, respectively, the water-saturated zone when predicting subsurface LNAPL specific volume (fluid volume per unit area) and transmissivity from current and historic fluid levels in wells. Physically-based free, residual, and entrapped LNAPL saturation distributions and LNAPL relative permeabilities are integrated over a vertical slice of the subsurface to yield the LNAPL specific volumes and transmissivity. The model accounts for effects of fluctuating water tables. Hypothetical predictions are given for different porous media (loamy sand and clay loam), fluid levels in wells, and historic water-table fluctuations. It is shown the elevation range from the LNAPL-water interface in a well to the upper elevation where the free LNAPL saturation approaches zero is the same for a given LNAPL thickness in a well regardless of porous media type. Further, the LNAPL transmissivity is largely dependent on current fluid levels in wells and not historic levels. Results from the model can aid developing successful LNAPL remediation strategies and improving the design and operation of remedial activities. Results of the model also can aid in accessing the LNAPL recovery technology endpoint, based on the predicted transmissivity.", "Acid mine drainage sources and hydrogeochemistry at the Yatani mine, Yamagata, Japan: A geochemical and isotopic study ": "This paper describes the geochemistry of groundwater and its flow system in the closed Yatani mine in southern Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. The mine is located in a sulfide deposit containing pyrite and has been generating acid mine drainage (AMD). The study was intended to elucidate the formation of AMD and its flow patterns using geological, hydrological, geochemical, and isotopic techniques. The results indicate that AMD is formed by the interaction of groundwater with sulfide minerals, sand slime, and tailings back-filled into excavated mine areas. Groundwater recharge areas were identified on the mountain slope at an elevation of ~900\u202fm. The formation of AMD in the drifts and shaft was more extensive than that in the deeper drainage levels. Principal component analysis was applied to the hydrogeochemical data to identify the causes of AMD formation. The first, second, and third principal components reveal that the increased ion concentrations in mine drainage are a result of water\u2013mineral reactions in excavated mine areas, the contribution of groundwater in deep reductive environments, and isotopic fractionation during precipitation, respectively. A promising method of reducing AMD formation is to prevent contact between dissolved oxygen and sulfide minerals by increasing the drainage level or by filling the shallow underground excavated area with cementitious materials.", "Storm water runoff concentration matrix for urban areas ": "The infrastructure (roads, sidewalk, commercial and residential structures) added during the land development and urbanisation process is designed to collect precipitation and convey it out of the watershed, typically in existing surface water channels, such as streams and rivers. The quality of surface water, seepage water and ground water is influenced by pollutants that collect on impervious surfaces and that are carried by urban storm water runoff. Heavy metals, e.g. lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), mineral oil hydrocarbons (MOH) and readily soluble salts in runoff, contribute to the degradation of water. An intensive literature search on the distribution and concentration of the surface-dependent runoff water has been compiled. Concentration variations of several pollutants derived from different surfaces have been averaged. More than 300 references providing about 1300 data for different pollutants culminate in a representative concentration matrix consisting of medians and extreme values. This matrix can be applied to long-term valuations and numerical modelling of storm water treatment facilities.", "Transport and retention of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in natural soils: Importance of soil organic matter and mineral contents, and solution ionic strength ": "Effects of soil organic matter and mineral contents, and solution ionic strength on the transport of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in different types of soils (i.e., desert soil, black soil, and red soil) were systematically investigated with a set of laboratory column experiments. The retention of PFOA in the soils under two solution ionic strengths conditions (1.0\u202fmM and 10.0\u202fmM CaCl2) followed an order of red soil > black soil > desert soil (expect red soil in 10\u202fmM CaCl2). PFOA retention in the black soil (soil organic carbon content: 2.57%) was higher than that in the desert soil (soil organic carbon content: 0.05%). In addition, PFOA also showed higher mobility in treated black soils with lower organic carbon contents. These results suggest that the hydrophobic interaction is a key mechanism governing PFOA retention and transport in soils. Besides, more PFOA retention in the red soil (zeta potential: 7.25\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fmV and 14.80\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.20\u202fmV) than the desert soil (\u221215.70\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fmV and\u202f\u2212\u202f9.11\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fmV) was observed, suggesting that electrostatic interaction may be another important mechanism for PFOA retention and transport in soils. Increasing ionic strength slightly increased the retention of PFOA in negatively charged desert and black soils, but significantly decreased the retention of PFOA in the positively charged red soil. Findings of this study point to the importance of soil physiochemical properties to the fate and transport of PFOA in natural soils.", "Pore scale investigation on scaling-up micro-macro capillary number and wettability on trapping and mobilization of residual fluid ": "The mobilization mechanism of the trapped phases controlled by the viscous force and capillary force in porous media is crucial to various engineering applications. In this paper, pore scale water flooding process in rock models with nonuniform wettability is simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using the volume of fluid (VOF) model. Four types of rock are imaged by micro-CT (\u03bc-CT) and adopted as inputs to generate the structured mesh models. The simulations of two-phase flow are carried out to study the immiscible displacement process in the development of oil fields. The scaling-up critical capillary number at micro-macro scale are acquired and validated, the effects of which on relative permeability, residual oil recovery and immiscible displacement efficiency are analyzed. The simulation results indicate that the critical capillary number at microscopic scale ranges from 10\u22126 to 10\u22125 for water-wetted and oil-wetted rock respectively, and approaches to 1 at the macro scale. The effect of wettability on oil recovery is positive for intermediate-wetted or weak water-wetted rock, while negative for strong wettability.", "Optimizing the experimental design of soil columns in saturated and unsaturated transport experiments ": "Soil column experiments in both the saturated and unsaturated regimes are widely used for applied and theoretical studies in such diverse fields as transport model evaluation, fate and transport of pesticides, explosives, microbes, heavy metals and non aqueous phase liquids, and for evapotranspiration studies. The apparent simplicity of constructing soil columns conceals a number of technical issues which can seriously affect the outcome of an experiment, such as the presence or absence of macropores, artificial preferential flow paths, non-ideal infiltrate injection and unrealistic moisture regimes. This review examines the literature to provide an analysis of the state of the art for constructing both saturated and unsaturated soil columns. Common design challenges are discussed and best practices for potential solutions are presented. This article discusses both basic principles and the practical advantages and disadvantages of various experimental approaches. Both repacked and monolith-type columns are discussed. The information in this review will assist soil scientists, hydrogeologists and environmental professionals in optimizing the construction and operation of soil column experiments in order to achieve their objectives, while avoiding serious design flaws which can compromise the integrity of their results.", "Prediction of acid rock drainage in waste rock piles Part 1: Water film model for geochemical reactions and application to a full-scale case study ": "Geochemical reactions taking place at the rock surface and pore water interface, and rapid preferential water flow through waste rock piles are identified as two primary steps for acid rock drainage (ARD) and metal leaching (ML) processes. This paper (Part I) develops a water film model to describe the interactions among sulphide minerals, pore water and oxygen, which considers the reactive surface areas as the primary sites to capture geochemical reactions including sulphide oxidation and neutralization reactions, and also considers acid and metal ion storage in pore water. In addition, the proposed water film model is further coupled with a pile-scale mass transport model to investigate a specific case of the main waste rock pile at the Equity Silver mine, Canada. Overall, the simulated profile of oxygen concentration matches the historical monitoring data. The modeling results revealed potential controlling mechanisms for ARD generation inside the waste rock pile and provided insights into the impact of an engineered cover on the waste rock pile.", "Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI): Aspects of the core-shell structure and reactions with inorganic species in water ": "Aspects of the core-shell model of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) and their environmental implications were examined in this work. The structure and elemental distribution of nZVI were characterized by X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) with nanometer-scale spatial resolution in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The analysis provides unequivocal evidence of a layered structure of nZVI consisting of a metallic iron core encapsulated by a thin amorphous oxide shell. Three aqueous environmental contaminants, namely Hg(II), Zn(II) and hydrogen sulfide, were studied to probe the reactive properties and the surface chemistry of nZVI. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) analysis of the reacted particles indicated that Hg(II) was sequestrated via chemical reduction to elemental mercury. On the other hand, Zn(II) removal was achieved via sorption to the iron oxide shell followed by zinc hydroxide precipitation. Hydrogen sulfide was immobilized on the nZVI surface as disulfide (S2\n                     2\u2212) and monosulfide (S2\u2212) species. Their relative abundance in the final products suggests that the retention of hydrogen sulfide occurs via reactions with the oxide shell to form iron sulfide (FeS) and subsequent conversion to iron disulfide (FeS2). The results presented herein highlight the multiple reactive pathways permissible with nZVI owing to its two functional constituents. The core-shell structure imparts nZVI with manifold functional properties previously unexamined and grants the material with potentially new applications.", "Applicability of the dual isotopes \u03b415N and \u03b418O to identify nitrate in groundwater beneath irrigated cropland ": "Identification of the nitrate sources that adversely impact groundwater quality is a necessary first step in the control of this major worldwide pollutant. The impact of nitrate leachate from urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) (50% urea-N, 25% ammonium-N, 25% nitrate-N) fertilizer, whose use has increased dramatically in the last three decades largely because it can be applied through sprinkler irrigation systems to corn in all growth stages, is investigated. The dual isotopes \u03b415NNO3 and \u03b418ONO3 were measured in groundwater samples from 39 irrigation wells in two intensively sprinkler-irrigated, corn-growing areas of Nebraska with nitrate-contaminated (N\u202f>\u202f10\u202fmg/L) groundwater and documented UAN use to ascertain whether nitrified ammonia and nitrate fertilizers can be distinguished in the High Plains aquifer. The areas, which are highly vulnerable to nitrate leaching and differ only in the composition and thickness of their unsaturated zones, are uniquely suited to provide scientific evidence of the feasibility of identifying nitrate fertilizer leachate in groundwater and thereby add significantly to the small body of existing and inconclusive data. The dual isotope method (DIM) results indicate that the nitrate contamination in 38 wells is mostly nitrified ammonium fertilizer. Most importantly, nitrate fertilizer from UAN was not identified isotopically in groundwater beneath almost all fields with documented heavy UAN use. This could be a potentially valuable finding for fertilizer management or it could convey limitations on the appropriateness of the DIM for nitrate fertilizer source identification in groundwater. Slightly enriched \u03b415NNO3 values in a few wells coincide with the practice of wintering cattle on corn stubble, which reportedly occurred more frequently in one focus area. The absence of natural soil-N leachates and denitrification in groundwater enabled an apparently reliable identification of manure leachates in both areas.", "Methane gas transport in unconfined aquifers: A numerical sensitivity study of a controlled release experiment at CFB Borden ": "Subsurface leakage of natural gas from petroleum wells can impact freshwater aquifers. Accurate prediction of gas migration in the subsurface will depend on knowledge of permeability, porosity, and flow system conditions. A series of two-dimensional numerical multi-phase flow simulations (CFbio) were conducted to investigate the role of multi-phase parameters (relative permeability and air entry pressure), flow system conditions (intrinsic permeability, anisotropy, and groundwater velocity), and geometric properties (layer thickness and layer lateral continuity) on the flow of gas-phase methane emanating from two variable-rate point sources in an unconfined sandy aquifer. Numerical simulations showed that for a homogeneous, weakly anisotropic aquifer, gas migrates almost exclusively vertically due to buoyancy, before venting to the vadose zone and atmosphere. As vertical migration became restricted through increased anisotropy, inclusion of lower-permeable layers, or increased horizontal groundwater velocity, an increase in the lateral component of gas migration was observed. This led to the formation of a broader lateral migration of the gas-phase plume and establishment of variably distributed vertical preferential flow paths, ultimately resulting in increased gas retention in the aquifer with relatively less methane reaching the vadose zone or atmosphere. The inclusion of a thin layer with moderately lower permeability (1\u20132 orders of magnitude) and increased air entry pressure was used to depict a fine-grained sand lens within a uniform aquifer. This subtle feature led to the formation of thin gas pools extending up- and down-gradient beneath the lens, allowing methane to travel much farther and faster than by groundwater advection alone, which is consistent with field observations during the experiment. In all scenarios investigated gas-phase methane was shown to migrate predominantly vertically due to buoyancy, until the aquitard permeability was <30% of the aquifer permeability. Our modelling demonstrates that even subtle permeability contrasts, together with capillary pressure changes demarcating grain-scale bedding, will lead to extensive lateral free-phase gas migration, and development of a more extensive and complex zone of impacted aquifer than presupposed.", "Influence of vertical flows in wells on groundwater sampling ": "Pumped groundwater sampling evaluations often assume that horizontal head gradients predominate and the sample comprises an average of water quality variation over the well screen interval weighted towards contributing zones of higher hydraulic conductivity (a permeability-weighted sample). However, the pumping rate used during sampling may not always be sufficient to overcome vertical flows in wells driven by ambient vertical head gradients. Such flows are reported in wells with screens between 3 and 10m in length where lower pumping rates are more likely to be used during sampling. Here, numerical flow and particle transport modeling is used to provide insight into the origin of samples under ambient vertical head gradients and under a range of pumping rates. When vertical gradients are present, sample provenance is sensitive to pump intake position, pumping rate and pumping duration. The sample may not be drawn from the whole screen interval even with extended pumping times. Sample bias is present even when the ambient vertical flow in the wellbore is less than the pumping rate. Knowledge of the maximum ambient vertical flow in the well does, however, allow estimation of the pumping rate that will yield a permeability-weighted sample. This rate may be much greater than that recommended for low-flow sampling. In practice at monitored sites, the sampling bias introduced by ambient vertical flows in wells may often be unrecognized or underestimated when drawing conclusions from sampling results. It follows that care should be taken in the interpretation of sampling data if supporting flow investigations have not been undertaken.", "In situ mobility of uranium in the presence of nitrate following sulfate-reducing conditions ": "Reoxidation and mobilization of previously reduced and immobilized uranium by dissolved-phase oxidants poses a significant challenge for remediating uranium-contaminated groundwater. Preferential oxidation of reduced sulfur-bearing species, as opposed to reduced uranium-bearing species, has been demonstrated to limit the mobility of uranium at the laboratory scale yet field-scale investigations are lacking. In this study, the mobility of uranium in the presence of nitrate oxidant was investigated in a shallow groundwater system after establishing conditions conducive to uranium reduction and the formation of reduced sulfur-bearing species. A series of three injections of groundwater (200 L) containing U(VI) (5 \u03bcM) and amended with ethanol (40 mM) and sulfate (20 mM) were conducted in ten test wells in order to stimulate microbial-mediated reduction of uranium and the formation of reduced sulfur-bearing species. Simultaneous push\u2010pull tests were then conducted in triplicate well clusters to investigate the mobility of U(VI) under three conditions: 1) high nitrate (120 mM), 2) high nitrate (120 mM) with ethanol (30 mM), and 3) low nitrate (2 mM) with ethanol (30 mM). Dilution-adjusted breakthrough curves of ethanol, nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, and U(VI) suggested that nitrate reduction was predominantly coupled to the oxidation of reduced-sulfur bearing species, as opposed to the reoxidation of U(IV), under all three conditions for the duration of the 36-day tests. The amount of sulfate, but not U(VI), recovered during the push\u2010pull tests was substantially more than injected, relative to bromide tracer, under all three conditions and further suggested that reduced sulfur-bearing species were preferentially oxidized under nitrate-reducing conditions. However, some reoxidation of U(IV) was observed under nitrate-reducing conditions and in the absence of detectable nitrate and/or nitrite. This suggested that reduced sulfur-bearing species may not be fully effective at limiting the mobility of uranium in the presence of dissolved and/or solid-phase oxidants. The results of this field study confirmed those of previous laboratory studies which suggested that reoxidation of uranium under nitrate-reducing conditions can be substantially limited by preferential oxidation of reduced sulfur-bearing species.", "Experiments and sensitivity coefficients analysis for multiphase flow model calibration of enhanced DNAPL dissolution ": "Multiphase flow modeling is often used for the comparison and optimization of subsurface nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) remediation schemes. The calibration of such models is a challenging task due to the lack of detailed data describing the initial NAPL spatial distribution and the processes governing the fate and transport of NAPLs in porous media. In this study laboratory scale experiments were conducted to evaluate reagent-enhanced dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) solubilization in saturated heterogeneous media. The DNAPL consisted of both pooled and residual saturation forms. To gain insight into the influence of various input parameters on effluent concentrations, the multiphase flow program was used to compute the sensitivity coefficients of key parameters, relating to the flow, flushing solution properties, soil parameters, NAPL distribution and mass transfer coefficient. The sensitivity coefficients were, in turn, used to aid in the model calibration and to underline the difficulties associated with the calibration of multiphase flow models, most notably the non-uniqueness of the calibration process when complete information is lacking. To alleviate this uncertainty and provide additional constraints, the conducted flushing experiments were jointly used to calibrate the multiphase flow model. The results of the model calibration suggest that the interphase mass transfer coefficient is dependent on the properties of the reagent aqueous solution used for DNAPL remediation, most notably the viscosity and interfacial tension.", "Treatment of inorganic contaminants using permeable reactive barriers\n                  1\n               \n               \n                  1\n                  \n                     Disclaimer: The U.

This technique has progressed rapidly over the past decade from laboratory bench-scale studies to full-scale implementation. Laboratory studies indicate the potential for treatment of a large number of inorganic contaminants, including As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Tc, U, V, NO3, PO4 and SO4. Small-scale field studies have demonstrated treatment of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, NO3, PO4 and SO4. Permeable reactive barriers composed of zero-valent iron have been used in full-scale installations for the treatment of Cr, U, and Tc. Solid-phase organic carbon in the form of municipal compost has been used to remove dissolved constituents associated with acid-mine drainage, including SO4, Fe, Ni, Co and Zn. Dissolved nutrients, including NO3 and PO4, have been removed from domestic septic-system effluent and agricultural drainage.", "Mechanisms of catalyst deactivation ": "The literature treating mechanisms of catalyst deactivation is reviewed. Intrinsic mechanisms of catalyst deactivation are many; nevertheless, they can be classified into six distinct types: (i) poisoning, (ii) fouling, (iii) thermal degradation, (iv) vapor compound formation accompanied by transport, (v) vapor-solid and/or solid-solid reactions, and (vi) attrition/crushing. As (i), (iv), and (v) are chemical in nature and (ii) and (v) are mechanical, the causes of deactivation are basically three-fold: chemical, mechanical and thermal. Each of these six mechanisms is defined and its features are illustrated by data and examples from the literature. The status of knowledge and needs for further work are also summarized for each type of deactivation mechanism. The development during the past two decades of more sophisticated surface spectroscopies and powerful computer technologies provides opportunities for obtaining substantially better understanding of deactivation mechanisms and building this understanding into comprehensive mathematical models that will enable more effective design and optimization of processes involving deactivating catalysts.", "A review of catalytic upgrading of bio-oil to engine fuels ": "As the oil reserves are depleting the need of an alternative fuel source is becoming increasingly apparent. One prospective method for producing fuels in the future is conversion of biomass into bio-oil and then upgrading the bio-oil over a catalyst, this method is the focus of this review article. Bio-oil production can be facilitated through flash pyrolysis, which has been identified as one of the most feasible routes. The bio-oil has a high oxygen content and therefore low stability over time and a low heating value. Upgrading is desirable to remove the oxygen and in this way make it resemble crude oil. Two general routes for bio-oil upgrading have been considered: hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and zeolite cracking. HDO is a high pressure operation where hydrogen is used to exclude oxygen from the bio-oil, giving a high grade oil product equivalent to crude oil. Catalysts for the reaction are traditional hydrodesulphurization (HDS) catalysts, such as Co\u2013MoS2/Al2O3, or metal catalysts, as for example Pd/C. However, catalyst lifetimes of much more than 200h have not been achieved with any current catalyst due to carbon deposition. Zeolite cracking is an alternative path, where zeolites, e.g. HZSM-5, are used as catalysts for the deoxygenation reaction. In these systems hydrogen is not a requirement, so operation is performed at atmospheric pressure. However, extensive carbon deposition results in very short catalyst lifetimes. Furthermore a general restriction in the hydrogen content of the bio-oil results in a low H/C ratio of the oil product as no additional hydrogen is supplied. Overall, oil from zeolite cracking is of a low grade, with heating values approximately 25% lower than that of crude oil. Of the two mentioned routes, HDO appears to have the best potential, as zeolite cracking cannot produce fuels of acceptable grade for the current infrastructure. HDO is evaluated as being a path to fuels in a grade and at a price equivalent to present fossil fuels, but several tasks still have to be addressed within this process. Catalyst development, understanding of the carbon forming mechanisms, understanding of the kinetics, elucidation of sulphur as a source of deactivation, evaluation of the requirement for high pressure, and sustainable sources for hydrogen are all areas which have to be elucidated before commercialisation of the process.", "A review on BiVO4 photocatalyst: Activity enhancement methods for solar photocatalytic applications ": "Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is a promising visible-light driven semiconductor photocatalyst with various benefits such as low production cost, low toxicity, high photostability, resistance to photo-corrosion and narrow band gap with a good response to visible-light excite. However, the fast recombination of photoinduced charge carriers restricts their photocatalytic activity. In the past decades, many attempts were adopted to enhance the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4. Significant advances in understanding the fundamental issues and the development of an efficient photocatalyst have been made in current years. In this review, we have provided a comprehensive overview of the latest progress on the morphology control and growth mechanism of BiVO4 micro/nano-structures, doping with metal and non-metal elements and semiconductor coupling along with some highlights in the photodegradation of organic pollutants under visible-light illumination. This review may benefit the researchers and engineers in the arena of material chemistry for designing new BiVO4 based photocatalysts with low production cost and high efficiency.", "Ammonia-basified 10 wt% Mo/HZSM-5 material with enhanced dispersion of Mo and performance for catalytic aromatization of methane ": "Mo/HZSM-5 is an excellent catalyst for nonoxidative aromatization of methane, but it tends to deactivate rapidly due to severe coking. To date much effort has been devoted to enhancing activity and stability of Mo-impregnated HZSM-5 zeolite with Mo loading of 6\u2009wt% or lower in methane aromatization. For this aromatization reaction, this work first reports a significant improvement in the catalytic performance of 10\u2009wt% Mo/HZSM-5 material after preparation via impregnating HZSM-5 zeolite with ammonia-basified molybdate aqueous solution and pretreatment with a CH4/Ar/He (9:1:10, v/v) mixture. After 38\u2009h of continuous reaction at 700\u2009\u00b0C and 1500\u2009mL g\u22121\u2009h\u22121 (90\u2009vol% CH4/Ar), this 10\u2009wt% Mo-impregnated catalyst is still able to give an aromatic yield of 7% and a CH4 conversion of 9.1%. This enhanced catalytic performance of this 10\u2009wt% Mo sample is attributed to the ammonia basification of impregnating solution in catalyst preparation, which leads to a larger amount of highly dispersed Mo species in the zeolitic channels and a less amount of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites remained on the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst.", "A review on the catalytic combustion of soot in Diesel particulate filters for automotive applications: From powder catalysts to structured reactors ": "The current soot oxidation catalyst scenario has been reviewed, the main factors that affect the activity of powder catalysts have been highlighted and kinetic soot oxidation models have been examined. A critical review of recent advances in modelling approaches has also been presented in this work. The multiscale nature of DPFs lends itself to a hierarchical organization of models, over various orders of magnitude. Different observation scales (e.g., wall, channel, entire filter) have often been addressed with separate modelling approaches that are rarely connected to one another, mainly because of computational difficulties. Nevertheless, DPFs exhibit an intrinsic multi-scale complexity that is reflected by a trade-off between fine and large-scale phenomena. Consequently, the catalytic behavior of DPFs usually results in a non-linear combination of multi-scale phenomena.", "Ionic liquids and catalysis: Recent progress from knowledge to applications ": "This review gives a survey on the latest most representative developments and progress concerning ionic liquids, from their fundamental properties to their applications in catalytic processes.

There are many materials that are found to show good photocatalytic activity in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) and visible light. However, the applications of these materials are limited to the UV portion of sunlight. \u03b1-Fe2O3 has an advantage over the other conventional materials like TiO2, ZnO, etc. in using solar energy for photocatalytic applications due to its lower band gap \u223c2.2eV value. As a result of which Fe2O3 is capable of absorbing a large portion of the visible solar spectrum (absorbance edge \u223c600nm). Also its good chemical stability in aqueous medium, low cost, abundance and nontoxic nature makes it a promising material for photocatalytic water treatment and water splitting applications. Except these advantages the usage of Fe2O3 has been restricted by many anomalies such as higher e\u2013h recombination effect, low diffusion length and VB positioning (VB is positive with respect to H+/H2 potential). This article reviews the research that has been carried out to overcome these basic limitations and to enhance the photocatalytic activity of \u03b1-Fe2O3.", "Catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons over modified ZSM-5 zeolites to produce light olefins: A review ": "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons has been the major source of light olefins for more than half a century. The recent studies have reported that ethylene and propylene can also be produced through the cracking of hydrocarbons over modified ZSM-5 zeolites in a considerable amount.\n                  This paper highlights the important current ideas about acid-catalyzed hydrocarbon cracking that has resulted in high yield of ethylene and propylene. Light olefin production via catalytic cracking of various industrial feedstocks, ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane, over modified ZSM-5 zeolites, has been reviewed in the present paper. Furthermore, the influence of various employed promoters, i.e., alkali and alkaline earth, transition, rare earth elements, and phosphorus, on the chemical properties of the modified ZSM-5 and the performance of resulting catalyst in enhancing the selectivity to light olefins, have been addressed. Moreover, the influences of different factors, including the zeolite acidity, Si/Al ratio and the temperature, on the light olefin production and the reaction scheme have been specified. The role of incorporated element in the catalytic cracking mechanism is also summarized.", "Structure-dependent catalytic properties of mesoporous cobalt oxides in furfural hydrogenation ": "As the development of noble metal free catalysts became important in the biomass conversion, catalytic hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) is investigated over ordered mesoporous cobalt oxide (m-Co3O4). When m-Co3O4 is reduced at 350 and 500\u202f\u00b0C in hydrogen, the original crystal structure of Co3O4 is changed to CoO and Co, respectively. Here we examine the effect of the structure, porosity, and oxidation state of m-Co3O4 to identify catalytically active species for hydrogenation of FAL. Among cobalt oxide catalysts having different crystal structures and symmetry, m-CoO having p6mm symmetry exhibits the highest activity. In product selectivity, the CoO phase induces FAL hydrogenolysis by selective production of 2-methyl furan (MF), while the Co3O4 and Co phases promote preferential hydrogenation of side chain (carbonyl group) of FAL to furfuryl alcohol. Density functional theory calculations also reveal that the adsorption of FAL on CoO(111) is higher than Co(111). Overall, these studies demonstrate that CoO as the most active phase is responsible for the high FAL conversion and the distinct pathway of FAL to MF.", "Biomass into chemicals: Conversion of sugars to furan derivatives by catalytic processes ": "Recently, the production of furan derivatives from sugars has become exciting in chemistry and in catalysis studies, because it aids one of the major routes for achieving sustainable energy supply and chemicals production. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), 2,5-furan-dicarboxylic acid (2,5-FDCA) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (2,5-DMF) have been called the \u201csleeping giants\u201d of renewable intermediate chemicals. 5-HMF is a dehydration product of hexoses and a potential substitute of petroleum-based building blocks of various polymers. 2,5-FDCA is derived from oxidative dehydration of hexoses and is considered as one of the top 12 compounds made from a sugar into a value-added chemical [T. Werpy, G. Petersen, Top Value Added Chemicals From Biomass, 2004. Available electronically at http://www.osti.gov/bridge]. 2,5-DMF is produced through hydrogenation of HMF and is less volatile and of 40% higher energy density than ethanol. This review discusses mainly the catalytic routes for the synthesis of 5-HMF, 2,5-FDCA, 2,5-DMF and other furanic derivatives from sugars. Meanwhile, the possible reaction mechanism for the conversion of hexoses is discussed, and furthermore, some promising research orientations and advantageous catalysts are suggested based on the major problems encountered in the recent research.", "Short history and present trends of Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis ": "Due to the large volume of existing literature on Fischer\u2013Tropsch (FT) synthesis, the diversity of the subject and the actually reoriented interest, it seemed indicated to write a historical sketch about the process, putting also emphasis on present trends and future options.\n                  The matter is complicated and may be regarded from different positions. Thus history and trends have been divided into several lines which are elaborated individually:\n                        \n                           &#x02022;\n                           The changing environment of demand and supply of fossil energies and the more stringently upcoming aspects of pollution control, of cleanliness of the automotive fuels and of energy saving.\n                        \n                        \n                           &#x02022;\n                           The development of FT-reactors and processes, an area of highest present industrial activity and progress.\n                        \n                        \n                           &#x02022;\n                           Preparation and performance of catalysts with particular concern about cobalt as the base metal.\n                        \n                        \n                           &#x02022;\n                           FT intermediates and elemental reactions, difficult subjects as the FT multistep conversion features on the catalyst surface in the adsorbed state and kinetic principles as selective inhibition and spatial constraints seem to rule the regime.\n                        \n                        \n                           &#x02022;\n                           Kinetic modelling of FT synthesis which has made great progress recently, particularly on the basis of newly provided detailed experimental data.\n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Of course, presenting history and trends of FT synthesis on a few pages means generalising from many individual investigations and developments and also selection of only a few citations. So I want to apologise for all the contributions to science and technology around FT synthesis which I have missed to include into the article.", "Direct conversion of CO2 into methanol over promoted indium oxide-based catalysts ": "Supported indium oxide catalysts are investigated for the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at a total pressure of 40\u202fbar (528\u2013573\u202fK) using a laboratory flow reactor. Surface reducibility, optical spectral characteristics, and catalytic rates and selectivity were correlated to catalyst composition. Promoted catalysts, especially Yttrium or Lanthanum-promoted indium oxide, require higher temperatures (H2-TPR) for surface reduction and display higher CO2 desorption temperatures (CO2-TPD). The promoted samples also have \u02dc20% higher methanol selectivity compared to the non-promoted catalyst, while having similar methanol formation rates (0.330\u20130.420 gMeOH gcat.\n                     \u22121\u202fh\u22121 at 573\u202fK). From 528\u202fK to 558\u202fK, methanol selectivity was over 80%, over all the promoted catalysts, and nearly 100% selectivity was observed at the low temperature range (\u02dc528\u202fK) investigated. The reaction kinetics of Y-promoted catalyst and the results of CO co-feeding experiments suggest that formate pathway is the likely reaction mechanism for methanol formation.", "Effect of Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acidity on glucose conversion to 5-HMF and lactic acid in aqueous and organic media ": "Among the different metal-promoted catalysts for the conversion of C6 sugars to platform chemicals, Sn-based catalysts have demonstrated high activity for different types of reactions, such as isomerization, retro-aldol conversion and dehydration of glucose or its isomers. The form of Sn species, as oxides or ions, along with the properties of the support are important factors determining the prevalent reaction pathway and product distribution. In this framework, we have studied the conversion of glucose mainly in biphasic (H2O/DMSO) media, using four types of Sn-based catalysts, i.e. Sn(II) and Sn(IV) as homogeneous catalysts (Cl- salts) or as the respective oxides in heterogeneous systems, Sn(IV) as SnO2 supported on \u03b3-Al2O3, zeolites (ZSM-5 and Beta) or mesoporous aluminosilicates (Al-MCM-41), and Sn\u03b4+ as ion-exchange cations on the above zeolites. The solid catalysts were characterized by XRD, FT-IR/pyridine, ICP-OES, XRF and N2 porosimetry. Under the studied conditions, the main products obtained were 5-HMF and lactic acid in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Based on the results obtained, it was concluded that the Lewis acidity offered by Sn oxides promotes the retro-aldol reaction pathway towards lactic acid, while the Lewis acidity offered by \u03b3-Al2O3 enhances the synthesis of both 5-HMF and lactic acid. By combining these two functions, the Sn impregnated \u03b3-Al2O3 catalysts induce further increase of both 5-HMF and lactic acid yields. In case of catalysts that possess Br\u00f8nsted acidity as well (i.e. Sn ion-exchanged or impregnated zeolites and Al-MCM-41), dehydration reactions are promoted and the product selectivity is shifted towards 5-HMF synthesis. The highest 5-HMF molar yield of 27.5% (at complete glucose conversion) was achieved by Sn20/\u03b3-Al2O3 accompanied by lactic acid at 16.5% molar yield. For this catalyst the effect of the solvent, catalyst concentration and reaction temperature and time, were further evaluated.", "Hydrogenation of levulinic acid to \u03b3-valerolactone over anatase-supported Ru catalysts: Effect of catalyst synthesis protocols on activity ": "\u03b3-Valerolactone (GVL) is a value-added renewable chemical with great potential and can be obtained from biomass by the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) using metal-based catalysts, such as Ru/TiO2. We here report an in depth study of the effect of catalyst synthesis parameters on the performance of Ru/TiO2 (anatase), varying the nature of the Ru-precursor and the conditions of the calcination and/or reduction step. Catalyst performance was evaluated under batch conditions at a hydrogen pressure of 45bar and using either water (90\u00b0C) or dioxane (150\u00b0C) as solvent. The experiments showed that catalyst activity depends greatly on the Ru precursor used (RuCl3, RuNO(NO3)3, Ru(NH3)6Cl3). Best results when considering the turn-over frequencies (TOF) of the catalysts were obtained using the RuNO(NO3)3 precursor, whereas RuCl3 performed better when considering the initial rate based on Ru intake. An intermediate calcination step and the use of a hydrogen-rich sweep gas during the final reduction step were shown to have a negative impact on catalyst activity. Characterization of the fresh catalysts by BET and TEM provided valuable insight in the relation between the catalyst structure and its activity.", "Catalytic cleavage of the \u03b2-O-4 aryl ether bonds of lignin model compounds by Ru/C catalyst ": "Lignin is a potential renewable feedstock for aromatic compounds. Lignin glues cellulose and hemicellulose together in a rigid structure that protects plants from weather, insects, and disease. This rigidity also poses a barrier to cleavage of lignin into aromatic compounds. Typically, lignin is depolymerized by metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of its \u03b2-O-4 aryl ether (C\u03b2-O) bonds; this process requires high H2 pressure. Here, we show that the abundant aliphatic hydroxyl groups (C\u03b1-OH) in lignin structure, can serve as the hydrogen source in Ru-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of the C\u03b2-O bonds. We pretreated the Ru/C catalyst under reducing and oxidizing conditions to generate various Ru/RuO2 ratios. Then we investigated the effects of Ru and RuO2 on hydrogenolysis of the C\u03b2-O bonds of lignin model compounds. We used X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to determine changes of grain size and Ru content of the Ru/C catalysts, respectively. Our results revealed that Ru/C catalyzed hydrogenolysis of \u03b2-O-4 aryl ether bonds with internal hydrogen (self-hydrogen) as a hydrogen source. The elimination of external H2 in lignin hydrogenolysis is an efficient approach for lignin conversion to valuable aromatic chemicals.", "CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide over MOF catalysts ": "Metal organic framework (MOF) structures of UIO-66, UIO-66-NH2, Mg-MOF-74, MIL-101, CuBTC, ZIF-8, IRMOF-3, and MOF-5 having different acid/base properties were prepared and tested for their catalytic activity in the CO2 cycloaddition to styrene epoxide using a high-pressure batch reactor. The high crystallinity and excellent textural properties of the prepared MOF materials were confirmed by XRD and the N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms at 77K. Their catalytic cycloaddition activities were found to be well correlated with the Lewis acid/base distributions of the materials examined by NH3- and CO2-TPD, respectively, such that the concurrent presence of Lewis acid and base sites were desirable for high catalytic activity. For a given catalyst weight, UIO-66-NH2 showed the best catalytic performance among the MOF samples tested with close to 100% selectivity to carbonate in chlorobenzene under relatively mild reaction conditions (2.0MPa, 373K). UIO-66-NH2 could be reused 3 times without losing catalytic activity in a truly heterogeneous mode without structural deterioration, and it also exhibited excellent cycloaddition activities for different epoxide substrates as well.", "Improving high-temperature NOx conversion in the combined NSR-SCR system with an SCR catalyst mixed with an NH3 adsorbent ": "The growing worldwide interest in environmental protection and the strong demand to decrease the emission of pollutants from automotive exhaust require the development of catalysts and post-cleaning systems that are very efficient and stable. To that end, we investigated ways of improving the high-temperature NH3 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) activity in the NOx storage reduction (NSR) and SCR combined system, and found that NH3 oxidation is promoted under high-temperature NSR-SCR reaction conditions. To suppress NH3 oxidation and improve the NH3-SCR reaction in the NSR-SCR system, we examined mixing an NH3 adsorbent with the SCR catalyst (NSR-SCR\u202f+\u202fNH3 adsorbent system). The H-type mordenite zeolite (H-MOR) adsorbent demonstrated superior performance for retaining NH3 without oxidation under high-temperature transient conditions than the other NH3 adsorbents examined. NOx conversion under high-temperature transient conditions was improved in going from the single NSR system (71% at 450\u202f\u00b0C) to NSR-SCR (75% at 450\u202f\u00b0C), and NSR-SCR+H-MOR (85% at 450\u202f\u00b0C). We confirmed that N2 formed over long times, from the commencement to the end of the lean phase, in the NSR-SCR+H-MOR system. This phenomenon, in which the NH3 adsorbed on H-MOR is gradually released to the SCR up to the end of the lean phase, enhances NOx reduction in the NSR-SCR system.", "Cobalt in N-doped carbon matrix catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes ": "Anilines as important intermediates for both organic synthesis and industrial manufactory are densely substituted with a variety of functional moieties, and the transformation of nitroarenes into corresponding anilines requires catalytically selective hydrogenation catalyst. Herein, we describe a simple pyrolysis strategy to prepare cobalt catalysts in nitrogen-doped carbon matrix applied in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes with molecular hydrogen. The Co/NC catalysts are obtained through thermal treatment of mixed precursors of cobalt phthalocyanine and melamine. The surface-modified Co particles with Co3O4 and CoNx sites are surrounded by N-doped carbon layers according to a series of structural characterization results. These Co/NC catalysts are capable of efficiently selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and various substituted nitroarenes into corresponding anilines under relatively mild reaction conditions. The optimal catalytic hydrogenation performance is contributed to the fast rate of H2 dissociated activation on the CoNx active sites and the facile adsorption of the reactant substances, which is verified by the isotopic H2-D2 exchange experiments, reactant adsorption and the ORR reaction tests. Furthermore, the heterogeneous Co/NC catalyst is highly stable without the Co leaching and deactivation issues during the recycling reaction runs.", "Passive NOx adsorber: An overview of catalyst performance and reaction chemistry ": "Passive NOx adsorbers have been proposed to help address cold start NOx emissions. Although the original concept was proposed earlier, it is not until the last few years that more significant efforts focused on understanding the fundamentals of this technology. Several groups of potential PNAs have been evaluated for low temperature NOx storage and subsequent release, and the laboratory-scale experimental testing results appears to be promising. This review will summarize the currently reported materials for PNA application, their unique behaviors when operating under different conditions, systematically evaluate and compare their performances and discuss the relevant reaction chemistry. The discussion around each specific topic is based on literature reported experimental data from testing and characterizing potential PNA candidates and will put more emphasis on the recent advances in the fundamental understanding of this technology. Since at this stage the mechanism of the adsorption and desorption processes is not fully understood, performance evaluation and reaction chemistry will be discussed independently. Unresolved issues are listed at the end of each section as an attempt to summarize the critical unknowns within a specific research topic.", "Hybrid nanostructures based on titanium dioxide for enhanced photocatalysis ": "The design and development of efficient TiO2-based, hybrid, nanostructured photocatalysts has recently been receiving substantial attention for environmental remediation due to their excellent physiochemical properties. This article provides an overview of the synthesis strategies and characteristics of the next-generation TiO2-based hybrid photocatalysts, produced in combination with polymers (e.g., polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene) and carbon nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, GO, CNT, carbon quantum dots, carbon nitride). The structural aspects, nanostructure formation process, parameters affecting catalytic activity, photocatalytic mechanisms and photocatalytic applications of TiO2-based catalysts for efficient photocatalytic degradation of gaseous/volatile organic pollutants in water/air are reviewed. Further, current research trends, means to increase catalytic performance and future prospects of high-performance TiO2-based hybrid photocatalytic materials, are briefly summarized.", "One-pot co-crystallization of beta and pentasil nanozeolites for the direct conversion of a heavy reformate fraction into xylenes ": "Upgrading of the heavy reformate fraction (HR), containing mainly C9+ aromatics, is usually performed by dealkylation or by transalkylation with added benzene and/or toluene to obtain the more valuable xylenes. However, when the costs related to the use of benzene and toluene are considered, the one-step dealkylation/transalkylation of the C9+ alkylaromatics to xylenes becomes economically attractive. Thus, in a first step, ethylmethylbenzenes (EMB) will have to be dealkylated to toluene, which will then react with the trimethylbenzenes (TMB) present in the HR feed to produce xylenes by transalkylation. Medium pore zeolites will favor dealkylation, whereas large pore zeolites will be more adequate for carrying out the transalkylation reaction. In this work, we present the one-pot synthesis of beta-pentasil aggregates with tunable ratios of the large pore beta to the medium pore component. We show that the close proximity of the beta and pentasil nanocrystals obtained by one-pot co-crystallization synthesis, results in a highly efficient catalyst for the consecutive dealkylation/transalkylation process. The bifunctional catalyst based on the co-crystallized aggregate is more active and selective to xylenes than a catalyst based on a physical mixture of equivalent beta and pentasil nanozeolites synthesized following an analogous procedure. The small crystallite sizes of the co-crystallized zeolites provide the additional advantage of a lower deactivation rate as compared to a reference benchmark catalyst. Results are shown on both, model molecules and industrial HR feed.", "Enhanced CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over TiO2 nanotubes-supported CuO-ZnO-CeO2 catalyst ": "TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) have been extensively applied in many fields owing to their excellent porous structure and surface properties. Herein, a series of CuO-ZnO-CeO2/TNTs catalysts are synthesized through a deposition-precipitation method. The effects of TNTs content and support morphology on the catalyst physicochemical properties and catalytic performance are investigated. The incorporation of TNTs support into CuO-ZnO-CeO2 catalysts not only promotes CuO reducibility and improves the metallic Cu dispersion and specific surface area, but also enhances CO2 adsorption and increases the proportion of basic sites \u03b3, thereby resulting in high CO2 conversion and CH3OH selectivity. It is also shown that CO2 conversion is positively correlated with the Cu specific surface area and that CH3OH selectivity is related to the proportion of basic sites \u03b3. Due to the excellent reducibility, high metallic Cu surface area, superior CO2 adsorption and large proportion of basic sites \u03b3, CuO-ZnO-CeO2/10 wt.% TNTs gives excellent catalytic performance and possesses a great potential as catalyst for methanol synthesis.", "Active Ni/SiO2 catalysts with high Ni content for benzene hydrogenation and CO methanation ": "Ni/SiO2 catalysts with high Ni content were prepared from aqueous Ni(NO3)2 solutions by the precipitation method using Na2SiO3 as a silica precursor and precipitant. This is a simple but efficient method to prepare well-dispersed NiO on silica, which can be further transformed to Ni/SiO2 through an additional reduction process. Various techniques such as nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR), hydrogen chemisorption, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) were employed to characterize the catalysts. The prepared catalysts were applied to two model reactions, benzene hydrogenation and CO methanation. The catalyst showed significantly enhanced performance for these reactions compared to core-shell Ni@SiO2 catalysts and conventional Ni/SiO2 catalysts prepared by wet impregnation.", "Catalyst deactivation: is it predictable? What to do?": "Catalyst deactivation is usually inevitable, although the rate at which it occurs varies greatly. This article discusses the causes of deactivation and the influence on reaction rate. Methods for minimising catalyst deactivation, by tailoring catalyst properties and/or process operations, are presented, as well as reactor configurations suitable for the regeneration of deactivated catalysts. Alkane dehydrogenation is used as an example to demonstrate the variety of engineering solutions possible.", "Manganese oxide-based catalysts for low-temperature selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3: A review ": "Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology has been widely used for the removal of NOx from flue gas. However, it is still a challenge to develop novel low-temperature catalysts for SCR of NOx, especially at temperatures below 200\u00b0C. This paper reviewed the recent progress on the Mn-based catalysts for low-temperature SCR de-NOx with NH3. Catalysts were divided into four categories, single MnOx, Mn-based multi-metal oxide, Mn-based multi-metal oxide with support, and Mn-based monolith catalyst. In the section of single MnOx, the effects of several factors, such as Mn oxidation state, crystallization state, specific surface area and morphology on catalytic activity were systematically reviewed. In the section of multi-metal oxide catalysts, the various roles played by the components of catalysts were intentionally summarized from four aspects, improving de-NOx efficiency, enhancing N2 selectivity, improving resistance to SO2 and H2O, extending operation temperature window, respectively. Moreover, the newly emerging morphology-dependent nanocatalysts were highlighted at the end of this section. In the introduction of supported metal oxide catalysts, the effects of supports were systematically analyzed according to their types, such as Al2O3, TiO2, carbon materials, etc. Considering the actual operation, Mn-based monolith catalysts were also introduced with regard to monolith supports, such as ceramics, metal wire mesh, etc. Subsequently, NH3-SCR mechanisms at low temperature, including E-R and L-H mechanisms, were discussed. At last, the perspective and the future direction of low-temperature SCR of NOx were proposed.", "Water electrolysis based on renewable energy for hydrogen production ": "As an energy storage medium, hydrogen has drawn the attention of research institutions and industry over the past decade, motivated in part by developments in renewable energy, which have led to unused surplus wind and photovoltaic power. Hydrogen production from water electrolysis is a good option to make full use of the surplus renewable energy. Among various technologies for producing hydrogen, water electrolysis using electricity from renewable power sources shows great promise. To investigate the prospects of water electrolysis for hydrogen production, this review compares different water electrolysis processes, i.e., alkaline water electrolysis, proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, solid oxide water electrolysis, and alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolysis. The ion transfer mechanisms, operating characteristics, energy consumption, and industrial products of different water electrolysis apparatus are introduced in this review. Prospects for new water electrolysis technologies are discussed.", "Single-atom catalysis: Bridging the homo- and heterogeneous catalysis ": "Single-atom catalysis, the catalysis by single-atom catalysts (SACs), has attracted considerable attention in recent years as a new frontier in the heterogeneous catalysis field. SACs have the advantages of both homogeneous catalysts (isolated active sites) and heterogeneous catalysts (stable and easy to separate), and are thus predicted to be able to bridge the homo- and heterogeneous catalysis. This prediction was first experimentally demonstrated in 2016. In this mini-review, we summarize the few homogeneous catalysis progresses reported recently where SACs have exhibited promising application: a) Rh/ZnO and Rh/CoO SAC have been used successfully in hydroformylation of olefin of which the activity are comparable to the homogeneous Wilkinson's catalyst; b) a Pt/Al2O3 SAC has shown excellent performance in hydrosilylation reaction; and c) M-N-C SACs (M = Fe, Co etc.) have been applied in the activation of C\u2013H bonds. All of these examples suggest that fabrication of suitable SACs could provide a new avenue for the heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts. These pioneering works shed new light on the recognition of single-atom catalysis in bridging the homo- and heterogeneous catalysis.", "Interfacial engineering of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based metal sulfide heterojunction photocatalysts for energy conversion: A review ": "As one of the most appealing and attractive technologies, photocatalysis is widely used as a promising method to circumvent the environmental and energy problems. Due to its chemical stability and unique physicochemical, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has become research hotspots in the community. However, g-C3N4 photocatalyst still suffers from many problems, resulting in unsatisfactory photocatalytic activity such as low specific surface area, high charge recombination and insufficient visible light utilization. Since 2009, g-C3N4-based heterostructures have attracted the attention of scientists worldwide for their greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance. Overall, this review summarizes the recent advances of g-C3N4-based nanocomposites modified with transition metal sulfide (TMS), including (1) preparation of pristine g-C3N4, (2) modification strategies of g-C3N4, (3) design principles of TMS-modified g-C3N4 heterostructured photocatalysts, and (4) applications in energy conversion. What is more, the characteristics and transfer mechanisms of each classification of the metal sulfide heterojunction system will be critically reviewed, spanning from the following categories: (1) Type I heterojunction, (2) Type II heterojunction, (3) p-n heterojunction, (4) Schottky junction and (5) Z-scheme heterojunction. Apart from that, the application of g-C3N4-based heterostructured photocatalysts in H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation and pollutant degradation will also be systematically presented.

Highly efficient, robust, and cost-effective catalysts are highly demanded for the near-future practical applications of CO2RR. Previous studies on atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen (M-N\n                        x\n                     ) sites constituted of earth abundant elements with maximum atom-utilization efficiency have demonstrated their performance towards CO2RR.

Developing green and sustainable strategies for NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions, using renewable energy, is strongly desired, by both industrial and scientific researchers. Artificial photosynthesis for ammonia synthesis, which has recently attracted significant attention, directly produces NH3 from sunlight, and N2 and H2O via photocatalysis. This has been regarded as an ideal, energy-saving and environmentally-benign process for NH3 production because it can be performed under normal temperature and atmospheric pressure using renewable solar energy. Although sustainable developments have been achieved since the pioneering work in 1977, many challenging issues (e.g., adsorption and activation of nitrogen molecules on the surface of photocatalysts under mild conditions) have still not been well solved and the photocatalytic activities are generally low. In this miniature review, I summarize the most recent progress of photocatalytic N2 fixation for ammonia synthesis, focusing specifically on two attractive aspects for adsorption and activation of nitrogen molecules: one is engineering of oxygen vacancies, and the other is mimicking natural nitrogenase for constructing artificial systems for N2 fixation. Several representative works focusing on these aspects in artificial systems have been reported recently, and it has been demonstrated that both factors play more significant roles in photocatalytic N2 reduction and fixation under ambient conditions. At the end of the review, I also give some remarks and perspective on the existing challenges and future directions in this field.", "Ni-based photocatalytic H2-production cocatalysts2\n             ": "Photocatalysis is believed to be one of the best methods to realize sustainable H2 production. However, achieving this through heterogeneous photocatalysis still remains a great challenge owing to the absence of active sites, sluggish surface reaction kinetics, insufficient charge separation, and a high thermodynamic barrier. Therefore, cocatalysts are necessary and of great significance in boosting photocatalytic H2 generation. This review will focus on the promising and appealing low-cost Ni-based H2-generation cocatalysts as the alternatives for the high-cost and low-abundance noble metal cocatalysts. Special emphasis has been placed on the design principle, modification strategies for further enhancing the activity and stability of Ni-based cocatalysts, and identification of the exact active sites and surface reaction mechanisms. Particularly, four types of modification strategies based on increased light harvesting, enhanced charge separation, strengthened interface interaction, and improved electrocatalytic activity have been thoroughly discussed and compared in detail. This review may open a new avenue for designing highly active and durable Ni-based cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 generation.", "Nanosized and hierarchical zeolites: A short review ": "Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with three-dimensional microporous structures. They have been used as ion-exchangers, catalysts, and adsorbents in various fields such as oil refining, petrochemistry, agriculture, and water and wastewater treatment. Their wide use is because of their many beneficial properties, such as framework and compositional flexibilities, physical and hydrothermal stabilities, non-toxicity, high surface areas, exchangeable cations, and good cost-benefit ratios. Although many zeolite applications depend on their microporous structures, this can cause diffusional constraints for bulky reactant and product molecules. There have been many efforts to overcome the intrinsic limitations of conventional zeolites by preparing nanosized and hierarchically structured zeolites. As a result of these efforts, several strategies have been established and the use of new zeolitic materials in various catalytic and adsorptive reactions has been investigated. Longer lifetimes, high catalytic performances, and postponed coking and catalyst deactivation can be achieved using hierarchical and nanosized zeolites. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the enhanced properties of hierarchical and nanosized zeolites, and recent development methods for their synthesis. The advantages and disadvantages of each route are discussed, and the catalytic applications of nanozeolites and zeolites with secondary porosity, and a comparison with conventional zeolites, are briefly presented.", "Photocatalysis fundamentals and surface modification of TiO2 nanomaterials ": "As a green and sustainable technology, heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductors has received much attention during the past decades because of its potential to address energy and environmental problems. Among various semiconductors, TiO2 has been regarded as the best and most widely investigated photocatalyst in the past 10 years. Based on the fundamentals of photocatalysis and surface chemistry of TiO2 nanomaterials, we herein summarize and discuss the achievements in the different surface modification strategies employed to date such as surface doping and sensitization, construction of surface heterojunctions, loading of nano-sized co-catalysts, increase in the accessible surface areas, and usage of surface F effects and exposure of highly reactive facets. Especially, the interesting synergistic effects of these different surface modification strategies deserve more attention in the near future. Studying these important advances in photocatalysis fundamentals, and surface chemistry and modification may offer new opportunities for designing highly efficient TiO2-based and non-TiO2-based photocatalysts for solar fuel production, environmental remediation, organic photosynthesis, and other related fields such as solar cell device fabrication, thermal catalysis, and separation and purification.", "Improved charge transfer by size-dependent plasmonic Au on C3N4 for efficient photocatalytic oxidation of RhB and CO2 reduction ": "A series of Au/g-C3N4 (Au/CN) nanocomposites were successfully prepared, where g-C3N4 nanosheets (CN NSs) served as a substrate for the growth of different sized Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) using the constant temperature bath-reduction method. The effect of Au NP size on electron transfer efficiency between the interfaces of the nanocomposite was studied. The three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain results revealed that larger Au NPs showed increased strength of the localized surface plasmon resonance effect. An increased number of high-energy electrons were available for transfer from Au NPs to CN under the visible light irradiation, inhibiting electron transfer from CN to Au NPs. Photoelectrochemical performance analysis showed that smaller Au NPs exhibited higher separation efficiency of the electron-hole pairs photo-generated with reasonable distribution density. These results are favorable for the improvement of photocatalytic performance. Compared to other nanocomposites, the 3-Au/CN sample (prepared using 3 mL HAuCl4 solution) with reasonable distribution density and small Au NPs exhibited the best photodegradation activity (92.66%) of RhB in 30 min under the visible light irradiation and photoreduction performance of CO2 to CO and CH4 with yields of 77.5 and 38.5 \u03bcmol/g, respectively, in 8 h under UV light irradiation. Considering the experimental results in the context of the literature, a corresponding size-dependent photocatalytic mechanism was proposed.", "Enhanced photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction and diclofenac sodium degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation over MIL-100(Fe)/g-C3N4 heterojunctions ": "Metal-organic framework MIL-100(Fe) and g-C3N4 heterojunctions (MG-x, x = 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, x is the mass fraction of MIL-100(Fe) in the hybrids) were facilely fabricated through ball-milling and annealing, and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible diffuse-reflectance spectrometry, and photoluminescence emission spectrometry. The photocatalytic activities of the series of MG-x heterojunctions toward Cr(VI) reduction and diclofenac sodium degradation were tested upon irradiation with simulated sunlight. The influence of different organic compounds (ethanol, citric acid, oxalic acid, and diclofenac sodium) as hole scavengers and the pH values (2, 3, 4, 6, and 8) on the photocatalytic activities of the series of MG-x heterojunctions was investigated. MG-20% showed superior photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction and diclofenac sodium degradation performance than did the individual MIL-100(Fe) and g-C3N4 because of the improved separation of photoinduced electron-hole charges, which was clarified via photoluminescence emission and electrochemical data. Moreover, the MG-x exhibited good reusability and stability after several runs.", "Preparation, characterization and catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts ": "Supported and colloidal single-atom catalysts (SACs), which possess excellent catalytic properties, are particularly important in both fundamental studies and practical applications. The progress made in the preparation methods, characterization, catalytic performances and mechanisms of SACs anchored to metal oxides, two-dimensional materials and the surface of metal nanoclusters (NCs) are reviewed. The different techniques for SAC fabrication, including conventional solution methods based on co-precipitation, incipient wetness co-impregnation, and the chemical vapor deposition method, as well as the newer atom layer deposition (ALD) and galvanic replacement methods, are summarized. The main results from experimental and theoretical studies of various catalytic reactions over SACs, including oxidation reactions, hydrogenation, water gas shift, photocatalytic H2 evolution and electrochemical reactions, are also discussed. Moreover, the electronic properties of the single atoms and their interactions with the supports are described to assist in understanding the origin of the high catalytic activity and selectivity of SACs. Finally, possible future research directions of SACs and their applications are proposed.", "Covalent organic frameworks as heterogeneous catalysts ": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), established as an emerging class of crystalline porous polymers with high surface area, structural diversity, and designability, attract much interest and exhibit potential applications in catalysis. In this review, we summarize the use of COFs as a versatile platform to develop heterogeneous catalysts for a variety of chemical reactions. Catalytic COFs are categorized in accordance with the types of active sites, involving single functional active sites, bifunctional active sites, and metal nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in pores. Special emphasis is placed on the deliberate or incidental synthesis strategies, the stability, the heterogeneity, and the shape/size selectivity for COF catalysis. Moreover, a description of the application of COFs as photocatalysts and electrocatalysts is presented. Finally, the prospects of COFs in catalysis and remaining issues in this field are indicated.", "Recent developments in metal phosphide and sulfide electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction ": "Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as an important half-reaction involved in water splitting, has been intensely studied since the last century. Transition metal phosphide and sulfide-based compounds have attracted increasing attention as active OER catalysts due to their excellent physical and chemical characters, and massive efforts have been devoted to improving the phosphide and sulfide-based materials with better activity and stability in recent years. In this review, the recent progress on phosphide and sulfide-based OER electrocatalysts in terms of chemical properties, synthetic methodologies, catalytic performances evaluation and improvement strategy is reviewed. The most accepted reaction pathways as well as the thermodynamics and electrochemistry of the OER are firstly introduced in brief, followed by a summary of the recent research and optimization strategy of phosphide and sulfide-based OER electrocatalysts.

The current understanding and enlightenment from foundation and development of ammonia synthesis catalyst are reviewed, and its future and facing new challenge remained today are expected. Catalytic ammonia synthesis technology has played a central role in the development of the chemical industry during the 20th century. During 100 years, ammonia synthesis catalyst has come through diversified seedtime such as Fe3O4-based iron catalysts, Fe1-x\n                     O-based iron catalysts, ruthenium-based catalysts, and discovery of a Co-Mo-N system. Often new techniques, methods, and theories of catalysis have initially been developed and applied in connection with studies of this system. Similarly, new discoveries in the field of ammonia synthesis have been extended to other fields of catalysis. There is no other practically relevant reaction that leads to such a close interconnection between theory, model catalysis, and experiment as the high-pressure synthesis of ammonia. Catalytic synthesis ammonia reaction is yet a perfect model system for academic research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the mechanism and the translation of the knowledge into technical perfection has become a fundamental criterion for scientific development in catalysis research. The never-ending story has not ended yet. In addition to questions about the elementary steps of the reaction and the importance of the real structure and subnitrides for the catalyst efficiency, as well as the wide-open question about new catalyst materials, there are also different challenges thrown down by theory for the experimentalist in the prediction of a biomimetic ammonia-synthesis path at room temperature and atmospheric pressure including electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and biomimetic nitrogen fixation.", "Review on heterophase/homophase junctions for efficient photocatalysis: The case of phase transition construction ": "Semiconductor photocatalysts are extensively applied in environmental treatment and energy conversion. However, one of their major disadvantages is their relatively low photocatalytic performance owing to the recombination of generated electron-hole pairs. The presence of the phase junction is an effective way to promote the photocatalytic activity by increasing the separation efficiency of the electron-hole pairs. Accordingly, extensive research has been conducted on the design of phase junctions of photocatalysts to improve their charge transfer properties and efficiencies. Therefore, for the design of an appropriate phase junction and the understanding of the mechanism of electron-hole separation, the development of the photocatalytic phase junction, including the preparation methods of the heterogeneous materials, is tremendously important and helpful. Herein, the commonly used, externally induced phase transformation fabrication techniques and the primary components of the semiconductors are reviewed. Future directions will still focus on the design and optimization of the phase junction of photocatalytic materials according to the phase transition with higher efficiencies for broadband responses and solar energy utilization. Additionally, the most popular phase transformation fabrication techniques of phase junctions are briefly reviewed from the application viewpoint.", "Single atom gold catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation ": "Low-temperature CO oxidation is important for both fundamental studies and practical applications. Supported gold catalysts are generally regarded as the most active catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation. The active sites are traditionally believed to be Au nanoclusters or nanoparticles in the size range of 0.5\u20135 nm. Only in the last few years have single-atom Au catalysts been proved to be active for CO oxidation. Recent advances in both experimental and theoretical studies on single-atom Au catalysts unambiguously demonstrated that when dispersed on suitable oxide supports the Au single atoms can be extremely active for CO oxidation. In this mini-review, recent advances in the development of Au single-atom catalysts are discussed, with the aim of illustrating their unique catalytic features during CO oxidation.", "A review of the direct oxidation of methane to methanol ": "This article briefly reviewed the advances in the process of the direct oxidation of methane to methanol (DMTM) with both heterogeneous and homogeneous oxidation. Attention was paid to the conversion of methane by the heterogeneous oxidation process with various transition metal oxides. The most widely studied catalysts are based on molybdenum and iron. For the homogeneous gas phase oxidation, several process control parameters were discussed. Reactor design has the most crucial role in determining its commercialization. Compared to the above two systems, aqueous homogenous oxidation is an efficient route to get a higher yield of methanol. However, the corrosive medium in this method and its serious environmental pollution hinder its widespread use. The key challenge to the industrial application is to find a green medium and highly efficient catalysts.", "CdS-modified one-dimensional g-C3N4 porous nanotubes for efficient visible-light photocatalytic conversion ": "A heterojunction photocatalyst based on porous tubular g-C3N4 decorated with CdS nanoparticles was fabricated by a facile hydrothermal co-deposition method. The one-dimensional porous structure of g-C3N4 provides a higher specific surface area, enhanced light absorption, and better separation and transport performance of charge carriers along the longitudinal direction, all of which synergistically contribute to the superior photocatalytic activity observed. The significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency is also a benefit originating from the fast transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes between g-C3N4 and CdS through a built-in electric field, which was confirmed by investigating the morphology, structure, optical properties, electrochemical properties, and photocatalytic activities. Photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction were also carried out to investigate its photocatalytic performance. RhB can be degraded completely within 60 min, and the optimum H2 evolution rate of tubular g-C3N4/CdS composite is as high as 71.6 \u03bcmol h\u22121, which is about 16.3 times higher than that of pure bulk g-C3N4. The as-prepared nanostructure would be suitable for treating environmental pollutants as well as for water splitting.", "Rational design of hydrogenation catalysts using nitrogen-doped porous carbon ": "", "Electronic interaction between single Pt atom and vacancies on boron nitride nanosheets and its influence on the catalytic performance in the direct dehydrogenation of propane ": "The electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) is one of most intriguing phenomena in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, this subtle effect is clearly demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of single Pt atom supported on vacancies in a boron nitride nanosheet. Moreover, the relation between the EMSI and the performance of Pt in propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is investigated in detail. The charge state and partial density of states of single Pt atom show distinct features at different anchoring positions, such as boron and nitrogen vacancies (Bvac and Nvac respectively). Single Pt atom become positively and negatively charged on Bvac and Nvac, respectively. Therefore, the electronic structure of Pt can be adjusted by rational deposition on the support. Moreover, Pt atoms in different charge states have been shown to have different catalytic abilities in PDH. The DFT calculations reveal that Pt atoms on Bvac (Pt-Bvac) have much higher reactivity towards reactant/product adsorption and C\u2013H bond activation than Pt supported on Nvac (Pt-Nvac), with larger adsorption energy and lower barrier along the reaction pathway. However, the high reactivity of Pt-Bvac also hinders propene desorption, which could lead to unwanted deep dehydrogenation. Therefore, the results obtained herein suggest that a balanced reactivity for C\u2013H activation in propane and propene desorption is required to achieve optimum yields. Based on this descriptor, a single Pt atom on a nitrogen vacancy is considered an effective catalyst for PDH. Furthermore, the deep dehydrogenation of the formed propene is significantly suppressed, owing to the large barrier on Pt-Nvac. The current work demonstrates that the catalytic properties of supported single Pt atoms can be tuned by rationally depositing them on a boron nitride nanosheet and highlights the great potential of single-atom catalysis in the PDH reaction.", "Photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction based on metalloporphyrin-modified TiO2 photocathode ": "The conversion of CO2 and water to value-added chemicals under sunlight irradiation, especially by photoelectrocatalytic reduction process, is always a dream for human beings. A new artificial photosynthesis system composed of a metalloporphyrin-functionalized TiO2 photocathode and BiVO4 photoanode can efficiently transform CO2 and water to methanol, which is accompanied by oxygen release. This photoelectrocatalytic system smoothly produces methanol at a rate of 55.5 \u00b5M h\u22121 cm\u2212 2, with 0.6 V being the membrane voltage in plants. The production of hydrogen can also be observed when the voltage is more than 0.75 V, due to photocatalysis. Our results evidently indicate that the molecules of metalloporphyrin attached onto the surface of anatase (TiO2) behave as chlorophyll, NADP, and Calvin cycle in plant cells.", "Thermal catalysis under dark ambient conditions in environmental remediation: Fundamental principles, development, and challenges ": "Thermal catalytic degradation of organic pollutants conducted in the dark at room temperature under atmospheric pressure without the need of external chemicals and energy sources has attracted a lot of attention over the last two decades. It provides unparalleled advantages over other advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in treating domestic and industrial contaminated wastewater from the viewpoint of energy/chemical conservation and ease of operation. Rich knowledge has been accumulated in terms of the synthesis and application of thermal catalysts though controversies remain regarding their underlying mechanisms. This review sheds light on the proposed thermo-catalysis mechanism for the first time and presents the development of thermal catalysts under dark ambient conditions with a focus on catalyst materials, catalytic activity, and mechanism. The present review aims to provide mechanistic insights into the rational design of novel and efficient catalysts, and their underlying mechanisms as well as the emerging challenges and perspectives in thermo-catalysis under dark ambient conditions used for the practical and efficient treatment of contaminated wastewater.", "Highlights of the major progress in single-atom catalysis in 2015 and 2016 ": "The idea that single metal atoms dispersed on a solid support can act as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst was raised in 2011 when single Pt atoms on an FeO\n                        x\n                      surface were reported to be active for CO oxidation and preferential oxidation of CO in H2. The last six years have witnessed tremendous progress in the field of single-atom catalysis. Here we introduce the major achievements on this topic in 2015 and 2016. Some particular aspects of single-atom catalysis are discussed in depth, including new approaches in single-atom catalyst (SAC) synthesis, stable gold SACs for various reactions, the high selectivity of Pt and Pd SACs in hydrogenation, and the superior performance of non-noble metal SACs in electrochemistry. These accomplishments will encourage more efforts by researchers to achieve the controllable fabrication of SACs and explore their potential applications.", "Laser-direct-writing of 3D self-supported NiS2/MoS2 heterostructures as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline and neutral electrolytes ": "Searching for low-cost widely applicable electrocatalysts for hydrogen production is very important. Here, 3D self-supported NiS2/MoS2 heterostructures were synthesized via a one-step millisecond-laser-direct-writing method; these structures exhibited excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activities over a wide pH range. The current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 could be reached at low overpotentials of 98 and 159 mV in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively. Such an outstanding electrocatalytic performance should be attributed to the integration of the 3D self-supported nanostructures, the high conductivity of the framework, and particularly, the incalculable heterointerfaces formed between NiS2 and MoS2. This work provides a new strategy to study interfacial engineering and the mechanism of interface enhancement.", "Landslide mapping and monitoring by using radar and optical remote sensing: Examples from the EC-FP7 project SAFER ": "This paper focuses on the Landslide Thematic services of the EU-funded FP7-SPACE project SAFER (Services and Applications For Emergency Response) for inventory mapping, monitoring and rapid mapping by using Earth Observation (EO). We exploited satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA), and discuss example applications in South Tyrol and Abruzzo (Italy), Lower Austria (Austria), Lubietova (Slovakia) and the Kaohsiung County (Taiwan). These case studies showcase the significance of radar and optical EO data, InSAR and OBIA methods for landslide mapping and monitoring in different geological environments and during all phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, crisis and recovery.", "Remote sensing and GIS techniques for prediction of land use land cover change effects on soil erosion in the high basin of the Oum Er Rbia River (Morocco) ": "Soil erosion by water is one of the most important causes of land degradation throughout the world, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. The high basin of the Oum Er Rbia River, located in the Middle Atlas (Morocco), is a mountainous area dominated by steep slopes and clayey soils, which make it vulnerable to soil erosion due to human activities and severe weather. Multidate satellite images of Sentinel 2A, Landsat Oli-8 and ETM acquired respectively in 2017, 2013 and 2003, and the Cellular Automata Markov (CA_Markov) model were used to forecast the land use/land cover map and their change detections. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was integrated in a GIS environment to quantify soil loss and to map erosion risk of the specific years.\n                  The estimated annual soil losses average was 58\u202ft\u202fha\u22121 yr\u22121 in 2003, and the predicted annual soil loss average for 2030 was 142 60\u202ft\u202fha\u22121 yr\u22121. The results demonstrate that using CA_Marcov and RUSLE in combination with remote sensing and GIS is a suitable method for forecasting LUCC and accurately measuring the quantity of soil losses in the future.", "Mapping soil salinity in arid and semi-arid regions using Landsat 8 OLI satellite data ": "Soil salinity, whether natural or human induced, is a major geo-hazard in arid and semi-arid landscapes. In agricultural lands, it negatively affects plant growth, crop yields, whereas in semi-arid and arid non-agricultural areas it affects urban structures due to subsidence, corrosion and ground water quality, leading to further soil erosion and land degradation. Accurately mapping soil salinity through remote sensing techniques has been an active area of research in the past few decades particularly for agricultural lands. Most of this research has focused on the utilization and development of salinity indices for properly mapping and identifying saline agricultural soils. This research develops a soil salinity index and model using Landsat 8 OLI image data from the near infra-red and shortwave infra-red spectral information with emphasis on soil salinity mapping and assessment in non-agricultural desert arid and semi-arid surfaces. The developed index when integrated into a semi-empirical model outperformed in its soil salinity mapping overall accuracy (60%) in comparison to other salinity indices (~50%). The newly developed index further outperformed other indices in its accuracy in mapping and identifying high saline soils (67%) and excessively high saline soils (90%).", "Review of remotely sensed data products for disease mapping and epidemiology ": "High resolution remotely sensed (RS) data products remain of interest in disease mapping studies. However, previous usage of such satellite-derived products had been limited by high costs. There is also unprecedented space activity characterized by prolific satellite launches for various purposes, the chief of which being land cover observation. Therefore, there is need for information availability on the type of data products obtainable from the captured satellite images in order to facilitate access and utilization. Clearly, the remote sensing landscape is changing with the advent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle/drones and spatially explicit images being captured at relatively low costs. We conducted a review to find out which RS data products were accessible for disease mapping and epidemiology. Our aim was to document RS data products for disease mapping and to propose other such products that could be incorporated in disease mapping and epidemiology studies. In view of the fact that RS data products are rapidly evolving, image data of higher spatial and temporal resolutions in near-real time are already available to aid disease mapping. We presented a catalogue of indices from ecological studies that could be used as variables in disease mapping and epidemiology. Remotely sensed data products related to climate, meteorology, land use/cover, cartography and urban mapping are explored as potential indices for disease mapping. There remains a substantial amount of work to be conducted on the evaluation and validation of some of the indices presented in this study. Conversely, synergies between remote sensing experts and epidemiologists could be useful in the uptake and testing of some of the proposed RS data products presented in this work.", "The use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology and GIS in the assessment and mapping of bioresources in Davao Region, Mindanao Island, Philippines ": "Davao Region is one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the Philippines. It is the country's top producer of banana and coconut. In this study, light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology was employed for the accurate assessment of agricultural, coastal and forest resources in Davao Region. A total area of 5799\u202fkm2 of LiDAR data were processed into bioresource maps for the municipalities in Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, and Compostela Valley. The high resolution (0.5\u202fm) maps provided detailed information on spatial variation of existing bioresources. The LIDAR-generated maps facilitated the understanding of varying ecological, public health, social, economic and management processes. The utilization and management of bioresources in Davao Region is crucial for sustainable economic development of Mindanao Island, Philippines.", "Comparison of different reflectance indices for vegetation analysis using Landsat-TM data ": "Several reflectance indices based on digital satellite data are used to describe phytosociological characteristics of vegetation. The present study was aimed at comparing the reflectance indices- simple ratio (SR), difference vegetation index (DVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), nonlinear index (NLI), aerosol free vegetation index (AFRI) and green chlorophyll index (GCI) for phytosociological characteristics of vegetation in the vicinity of river Beas in India, over a stretch of 63\u202fkm from the towns of Beas to Harike in the state of Punjab, India. Factor analysis (FA) was applied to the reflectance values of different bands and phytosociological measures. Unitless \u03b2-regression coefficients in multiple linear regression analysis give the relative importance of an independent variable eliminating the effect of other variables. Commonly used reflectance indices regressed on phytosociological variables revealed that NDVI followed by NLI explained maximum variability in density, biomass, Shannon's index and Simpson's index. GCI followed by DVI, and SR followed by DVI explained maximum variability in abundance and Margalef's index respectively. ANN models fitted well to the data. The correlations between the predicated vs observed values from ANN for density, biomass, abundance, Shannon's, Simpson's and Margalef's indices were highly significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). This is the first baseline study in the vicinity of river Beas, and further studies are required to understand the changes in the pattern of vegetation and their correlation with the satellite data.", "Effect of using crop specific masks on earth observation based crop yield forecasting across Canada ": "Land cover maps are often required in Earth Observation (EO) data analysis to isolate regions where specific land classes are present. They are normally derived from remote sensing images and ground truthed inputs. The crop cover maps that target specific crop classes \u2013 herein referred to as \u201ccrop masks\u201d \u2013 could be used to identify the pixels that represent the targeted class, which in-turn could potentially improve the inputs for agricultural applications such as crop-specific yield forecasting. In this study, a set of crop-specific masks derived from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's (AAFC) annual space-based crop inventory was evaluated for use in forecasting the regional and national yields of five major crops (spring wheat, barley, canola, corn for grain and soybean). Yield forecast results from these masks were compared with the generalized masking approach used operationally by AAFC and Statistics Canada (STC). This comparison was undertaken using two model performance indicators, the Bravais and Pearson coefficient of determination and the root mean squared error, computed using a Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) procedure. Yield modelling was conducted at the Census Agricultural Region (CAR), and then aggregated to the provincial and national scales. Overall, an improvement in yield forecasting skill was observed when crop-specific masks were used for all crops in certain regions and at certain spatial scales. However, only the corn and soybean mask showed consistent improvement across spatial scales for most crop growing regions. For spring wheat, canola and barley, improvements were mostly observed in regions where crops are sparsely distributed or clustered. The results of this study will provide further guidance in developing and refining the current crop-specific masks for use in yield forecasting estimates.", "Capturing heterogeneous urban growth using SLEUTH model ": "Increasing urbanization, especially in developing countries, promotes the need of monitoring and modelling of urban growth or sprawl. Urban remote sensing and modelling are the tools which facilitate assessment and prediction of urban growth. In the present work, spatio-temporal variations in urban growth has been studied using 22 years of multi-spectral remote sensing data for Pushkar Town in India. The CA (Cellular Automata) based SLEUTH model has been used in the present study for urban growth modelling, which is one of the most promising urban growth model and widely used throughout the world. The self-modifying parameters in SLEUTH model play a crucial role in identifying and controlling the temporal urban growth rate during model calibration and urban growth prediction. Present study is aimed to determine the SLEUTH model sensitivity to self-modifying parameter and also to identify the influence of self-modifying parameters on fragmented urban growth, urban growth pattern and spatial & temporal distribution of growth. The study revealed the need of sensitivity analysis of SLEUTH model parameters which are critically affecting simulation process in identifying fragmented urban growth, in areas where built-up unit sizes are small, built-up practices are heterogeneous and scattered. Study has been found to be successful in quantifying the model sensitivity to self-modifying parameters and in identifying different urban forms like clustered, dispersed, edge, road influenced, compact and spreading center growth. The study is important for research community, urban planners and land use policy decision makers.", "Remote sensing of large reservoir in the drought years: Implications on surface water change and turbidity variability of Sobradinho reservoir (Northeast Brazil) ": "Sobradinho reservoir has been suffering a severe water loss caused by multi-year drought in the Northeast Brazil. This reservoir contributes to the socio-economic development of the semi-arid region, and the monitoring of water shortage is crucial for people living in this climate-vulnerable region. In this study, we evaluate the surface water change and turbidity variability of Sobradinho reservoir during recent drought years (2013\u20132017). A time-series dataset was created using 109 Landsat-8 OLI images for mapping the water extent in the reservoir. A non-linear regression between measured turbidity and surface reflectance (red band) was developed and applied for turbidity retrievals. Additionally, we performed a long-term precipitation analysis (17-year) to assess the rainfall deficit over the catchment area. Our results show that the annual precipitation regimes are below the long-term average during 2012\u20132017 period, except 2013. We also found that negative anomalies occur during 26 out of 36 months between 2014 and 2016, mostly in the rainy season. Since the rainfall regimes and river discharges are the major drivers for water recharge, these drought years have a critical impact on the reservoir level. According to our results, the water surface receded about 2073\u202fkm2 (out of total 3303\u202fkm2) during September 2017; this represents a reduction of 62.8% in the total water extent. The surface water change is spatially distinct across the reservoir. For instance, the upper section of the reservoir was almost totally dried during September 2017, and the water coverage was ~8% (91.25\u202fkm2 out of 1128\u202fkm2). Although other sections had a relatively low water change (reduction of ~40%), the losses are significant in terms of area (~1035.5\u202fkm2). The receding of water extent affects the people living near to the reservoir, and local communities are more distant from water (up to 13\u202fkm). We also observed that the turbidity is seasonally dependent, and water clarity presents a strong variability between rainy and dry seasons. In general, the turbidity levels vary from clear water (0\u201320 NTU) during the dry season to turbid condition (>50 NTU) during the rainy season. A lack of access to clean and safe drinking water in some periods might be harmful to humans, livestock and domestic animals. Finally, this research contributes to the assessment of drought-related impacts in the Sobradinho, the largest reservoir in the Northeast Brazil. The water shortage is a recurring concern in the semi-arid region, and the remote sensing techniques provide spatially explicit information to enhance the livelihood resilience during drought years.", "Urban land cover dynamics and their impact on ecosystem services in Kigali, Rwanda using multi-temporal Landsat data ": "Land cover change monitoring in rapidly urbanizing environments based on spaceborne remotely sensed data and measurable indicators is essential for quantifying and evaluating the spatial patterns of urban landscape change dynamics and for sustainable urban ecosystems management. The objectives of the study are to analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of urbanization patterns of Kigali, Rwanda over the last three decades (from 1984 to 2016) using multi-temporal Landsat data and to assess the associated environmental impact using landscape metrics and ecosystem services. Visible and infrared bands of Landsat images were combined with derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) variance texture and digital elevation model (DEM) data for pixel-based classification using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Seven land cover classes were derived with an overall accuracy exceeding 87% with Kappa coefficients around 0.8. As most prominent changes, cropland was reduced considerably in favour of built-up areas that increased from 2.13\u202fkm2 to 100.17\u202fkm2 between 1984 and 2016. During those 32 years, landscape fragmentation could be observed, especially for forest and cropland. The landscape configuration indices demonstrate that in general the land cover pattern remained stable for cropland, but that it was highly changed for built-up areas. Ecosystem services considered include regulating, provisioning and support services. Estimated changes in ecosystem services amount to a loss of 69 million US dollars (USD) as a result of cropland degradation in favour of urban areas and in a gain of 52.5 million USD within urban areas. Multi-temporal remote sensing is found as a cost-effective method for analysis and quantification of urbanization and its effects using landscape metrics and ecosystem services.", "GIS model-builder based on comprehensive geostatistical approach to assess soil quality ": "A comprehensive assessment was carried out for the soil quality of Abo-Hammad County, El-Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. In this regard, an integrated approach involving geostatistical, correlation matrix, is used to evaluate selected soil physio-chemical properties. This study is established to identify appropriate indicators for assessing soil quality rapidly and economically. Analytical data were gathered from representative 53 soil profiles covering most neighborhoods of the county. The results show that ordinary cokriging has the best fit for the geostatistical methods. Soils of the high soil quality occupy 35.4% of the county; those of the intermediate quality occupy 38.0%, whereas; those of the low soil quality occupy 26.6%. In the case of soil physiochemical properties, the largest part of the soils has medium to large values of these parameters. The largest part of the analyzed soil samples are characterized by low values in term of soil biological properties. This study indicated a relatively high variability in soil properties showed important in considering some parameters for calculation of soil quality index. The spatial variability patterns of soil properties were identified and mapped. The results demonstrated that management of soil practices should be carefully associated with soil texture. Based on the comparison of soil quality of soil data 2015 and soil data 1995, was found a deterioration of soil quality. Soil productiveness may affected by intensive agriculture practices and mismanagement. This study may enhance knowledge regarding soil agricultural practices in the study area and introduce a better technique to analyze soil quality index by multivariate geostatistical methods.", "Quantitative assessment of soil saline degradation using remote sensing indices in Siwa Oasis ": "Unsuitable practices and improper land management lead to soil degradation and therefore deviates land from optimum productivity. Remote sensing indices and spatial variability of soil properties were implemented in Arc GIS model-Builder for quantitative assessment of land degradation in Siwa Oasis, western desert, Egypt. Semivariogram model through Kriging techniques was used to produce maps of soil properties in two dates 2002 and 2017. This was done in order to calculate soil degradation rates and its areas in the studied area. The results indicated that geostatistical approach and ArcGIS model-builder can directly reveal the spatial variability of soil properties and measure accurately the changes in soil properties. The results will help the farmers and decision makers for improving the soil-water management. The cross-validation results illustrated the smoothing effect of the spatial prediction. Physical and chemical properties of 90 soil profiles were analyzed and chemical parameters were analyzed of 30 groundwater sample, collected from irrigation-wells. Landsat images of five different periods were collected to monitor the changes of the surface features of soil salinity and water logging. Soil analyses show a wide variability. The very saline, non-sodic soils cover most of the suited soils. Agricultural areas, saline soils and water logged areas were increased. The increment of saline soil and water logged areas is associated with poor drainage and increment in crop irrigation. There is degradation in groundwater quality which indicated by its salinity. The studied soils are salt-affected and this prompts the need of a proper land reclamation program and prods the development of effective irrigation and drainage systems.", "Characterisation of invasive plant proliferation within remnant riparian green corridors in Lusaka District of Zambia using Sentinel-2 imagery ": "Natural riparian corridors can serve as biodiversity reservoirs in urban environments. Despite the many opportunities that riparian corridors present for biodiversity conservation within urban environments, they may present conservation challenges by providing a thriving hub for local and alien invasive plants. The aim of the study was to map and characterise the occurrence of local and alien invasive plants along the natural green riparian corridors in Lusaka district of Zambia. A combination of field surveys and remote sensing approaches using Sentinel-2 imagery were employed to conduct the vegetation mapping and characterise the invasive plant proliferation. Five local and nine alien invasive plant species were identified within the natural green riparian corridors at 23 field survey sites. A total of 108 plant species were recorded in the study area out of which 57 were grasses of the Poacea family, five were local invasive and nine were alien invasive plant species. Six of the invasive plant species were mapped using Sentinel-2 data. The study showed that 47.35% of areal extent of the natural green riparian corridors in Lusaka had invasive and alien plant presence. Invasive and alien plant richness was determined to affect non-invasive plant richness and diversity. There was no linear association between poverty and percentage cover of invasive plant species but percentage cover of invasive plants seemed to be concentrated around wards with a poverty headcount around 0.15. The outcomes of this research are relevant for the management of invasive species within natural green corridors in urban areas.", "Quantitative analysis of water balance components in Lake Urmia, Iran using remote sensing technology ": "Accurate quantification of water balance components in large lakes is of great importance in assessing the changes in hydrological components, and subsequent variations in lakes water balance. The water balance of Urmia Lake in northwestern Iran was quantitatively analyzed in the year 2005 using remotely-sensed data (e.g. evapotranspiration and precipitation) and meteorological data. The analysis was based on GIS operations. For this purpose, the estimation of pixel-scaled monthly evapotranspiration (ET) was conducted via the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) using time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and meteorological data; precipitation was derived from the monthly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observations; surface runoff was estimated by the empirical formula; and finally, the computations of recharge were carried out using the water balance approach for the winter months where estimation of ET and surface runoff were subtracted from precipitation. Water balance components were quantified for the lake and the lake basin separately. Results showed that the water balance components calculated by remote sensing were in conformity with the reported figures in the literature. According to the results of the water balance method, Urmia Lake was suffering from a negative water balance of 3443 MCM yr\u22121. Findings of this study demonstrated the application of the derived satellite data in estimating lake's water balance components in order to improve the accuracy of the lake water budget calculation.", "Estimating urban areas: New insights from very high-resolution human settlement data ": "Estimation of the built-up areas is fundamental to studying urbanization and the concomitant impacts on our rapidly changing planet. Local-scale mapping of the built-up areas elucidates spatially distinct patterns of urban densification as well as peri-urban growth, where the most socially vulnerable population traditionally resides, and helps to ensure sustainable and equitable urban development. Due to the scale and spatial dependency of urban processes, most land use and land cover (LULC) data produced at national and regional scales cannot adequately capture this local variation which is readily observed in very high-resolution (\n                        \u2264\n                     0.5\u202fm) remotely sensed images.\n                  Our study investigates whether human settlement data derived from very high-resolution images provide unique understanding in the mapping of built-up areas and further the knowledge of human signatures at local levels. We selected two disparate geographies, Egypt and Taiwan, for which we analyzed four datasets representing human settlements at different spatial resolutions. Our analysis of urban morphology is based on aggregation, complexity, and contiguity of built-up areas on these settlement data and conducted at multiple spatial scales corresponding to the original resolution of the datasets. The results indicate that estimates of the total built-up area are severely misconceived, with most anomalies occurring along fringe areas. This work also illustrates the potential of high-resolution datasets to provide new insight into urban dynamics, through determining new measures of built-up area and identifying complex urban and peri-urban patterns that were previously undetected.", "Urban green spaces supply in rapidly urbanizing countries: The case of Sebeta Town, Ethiopia ": "Urban green space has gradually become an integral part of urban development strategies due to its important role in providing space for multiple ecosystem services for human well-being. Even though urban green spaces have multiple benefits, they are under strong pressure particularly in rapidly developing cities of sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we analyzed urban green space changes and their drivers in Sebeta town of Ethiopia from 2003 to 2016 by using three time series Landsat images of 2003, 2010 and 2016, land inventory, interview, focus group discussion, and field observation for data collection and a combination of techniques, including pixel based image classification, qualitative descriptive and GIS-based processing for data analyses. The findings of the study show that area of green space has decreased by 51.8% at the rate of 3.9% annual loss between the year 2003\u20132016 while the built-up area increased by 562.1% at the rate of 43.2% annual growth. Specifically, the study shows that about 1410.7\u202fha of green space were converted to built-up areas during the study period. The drivers for the change were physical expansion of the built-up area, population growth, high land value, laxity in the enforcement of planning regulations, corruption, lack of coordination between institutions, and limited awareness of the community about the benefits of green spaces. The study suggests strengthening of plan implementation capacity, public participation in urban planning and strengthening of the development control and urban green spaces management system as an important strategy to increases the supply of green spaces in urban centers.", "Improving NDVI by removing cirrus clouds with optical remote sensing data from Landsat-8 \u2013 A case study in Quito, Ecuador ": "The Andean region has a high cloud density throughout the year. The use of optical remote sensing data in the computation of environmental indices of this region has been hampered by the presence of clouds. To maximize accuracy in the computation of several environmental indices including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), we compared the performance of two algorithms in removing clouds in Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data of a high-elevation area. The study area was Quito, Ecuador, which is a city located close to the equator and in a high-elevation area crossed by the Andes Mountains. The first algorithm was the automatic cloud removal method (ACRM), which employs a linear regression between the different spectral bands and the cirrus band. The second algorithm was independent component analysis (ICA), which considers the noise (clouds) as part of independent components applied over the study area. These methods were evaluated based on several images from different years with different cloud conditions. The results indicate that neither algorithm is effective over this region for the removal of clouds or for NDVI computation. However, after improving ACRM, the NDVI computed using ACRM showed a better correlation than ICA with the MODIS NDVI product.", "Performances of WorldView 3, Sentinel 2, and Landsat 8 data in mapping impervious surface ": "Many efforts have been made to map developed impervious surface from remotely sensed information in the last two decades. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to provide consistent land cover and change products for the Nation since 2001. Percent impervious surface area (ISA), one of the products in NLCD as a continuous field and estimated with Landsat imagery, represents the fraction of human-made impervious area in a 30\u202fm resolution grid. ISA is used to map urban land cover types and extents for the United States. However, it is still a challenge to quantify highly heterogeneous features in many urban areas using remotely sensed data with spatial and spectral resolutions similar to Landsat and to determine the impacts of remotely sensed data characteristics on ISA mapping.", "Critical analysis of rural-urban transitions and transformations in Lucknow city, India ": "An unplanned urban sprawl is emerging as a major threat for urban development, especially in developing countries. In recent decades, ever increasing population and urbanization has led to the urban sprawl. The dynamic nature of urbanization creates ambiguities in measurements of urbanization growth and its extent. Temporal analysis of land-use/land-cover (LULC) and identification of transition points are required for sustainable development of the city. Therefore, the sustainable model is required for critical analysis of urbanization and its impact. This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urbanization process at an urban, suburban, sub-rural and rural level that has occurred in Lucknow, the capital city of the state Uttar Pradesh of India. The micro-level study has been performed to measure the extent and growth of urbanization. The model is processed using remotely sensed satellite data of Landsat sensor of the year 1995, 2005 and 2016. The workflow is initiated using LULC classification map of two decades 1995\u20132016. The classification result depicts an increased built-up area i.e., 77.15 sq. km to 143.70 sq. km from 1995 to 2005 and increased to 199.92 sq. km from 2005 to 2016. The accuracy assessment of LULC is found to be 90%, 92% and 94% for 1995, 2005 and 2016 respectively. The micro- level analysis is performed using urban landscape quantification in which urbanness analysis of each pixel is estimated and then the pixel is allocated according to built-up densities of spatial area. Further these densities are classified in seven classes those are (i) Urban built-up, (ii) Suburban built-up, (iii) Rural built-up, (iv) Urbanized open land (UOL), (v) Captured open land (COL), (vi) Rural open land (ROL) and, (vii) Water. Finally, the urban footprint maps are generated using the results of urban landscape quantification. The critical and detailed analysis of the peri-urban interface (PUI) is performed by demarcating the villages where significant changes are observed and integrated with the driving factors responsible for the changes. The expansion analysis is performed for quantifying the sprawl taking place in the city. Mainly four types of expansions are identified and mapped that are infill, extension, leapfrog and ribbon expansions. Land surface temperature (LST) analysis is performed over the study area for analyzing the adverse effect of urbanization over the transition points (Villages). Land surface temperature variation has been monitored over these transition points and their unfavorable effects on the environment.", "Vulnerability to storm surge flood using remote sensing and GIS techniques: A study on Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India ": "Assessment of vulnerability to storm surge flood is not only significant for the survival of the exposed communities but also for adaptation. Defining vulnerability as the function of exposure, sensitivity and resilience capacity, we propose a composite vulnerability index (CVI) to assess village- level vulnerability to storm surge flood in the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India. The composite vulnerability index based analysis revealed that of the total villages (1063) located in SBR; nearly half of the villages are highly and very highly vulnerable with least capacity to cope with any kind of extreme event. The villages located in the southern parts and adjacent to coast were found more vulnerable to storm surge while those located at higher elevation in the central part showed low vulnerability. Some villages in northern part of the region were under high and very high vulnerability due to presence of low lying and waterlogged wetlands. The findings of the study may have implications for developing resilience capacity in response to storm surge flooding. Thus, the methodology can help the local policymakers in integrating local multi-hazards knowledge and in making information actionable for mitigation and adaptation of storm surge flood hazard.", "Chlorophyll estimation using multi-spectral unmanned aerial system based on machine learning techniques ": "Remote sensing for precision agriculture is a proven tool for efficient management of crop inputs. High spatial and temporal resolutions are requisite for accurate and timely estimate of crop parameters. We made an attempt to estimatetheleaf chlorophyll concentration of standing maize plant from high resolution (5\u202fcm) multi-spectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. The UAV images in Green, Red, Red-Edge and NIR bands of standing maize fields under various nutrient induced abiotic stresses were acquired by flying a hexacopter at an elevation of 60\u202f\u202fm\u202fat ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Meghalaya. A handheld spectroradiometer was also used to record the spectra in 1024 bands, ranging from 350\u202fnm to 2500\u202fnm to support the UAV study. We evaluated advanced machine learning algorithms combined with spectral data and ground truth chlorophyll to model the chlorophyll estimates. Algorithms included Support vector regression, Relevance vector regression, Gaussian process regression, Kernel ridge regression and Random forest with K-fold cross validation. The multivariate analysis applied on spectroradiometer and UAV data showed the dominance of Red-band for chlorophyll prediction with R2 values greater than 0.80. Among the machine learning algorithms, we found the Kernel-Ridge regression was most robust method for developing chlorophyll estimation model with minimal RMSE (0.057 mg/gm) and regression coefficient of determination (R2\u202f=\u202f0.904). The relevance vector machine also predicted chlorophyll concentration satisfactorily (R2\u202f=\u202f0.87 with RMSE of 0.06 mg/gm), but took larger training time. The optimization and hybridisation of kernel based algorithms is further needed to enhance the reliability of models for prediction of leaf chlorophyll concentrations.", "Land use land cover changes along topographic gradients in Hugumburda national forest priority area, Northern Ethiopia ": "This study investigated the influence of topographic variability on land use land cover (LULC) change in Hugumburda national forest priority area. The study was based on three periods of LULC maps derived from satellite imageries: Landsat TM for 1985, Landsat ETM+ for 2000 and Landsat OLI for 2015, and topographic attributes derived from ASTER digital elevation model. Supervised image classification was carried out using Maximum Likelihood classifier algorithm. Changes in LULC vis-a-vis topographic variability (altitude, slope and aspect) were assessed based on overlay analysis in a GIS environment. Six LULC classes were identified with an overall accuracy of 93% and Kappa statistics of 0.90. Shrubland and forest land were the dominant LULC types which respectively accounted for about 36% and 26% in 1985 and 39% and 33% in 2000. Forest land (35%) followed by shrubland (30%) continued to be the dominant LULC types in 2015. Between 1985 and 2015, about 23% of the study area showed changes in LULC which constitute increase in forest cover by about 715 ha mainly at the expense of shrubland. Steep slopes, higher altitudes and Northeast aspect were important topographic attributes where marked increased in forest cover was observed.\u00a0The increase in forest cover along steep slopes, higher altitudes and Northeast aspect can be used to stimulate further expansion of forest cover along similar topographic conditions. This study demonstrated that topographic variability plays an important role in controlling LULC changes. Detailed investigation of drivers of the increased in forest cover is required to scale up the success in other regions with similar climatic and topographic settings.", "Assessing and modeling the impact of land use and changes in land cover related to carbon storage in a western basin in Mexico ": "In this study, we analyzed the land use and land cover (LULC) change in a hydrologic basin in the western coast of central Mexico and its regional variation in carbon storage. Three thematic maps (1986, 2001 and 2017) were produced by using pixel-based unsupervised classification techniques of Landsat images. LULC maps for 2017, 2033 and 2050 were modeled using a Cellular Automata Markov chain, validating their predictive power using Kappa variations. The InVEST software was used to estimate the carbon stored in four reservoirs, analyzing their variations over time (1986\u20132050). Accuracy assessment for the classifications revealed satisfactory results with an Overall accuracy of 83% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.76. Results show that the main landscape modifier was the exposed soils class increasing by 65% its extent in 1986, with a net increase around 87,900\u202fha. The evergreen forest (EF) and the tropical dry forest (TDF) classes showed a decrease along the period analyzed, displaying a net loss of 57,200\u202fha and 47,200\u202fha, respectively. Projected land cover changes followed the same trend observed, with a decreasing tendency in the EF and TDF coverages as consequence of exposed soil class increase. This change implies a reduction in the estimated total carbon stock, decreasing from 362.9 Tg C in 1986, to 336.2 Tg C in 2017. According to our model, if the trend detected in this analysis continues, it is expected a reduction to 317.9 Tg C in 2050. This approach combining Cellular Automata and Markov chain analysis with the InVEST model provides elements to estimate changes on carbon storage resulting from landscape changes. It also allows the identification of potential changes in the selected land use classes, providing with technical elements that could help to decision makers to better maintain the ecological integrity of the drainage basin.", "Mapping woody vegetation clearing in Queensland, Australia from Landsat imagery using the Google Earth Engine ": "Monitoring of vegetation clearing in Australia is the province of state governments. Only recently have data and services become available for generalised access to change detection tools suited to this task. The objective of this research was to examine if a globally available cloud computing service, Google Earth Engine Beta, could be used to predict decreases of woody vegetation with accuracies approaching those obtained by the government of the state of Queensland, Australia. This research compared the remote sensing results derived with the Google Earth Engine with those reported by the Queensland Government, using their standard remote sensing methods. Four change detection approaches were investigated using the Landsat-5 TM and 7 ETM+ time-series and algorithms available through the Google Earth Engine Application Programming Interface: (1) Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and (2) Random Forest classifiers; and a normalised time-series of (3) Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and (4) Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) combined with a spectral index, used to predict woody vegetation change between two image composites. The CART and Random Forest classifiers produced the highest user's (78\u201392%) and producer's (55\u201377%) mapping accuracies of clearing compared against the woody vegetation loss maps produced by the Queensland Government when detecting change within epochs for which training data were available. Extrapolation to epochs without training data reduced the mapping accuracies. The normalised FPC and NDVI time-series approaches were more robust for calculating clearing probability, as no training data were required, and can hence be tuned to provide automated alerts for large woody vegetation clearing events by selecting suitable thresholds. This research provides a foundation to build further capacity to use globally accessible, free, online image datasets and processing tools to detect woody vegetation clearing in an automated manner.", "Land use and land cover dynamics and drivers in the Muga watershed, Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia ": "Land use/land cover change causes unprecedented changes on the surrounding environment at different spatial and temporal scales. Muga watershed of Upper Blue Nile basin is characterized by deterioration with mismanagement of natural resources. Thus, this study was aimed at detecting the magnitude and pattern of land use/land cover changes and assessing drivers of changes over the last three decades (1985\u20132017) in the Muga watershed. Synergy of Landsat imageries (1985, 2002, and 2017), household survey, focus group discussion, key informant interview, and field observation were used to detect changes and drivers of changes. Land use/land cover changes in the study watershed were detected using digital image analysis techniques, and their socio-economic and biophysical drivers were analysed using descriptive statistics. The change detection results revealed a significant increasing trend of cultivated land and urban areas by 12 and 270%, respectively. In contrast, grasslands, forest lands and shrub-bushlands showed a declining trend of about 40, 21 and 12%, respectively. The socioeconomic data analysis results indicated that expansion of cultivated land, cutting of trees for fuelwood and construction purposes, population growth, land tenure policy, and climate variability were the most influential drivers of land use/land cover changes in the study watershed. The findings of this study confirmed that unmanaged land cover conversion led to degradation of natural resources of the study watershed. Thus, alternative sources of income for youths and landless peasants, and integrated watershed management, which has paramount importance in maintaining economic and ecological benefits were suggested to alleviate the adverse effects of land use/land cover changes in Muga watershed.", "Timescales of water-quality change in a karst aquifer, south-central Texas ": "Understanding the drivers and timescales over which groundwater quality changes informs groundwater management, use, and protection. To better understand timescales of water-quality change over short (daily to monthly) and long (seasonal to decadal) timescales, the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Enhanced Trends Network (ETN) program instrumented and sampled three wells in the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas. The wells were instrumented to provide high-frequency continuous (subhourly) water-quality data (temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen), which were augmented by the collection of discrete samples (about 6 per year) for a range of geochemical constituents (including selected isotopes and age tracers). ETN data (2013\u20132017) are considered with data from additional sites for the same time period, and also historical records (over more than 80\u202fyears) of climatic and hydrologic conditions. During the four-year study, hydrologic conditions transitioned from very dry to very wet. Sites in the updip/unconfined part of the aquifer showed notable changes in water level and geochemistry (1) in response to rainfall/recharge events, and (2) over the multiyear dry/wet cycle. Sites in the downdip/confined part of the aquifer showed changes in water level/spring discharge over similar timescales, although the response is more muted. Geochemistry at the downdip/confined sites, however, varied slowly and minimally, indicating that the geochemical response of the deeper aquifer is decoupled from recent hydrologic responses. Changes at the updip/unconfined sites reflect mixing with recent recharge, whereas the downdip/confined sites were dominated by mineral-solution reactions resulting from longer (decadal) residence times. Mean groundwater ages interpreted from measured age tracers and lumped parameter models range from 7 to >700\u202fyears (where mixed with premodern downdip water) but were mostly modern. The aquifer is characterized by updip-to-downdip trends in geochemistry with respect to water-rock interaction and groundwater age. Fourier spectral analysis of historical records indicate hydrologic variability has occurred at dominant periods of 30 and 15\u202fyears; in conjunction with age tracers, these results provide insight into timescales at which the aquifer\u2019s public supply is vulnerable to changes in the water quality of recharge.", "State updating of root zone soil moisture estimates of an unsaturated zone metamodel for operational water resources management ": "Combining metamodels with data assimilation schemes allows the incorporation of up-to-date information in metamodels, offering new opportunities for operational water resources management. We developed a data assimilation scheme for the unsaturated zone metamodel MetaSWAP using OpenDA, which is an open source data assimilation framework. A twin experiment showed the feasibility of applying an Ensemble Kalman filter as a data assimilation method for updating metamodels. Furthermore, we assessed the accuracy of root zone soil moisture model estimates when assimilating the regional SMAP L3 Enhanced surface soil moisture product. The model accuracy is assessed using in situ soil moisture measurements collected at 12 locations in the Twente region, the Netherlands. Although the accuracy of the model estimates does not improve in terms of correlation coefficient, the accuracy does improve in terms of Root Mean Square Error and bias. Therefore, the assimilation of surface soil moisture observations has value for updating root zone soil moisture model estimates. In addition, the accuracy of the model estimates improves on both regional and local spatial scales. The increasing availability of remotely sensed soil moisture data will lead to new possibilities for integrating metamodelling and data assimilation in operational water resources management. However, we expect that significant investments in computational capacities are necessary for effective implementation in decision-making.", "A flood inundation forecast of Hurricane Harvey using a continental-scale 2D hydrodynamic model ": "Forecasts of tropical cyclones have seen rapid improvements in recent years as expanding computational capacity permits more runs of finer resolution meteorological models with increasing representation of physical processes. However, the utilization of a hydrodynamic component in these models is often neglected, meaning flood forecasts typically output point water levels that give little indication of a projected inundation extent on the ground. Here, we append this critical component to the forecast cascade by coupling Fathom-US, a continental-scale hydraulic model which employs the LISFLOOD-FP numerical scheme, to forecasts of streamflow, rainfall and coastal surge height from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Medium-term (2\u201315\u202fdays) flood inundation forecasts, as well as hindcasts driven by real-time observations, were executed for Hurricane Harvey by rapidly simulating pluvial and coastal flood hazard and extracting fluvial flood maps from an existing US-wide simulation library. The resultant ~30\u202fm resolution depth grids were then validated against post-event observations collated by the US Geological Survey. Across the disaster zone, the hindcast (forecast) model captured, on average, 78% (75%) of the benchmark flood extent, obtained a Critical Success Index of 0.66 (0.57) and deviated from observed high water marks by ~1\u202fm (~1.2\u202fm). When compared to a simpler GIS-based approach, the hydraulic model exhibited much higher skill in replicating observations. This study shows that fully hydrodynamic approaches can be practicably employed in large-scale forecast frameworks at high resolution to produce skillful projections of inundation extent without significantly affecting the forecast lead time.", "The state of understanding of the lithium-ion-battery graphite solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and its relationship to formation cycling ": "An in-depth historical and current review is presented on the science of lithium-ion battery (LIB) solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on the graphite anode, including structure, morphology, composition, electrochemistry, and formation mechanism. During initial LIB operation, the SEI layer forms on the graphite surfaces, the most common anode material. The SEI is essential to the long-term performance of LIBs, and it also has an impact on its initial capacity loss, self-discharge characteristics, rate capability, and safety. While the presence of the anode SEI is vital, it is difficult to control its formation and growth, as they depend on several factors. These factors include the type of graphite, electrolyte composition, electrochemical conditions, and temperature. Thus, SEI formation and electrochemical stability over long-term operation should be a primary topic of future investigation in the LIB development. This article covers the progression of knowledge regarding the SEI, from its discovery in 1979 to the current state of understanding, and covers differences in the chemical and structural makeup when cell materials and components are varied. It also discusses the relationship of the SEI layer to the LIB formation step, involving both electrolyte wetting and subsequent slow charge\u2013discharge cycles to grow the SEI.", "Synthesis of graphene-based nanosheets via chemical reduction of exfoliated graphite oxide ": "Reduction of a colloidal suspension of exfoliated graphene oxide sheets in water with hydrazine hydrate results in their aggregation and subsequent formation of a high-surface-area carbon material which consists of thin graphene-based sheets. The reduced material was characterized by elemental analysis, thermo-gravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and by electrical conductivity measurements.", "The reduction of graphene oxide ": "Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene. Different reduction processes result in different properties of reduced GO (rGO), which in turn affect the final performance of materials or devices composed of rGO. In this contribution, we review the state-of-art status of the reduction of GO on both techniques and mechanisms. The development in this field will speed the applications of graphene.", "Graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) with comparative discussion to carbon materials ": "Graphitic carbon nitride g-C3N4 was reviewed on its structure, synthesis, texture control, modification and applications, associating with the comparative discussion to carbon materials. Its basic structural unit is a layer of either triazine or heptazine cores consisting of C and N atoms, similar with a layer of hexagonal carbon rings of most of carbon materials. Fundamental synthesis process of g-C3N4 is pyrolysis of its precursors associated with different techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, pressurizing, templating, doping, etc., as those applied for the synthesis of carbon materials. However, the properties of g-C3N4 are quite different from those of carbon materials; the former is hydrophilic but the latter is hydrophobic, and the former is photoactive for visible light but the latter is non-active. Here, g-C3N4 is reviewed on its structure, synthesis, texture control and modification, and application with comparative discussion to carbon materials.", "Blue luminescent graphene quantum dots and graphene oxide prepared by tuning the carbonization degree of citric acid ": "An easy bottom\u2013up method for the preparation of photoluminescent (PL) graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and graphene oxide (GO) has been developed by tuning the carbonization degree of citric acid and dispersing the carbonized products into alkaline solutions. The GQDs are nanosheets \u223c15nm in width, and 0.5\u20132.0nm in thickness. They show a relatively strong (9.0%) PL quantum yield and an excitation-independent PL emission activity. In contrast, the GO nanostructures consist of sheets that are hundreds of nanometers in width and \u223c1nm in height. They exhibit a relatively weak (2.2%) PL quantum yield and an excitation-dependent PL emission activity.", "An improved Hummers method for eco-friendly synthesis of graphene oxide ": "An improved Hummers method without using NaNO3 can produce graphene oxide nearly the same to that prepared by conventional Hummers method. This modification does not decrease the yield of product, eliminating the evolution of NO2/N2O4 toxic gasses and simplifying the disposal of waste water because of the inexistence of Na+ and NO3\n                     \u2212 ions. For the first time, we also developed a prototype method of post-treating the waste water collected from the systems of synthesizing and purifying graphene oxide. The content of Mn2+ ions in the purified waste water was measured to be lower than the guideline value for drinking water.", "Carbon nanotube- and graphene-based nanomaterials and applications in high-voltage supercapacitor: A review ": "The use of carbon nanotube- and graphene-based nanomaterials as a high-performance electrode is one of the promising directions when it comes to developing high-voltage supercapacitors with both a high power density and high energy density. However, the mass production and post-treatment of the carbon nanotube/graphene-based nanomaterials with high purity are necessary steps toward the commercialization of high-performance supercapacitors, and the challenges in engineering carbon nanotube/graphene-based nanomaterials for device-scale supercapacitors also need to be considered. In this review, the authors first introduce the chemical vapor deposition for large-scale preparation of carbon nanotube/graphene-based nanomaterials and the exfoliation method for graphene, which are followed by the methods used to purify these nanomaterials. Then, the capacitance performance of the carbon nanotube/graphene-based nanomaterials in the electrolytes of a high-voltage window is discussed, including the discussion of the capacitance limit of sp2 carbon materials, as well as a comparison of the capacitance performance in ionic liquids electrolytes with that in organic electrolytes and a discussion of low-temperature performance. Finally, the challenges in fabricating supercapacitor devices, such as the intake of excess liquids, the densification of carbon nanotube/graphene-based electrodes, and the reduction of the resistance of supercapacitors, are addressed.", "Hydrazine-reduction of graphite- and graphene oxide ": "We prepared hydrazine-reduced materials from both graphite oxide (GO) particles, which were not exfoliated, and completely exfoliated individual graphene oxide platelets, and then analyzed their chemical and structural properties by elemental analysis, XPS, TGA, XRD, and SEM. Both reduced materials showed distinctly different chemical and structural properties from one another. While hydrazine reduction of graphene oxide platelets produced agglomerates of exfoliated platelets, the reduction of GO particles produced particles that were not exfoliated. The degree of chemical reduction of reduced GO particles was lower than that of reduced graphene oxide and the BET surface area of reduced GO was much lower than that of reduced graphene oxide.", "Nitrogen-doped carbon materials ": "Nitrogen-doped carbon materials are reviewed by focusing on their preparation and applications. Their preparation is described in the order of graphene, carbon nanotube and fibers, porous carbons and carbon blacks, because the investigations working on graphene have taught us many fundamental information on N-doping, though historically graphene has been developed the most recently. On their applications, fuel cells and lithium-sulfur batteries are emphasized because the applications of N-doped carbons in these devices are highly promising.", "Graphene/elastomer nanocomposites ": "In the decade since the first isolation and identification of graphene, the scientific community is still finding ways to utilize its unique properties. The present review deals with the preparation and physicochemical characterization of graphene-based elastomeric nanocomposites. The processing and characterization of graphene and graphene oxide are described in detail, since the presence of such fillers in an elastomeric matrix affects dramatically the properties of the nanocomposite samples. Several preparation routes for the efficient dispersion of graphene in elastomers are then discussed, while aspects such as the interfacial bonding between the filler and the matrix or interactions between the fillers have been thoroughly analysed. Different types of graphene/elastomer nanocomposites are described in terms of their manufacture and properties and it has been shown that depending on the type of graphene employed and the preparation methods, the mechanical, thermal, electrical and barrier properties of the elastomeric matrix can be enhanced due to the presence of graphene, even at relatively-low filler loadings. In most cases, the formation of a filler network can play a major role in the improvement of the overall performance of the material.", "Electromagnetic interference shielding MWCNT-Fe3O4@Ag/epoxy nanocomposites with satisfactory thermal conductivity and high thermal stability ": "Hierarchical composite nanoparticles of multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-Fe3O4@Ag combining electrical conductivity and magnetism were obtained from acyl-amine reaction between carboxylation of Fe3O4@Ag (Fe3O4@Ag-COOH) nanoparticles and amino functionalized MWCNTs (MWCNTs-NH2). Finally, the MWCNT-Fe3O4@Ag/epoxy nanocomposites were fabricated via blending-casting method. When the mass ratio of MWCNTs-NH2 to Fe3O4@Ag-COOH was 9:1 (MF-10), the corresponding epoxy nanocomposites presented an optimal electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE). Furthermore, the MF-10/epoxy nanocomposites with 15\u202fwt% MF-10 presented a satisfying EMI SE of 35\u202fdB and high electrical conductivity of 0.280\u202fS/cm, satisfactory thermal conductivity (thermally conductive coefficient, \u03bb of 0.46\u202fW/mK), outstanding Young's modulus of 4.60\u202fGPa & hardness value of 0.26\u202fGPa and excellent thermal stability (T\n                     \n                        HRI\n                      of 183.4\u202f\u00b0C). The introduction of Fe3O4@Ag nanoparticles not only enhanced the interaction among MF-10, so as to promote the formation of conductive networks, leading to higher \u03bb and EMI SE value, but also contributed to hysteresis loss of electromagnetic waves, and offered more interfaces to reflect and reabsorb electromagnetic waves, resulting in highly improved attenuation of electromagnetic waves.", "Carbon materials for the electrochemical storage of energy in capacitors ": "The electrochemical storage of energy in various carbon materials (activated carbons, aerogels, xerogels, nanostructures) used as capacitor electrodes is considered. Different types of capacitors with a pure electrostatic attraction and/or pseudocapacitance effects are presented. Their performance in various electrolytes is studied taking into account the different range of operating voltage (1 V for aqueous and 3 V for aprotic solutions). Trials are undertaken for estimating the role of micro and mesopores during charging the electrical double layer in both kinds of electrolytic solutions for which the electrical conductivity and the size of solvated ions are different. The effect of pseudocapacitance for maximising the total capacitance is especially documented. Carbons chemically modified by a strong oxidation treatment represent a very well defined region of pseudocapacitance properties due to the Faradaic redox reactions of their rich surface functionality. Conducting polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene derivatives) and oxidised metallic particles (Ru, Mn, Co,\u2026) deposited on the carbons also participate in the enhancement of the final capacity through fast faradaic pseudocapacitance effects. Evaluation of capacitor performance by different techniques, e.g. voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, charge/discharge characteristics is also discussed.", "The chemical and structural analysis of graphene oxide with different degrees of oxidation ": "Graphene oxide (GO) with various degrees of oxidation was synthesized using a modified Hummers method. The formation of different types of oxygen containing functional groups in GO, and their influences on its structure were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), zeta potential analysis and Raman spectroscopy. XRD studies showed a disruption of the graphitic AB stacking order during the increase in oxidation levels. XPS analysis revealed the formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at lower oxidation levels and epoxide groups at higher oxidation levels. The influence of the oxidation degree on the properties of GO was evaluated by zeta potential analysis, which showed a linear increase in the zeta potential with increasing oxidation levels. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed that increasing oxidation levels results in a transition from a crystalline to an amorphous structure. The electrochemical properties of GO is highly influenced by the variation in degree of oxidation. Our results suggest that the properties of GO can be tuned by varying the oxidation degree, which may pave the way to new developments in the GO-based applications.", "Carbon-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction: A review on degradation mechanisms ": "This review focuses on the historic and recent progress of the stability of the carbon-based non-platinum-group metal (PGM) and metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It highlights the reported degradation mechanisms which are responsible for the instability issue. These mechanisms are (a) oxidative attack of the ORR intermediates, (b) demetalation of the metal-active site, (c) protonation followed by anionic adsorption, and (d) micropore flooding. For the metal-based catalysts, mechanisms (a) and (b) are the most commonly observed. From the review, it is known that the oxidative attack of ORR intermediates leads to the carbon oxidation, which can also result in the demetalation of the metal-active site. Additionally, the demetalation of the iron-based catalysts can also indirectly oxidize the carbon-support via Fenton reaction. The mechanisms (c) and (d) are sharply criticized. Finally, for the metal-free carbon-based catalysts, there is only a limited research available on the stability of these catalysts. Among the reported study, the mechanisms (a) and (c) can be responsible for the degradation of these catalysts. Therefore, it is recommended that more study should be focused on investigating the degradation parameters and mechanisms for metal-free catalysts.", "X-ray diffraction patterns of graphite and turbostratic carbon ": "To identify the influence of microstructural variation on the X-ray diffraction intensities, X-ray diffraction patterns of hexagonal graphite (h-graphite) and turbostratic carbon (t-carbon) were simulated by using the general Debye equation. The numeric density of interatomic distance (NDID) is sensitive to the size and microstructure of a crystallite, so that it is used to characterize the structures of h-graphite and t-carbon. The dependence of the diffraction angles and full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of diffraction lines on the crystallite size and distortion factors is examined by computer simulation. The distortion factors for t-carbon, including rotation, translation, curvature, local positive fluctuation of interlayer spacing of graphene layers and fluctuation of atomic positions, have different influence on the NDIDs, hence on the X-ray diffraction patterns. The simulation results indicate that the diffraction angles and FWHMs of diffraction lines cannot be simply used to characterize the lattice parameters and crystallite sizes of t-carbon.", "Direct reduction of graphene oxide films into highly conductive and flexible graphene films by hydrohalic acids ": "We report a simple but highly-effective hydrohalic acid reducing method to reduce graphene oxide (GO) films into highly conductive graphene films without destroying their integrity and flexibility at low temperature based on the nucleophilic substitution reaction. GO films reduced for 1h at 100\u00b0C in 55% hydroiodic (HI) acid have an electrical conductivity as high as 298S/cm and a C/O ratio above 12, both of which are much higher than films reduced by other chemical methods. The reduction maintains good integrity and flexibility, and even improves the strength and ductility, of the original GO films. Based on this reducing method, a flexible graphene-based transparent conductive film with a sheet resistance of 1.6k\u03a9/sq and 85% transparency was obtained, further verifying the advantage of HI acid reduction.", "Carbon materials and their composites for electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness in X-band ": "Owing to intensive advancement in telecommunications and electronics devices, electromagnetic pollution has become a serious concern for civic life, and their interference can cause failure of the other electronic devices and systems. Therefore, the lightweight electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials are of vital importance for controlling the electromagnetic pollution and protecting the human as well as the other nearby devices or systems. In this regard, carbon materials and their composites have been proved to be the best due to their unique properties such as advanced electrical conductivities, high surface area, light weight, environmental friendliness, excellent flexibility, low density, chemical stability and excellent mechanical properties. Various carbon forms such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon fiber, carbon aerogels, carbon black, activated carbon and carbon nanoparticles, as well as their hybrid composites have been extensively developed for microwave absorption and shielding. The microstructures of the carbon nanomaterials and their configurations, various structures of the shield and inclusion of the magnetic and dielectric materials in the shield have been found to be significantly beneficial for high EMI shielding effectiveness. In this paper, the synthesis and EMI shielding performances of these carbon based materials in X-band (8.2\u201312.4\u202fGHz) have been reviewed and their shielding mechanisms are discussed.", "Hard carbon spheres interconnected by carbon nanotubes as high-performance anodes for sodium-ion batteries ": "Hard carbon is one of the most promising candidates of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its insufficient electrical conductivity resulted from the non-graphitizable structure is a main obstacle to increasing its capacity and rate performance in devices. To resolve this issue, here carbon nanotubes (CNTs) connected hard carbon spheres (HCSs) composite was prepared by carbonizing CNTs supported 3-aminophenol-formaldehyde resin spheres. The seamless bonding of CNTs onto HCSs provide a long-range conductive path for electron transport and the porous skeleton allowing convenient ion diffusion. The as-prepared HCSs-CNTs composite shows a reversible capacity of 151.7\u202fmAh g\u22121 after 160 cycles when used as anode materials for SIBs. It also exhibits outstanding long-life cycling performance and rate capability, achieving a capacity of 95.1\u202fmAh g\u22121 at 1000\u202fmA\u202fg\u22121 after 500 cycles and 71.7\u202fmAh g\u22121 at 3000\u202fmA\u202fg\u22121. In particular, it is worth noticing that the capacitive behavior of HCSs-CNTs electrode makes a major contribution to the enhanced rate capability.", "Overview of carbon nanostructures and nanocomposites for electromagnetic wave shielding ": "Based on the contributions of carbon nanostructures and their composited species, great advances in electromagnetic wave interference shielding have been achieved. In this article, recent progress in electromagnetic wave shielding enabled by the synergism of carbon nanostructures and their corresponding composites is discussed encompassing the factors of microstructural defects, filler concentration, filler alignment, filler inherent conductivity and the surrounding temperature. Carbon nanostructures and their composites would energize the advanced electromagnetic wave shielding because of their light weight, high corrosion resistance, excellent thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, broad absorption frequency bandwidth and cost-effectiveness. In this context of identifying suitable carbon composites that can enhance electromagnetic wave absorption. This review provides updated electromagnetic wave shielding knowledge of carbon nanostructures and their composites as well as their prospects and challenges.", "Raman microspectroscopy of soot and related carbonaceous materials: Spectral analysis and structural information ": "Experimental conditions and mathematical fitting procedures for the collection and analysis of Raman spectra of soot and related carbonaceous materials have been investigated and optimised with a Raman microscope system operated at three different laser excitation wavelengths (514, 633, and 780nm). Several band combinations for spectral analysis have been tested, and a combination of four Lorentzian-shaped bands (G, D1, D2, D4) at about 1580, 1350, 1620, and 1200cm\u22121, respectively, with a Gaussian-shaped band (D3) at \u223c1500cm\u22121 was best suited for the first-order spectra. The second-order spectra were best fitted with Lorentzian-shaped bands at about 2450, 2700, 2900, and 3100cm\u22121. Spectral parameters (band positions, full widths at half maximum, and intensity ratios) are reported for several types of industrial carbon black (Degussa Printex, Cabot Monarch), diesel soot (particulate matter from modern heavy duty vehicle and passenger car engine exhaust, NIST SRM1650), spark-discharge soot (Palas GfG100), and graphite. Several parameters, in particular the width of the D1 band at \u223c1350cm\u22121, provide structural information and allow to discriminate the sample materials, but the characterisation and distinction of different types of soot is limited by the experimental reproducibility of the spectra and the statistical uncertainties of curve fitting. The results are discussed and compared with X-ray diffraction measurements and earlier Raman spectroscopic studies of comparable materials, where different measurement and fitting procedures had been applied.", "Influence of interface dipole layers on the performance of graphene field effect transistors ": "The linear band dispersion of graphene's bands near the Fermi level gives rise to its unique electronic properties, such as a giant carrier mobility, and this has triggered extensive research in applications, such as graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs). However, GFETs generally exhibit a device performance much inferior compared to the expected one. This has been attributed to a strong dependence of the electronic properties of graphene on the surrounding interfaces. Here we study the interface between a graphene channel and SiO2, and by means of photoelectron spectromicroscopy achieve a detailed determination of the course of band alignment at the interface. Our results show that the electronic properties of graphene are modulated by a hydrophilic SiO2 surface, but not by a hydrophobic one. By combining photoelectron spectromicroscopy with GFET transport property characterization, we demonstrate that the presence of electrical dipoles in the interface, which reflects the SiO2 surface electrochemistry, determines the GFET device performance. A hysteresis in the resistance vs. gate voltage as a function of polarity is ascribed to a reversal of the dipole layer by the gate voltage. These data pave the way for GFET device optimization.", "Chemical oxidation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes ": "The effect of oxidation on the structural integrity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes through acidic (nitric acid and a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide) and basic (ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide) agents has been studied. In order to purify the as-received material, a non-oxidative treatment (with hydrochloric acid) was also applied. Electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis clearly revealed that the nitric acid-treated material under reflux conditions suffered the highest degree of degradation, such as, nanotube shortening and additional defect generation in the graphitic network. Basic oxidative treatment led to the complete removal of amorphous carbon and metal oxide impurities but the structural integrity was found to be intact. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to confirm the different functionalities produced for each oxidation agent, whereas titration measurements determined the relative concentration of carboxylic functions onto the graphitic surface. Moreover, a general relationship between the chemical treatment and the amount of non-graphitic carbon was established by means of Raman spectroscopy measurements. The possibility of controlling the required amount of functionality, carboxylic and hydroxyl, via these oxidation procedures is discussed.", "Graphitic carbon nitride (g\u2013C3N4)\u2013based metal-free photocatalysts for water splitting: A review ": "A variety of g\u2013C3N4\u2013based metal-free photocatalysts for H2 generation including structurally manipulated g-C3N4, g\u2013C3N4\u2013doped with non-metallic elements and molecules, hetero-junctions of g-C3N4 with carbonaceous materials, polymers as well as SiC and g\u2013C3N4\u2013based iso-type or homo-junctions are considered. Innumerable strategies have been attempted to enhance H2 evolution rate of g\u2013C3N4\u2013derived metal-free photocatalysts compared to pure g-C3N4. Furthermore, challenges in this area are yet to be tackled to resolve the issues low efficiency, low stability and dependence on noble metal co-catalysts for increasing the product yield and reduction in redox capability by narrowing the band gap. This review attempts to cover the latest developments, especially in the area of graphitic carbon nitride (g\u2013C3N4)\u2013based metal-free photocatalysts for H2 generation.", "Biomass derived porous carbon for CO2 capture ": "The quest for producing cost-effective and efficient adsorbents for CO2 capture has received enormous attention in recent times. Biomass-derived porous carbons are considered to be the most preferred adsorbent materials for CO2 capture owing to their excellent textural properties, tunable porosity and low cost. Different type of activation processes including solid-state activation possess generate appropriate morphology and other physico-chemical properties in these materials which enable them to act as effective adsorbents for CO2 capture. In this review, the key scientific results from published literature have been consolidated and critical commentary has been provided to give a broad insight into the production of biochar and activated porous carbons and their application in CO2 capture. A thorough review of the mechanism of pyrolysis for cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin has been presented in detail. The ability of different activating agents to produce activated porous carbons has been discussed. A summary of the application of biochar and activated porous carbons for CO2 capture has been included. The review concludes with an overview of future outlook and potential research direction that could be undertaken for advancing the utilization of biomass-derived porous carbon materials for applications including CO2 capture and energy storage.", "\n               Toxoplasma gondii infection in Amami spiny rat on Amami-Oshima Island, Japan ": "The Amami spiny rat (Tokudaia osimensis) is an endangered rodent species that is endemic to the forests of Amami-Oshima Island, Kagoshima, Japan. In July 2018, a deceased adult male Amami spiny rat was found on the Yuwandake Mountain Trail on the south-central coast of Amami-Oshima Island. Histopathological observations revealed protozoan infections in the liver, lungs, and heart. Nested or semi-nested PCRs targeting the B1, SAG3, GRA6, and ROP18 genes successfully detected the genomic DNA of Toxoplasma gondii in the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimen. Sequence analyses of the SAG3, GRA6, and ROP18 genes suggested that the strain detected in the study specimen was related to the type II strain of T. gondii. This is the first confirmed case of T. gondii infection in an Amami spiny rat.", "Parasites and wildlife in a changing world: The vector-host- pathogen interaction as a learning case ": "In the Anthropocene context, changes in climate, land use and biodiversity are considered among the most important anthropogenic factors affecting parasites-host interaction and wildlife zoonotic diseases emergence. Transmission of vector borne pathogens are particularly sensitive to these changes due to the complexity of their cycle, where the transmission of a microparasite depends on the interaction between its vector, usually a macroparasite, and its reservoir host, in many cases represented by a wildlife vertebrate. The scope of this paper focuses on the effect of some major, fast-occurring anthropogenic changes on the vectorial capacity for tick and mosquito borne pathogens. Specifically, we review and present the latest advances regarding two emerging vector-borne viruses in Europe: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and West Nile virus (WNV). In both cases, variation in vector to host ratio is critical in determining the intensity of pathogen transmission and consequently infection hazard for humans. Forecasting vector-borne disease hazard under the global change scenarios is particularly challenging, requiring long term studies based on a multidisciplinary approach in a One-Health framework.", "A review of sarcoptic mange in North American wildlife ": "The \u201citch mite\u201d or \u201cmange mite\u201d, Sarcoptes scabiei, causes scabies in humans and sarcoptic mange in domestic and free-ranging animals. This mite has a wide host range due to its ability to adapt to new hosts and has been spread across the globe presumably through human expansion. While disease caused by S. scabiei has been very well-studied in humans and domestic animals, there are still numerous gaps in our understanding of this pathogen in free-ranging wildlife. The literature on sarcoptic mange in North American wildlife is particularly limited, which may be due to the relatively limited number of clinically-affected species and lack of severe population impacts seen in other continents. This review article provides a summary of the current knowledge of mange in wildlife, with a focus on the most common clinically-affected species in North America including red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), gray wolves (Canis lupus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and American black bears (Ursus americanus).", "Are molecular tools clarifying or confusing our understanding of the public health threat from zoonotic enteric protozoa in wildlife? ": "Emerging infectious diseases are frequently zoonotic, often originating in wildlife, but enteric protozoa are considered relatively minor contributors. Opinions regarding whether pathogenic enteric protozoa may be transmitted between wildlife and humans have been shaped by our investigation tools, and have led to oscillations regarding whether particular species are zoonotic or have host-adapted life cycles.\n                  When the only approach for identifying enteric protozoa was morphology, it was assumed that many enteric protozoa colonized multiple hosts and were probably zoonotic. When molecular tools revealed genetic differences in morphologically identical species colonizing humans and other animals, host specificity seemed more likely. Parasites from animals found to be genetically identical - at the few genes investigated - to morphologically indistinguishable parasites from human hosts, were described as having zoonotic potential. More discriminatory molecular tools have now sub-divided some protozoa again. Meanwhile, some infection events indicate that, circumstances permitting, some \u201chost-specific\u201d protozoa, can actually infect various hosts. These repeated changes in our understanding are linked intrinsically to the investigative tools available.\n                  Here we review how molecular tools have assisted, or sometimes confused, our understanding of the public health threat from nine enteric protozoa and example wildlife hosts (Balantoides coli - wild boar; Blastocystis sp. - wild rodents; Cryptosporidium spp. - wild fish; Encephalitozoon spp. - wild birds; Entamoeba spp. - non-human primates; Enterocytozoon bieneusi - wild cervids; Giardia duodenalis - red foxes; Sarcocystis nesbitti - snakes; Toxoplasma gondii - bobcats).\n                  Molecular tools have provided evidence that some enteric protozoa in wildlife may infect humans, but due to limited discriminatory power, often only the zoonotic potential of the parasite is indicated. Molecular analyses, which should be as discriminatory as possible, are one, but not the only, component of the toolbox for investigating potential public health impacts from pathogenic enteric protozoa in wildlife.", "\n               Anisakis Nematodes in Fish and Shellfish- from infection to allergies ": "Anisakidosis is a zoonotic parasitosis induced by members of the family Anisakidae. The anisakid genera includes Anisakis, Pseudoterranova, Hysterothylacium and Contracaecum. The final definitive hosts of these nematodes are marine mammals with a complex life cycle. These nematode parasites use different crustaceans and fish species as intermediate or paratenic hosts and humans are accidental hosts. Human anisakiasis, the infections caused by members of the genus Anisakis, occurs, when seafoods, particularly fish, contaminated with the infective stage (third stage larvae [L3]) of this parasite, are consumed. Pseudoterranovosis, on the other hand is induced by members of the genus Pseudoterranova. These two genera of anisakids have been implicated in human disease globally. There is a rise in reports of gastro-intestinal infections accompanied by allergic reactions caused by Anisakis simplex and Anisakis pegreffii. This review provides an update on current knowledge on Anisakis as a food-borne parasite with special focus on the increasingly reported diversity of fish and crustacean hosts, allergens and immunological cross-reactivity with invertebrate proteins rendering this parasite a significant public health issue.", "Climate change, biodiversity, ticks and tick-borne diseases: The butterfly effect ": "We have killed wild animals for obtaining food and decimated forests for many reasons. Nowadays, we are burning fossil fuels as never before and even exploring petroleum in deep waters. The impact of these activities on our planet is now visible to the naked eye and the debate on climate change is warming up in scientific meetings and becoming a priority on the agenda of both scientists and policy decision makers. On the occasion of the Impact of Environmental Changes on Infectious Diseases (IECID) meeting, held in the 2015 in Sitges, Spain, I was invited to give a keynote talk on climate change, biodiversity, ticks and tick-borne diseases. The aim of the present article is to logically extend my rationale presented on the occasion of the IECID meeting. This article is not intended to be an exhaustive review, but an essay on climate change, biodiversity, ticks and tick-borne diseases. It may be anticipated that warmer winters and extended autumn and spring seasons will continue to drive the expansion of the distribution of some tick species (e.g., Ixodes ricinus) to northern latitudes and to higher altitudes. Nonetheless, further studies are advocated to improve our understanding of the complex interactions between landscape, climate, host communities (biodiversity), tick demography, pathogen diversity, human demography, human behaviour, economics, and politics, also considering all ecological processes (e.g., trophic cascades) and other possible interacting effects (e.g., mutual effects of increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased deforestation rates). The multitude of variables and interacting factors involved, and their complexity and dynamism, make tick-borne transmission systems beyond (current) human comprehension. That is, perhaps, the main reason for our inability to precisely predict new epidemics of vector-borne diseases in general.", "Zoonotic nematodes of wild carnivores ": "For a long time, wildlife carnivores have been disregarded for their potential in transmitting zoonotic nematodes. However, human activities and politics (e.g., fragmentation of the environment, land use, recycling in urban settings) have consistently favoured the encroachment of urban areas upon wild environments, ultimately causing alteration of many ecosystems with changes in the composition of the wild fauna and destruction of boundaries between domestic and wild environments. Therefore, the exchange of parasites from wild to domestic carnivores and vice versa have enhanced the public health relevance of wild carnivores and their potential impact in the epidemiology of many zoonotic parasitic diseases. The risk of transmission of zoonotic nematodes from wild carnivores to humans via food, water and soil (e.g., genera Ancylostoma, Baylisascaris, Capillaria, Uncinaria, Strongyloides, Toxocara, Trichinella) or arthropod vectors (e.g., genera Dirofilaria spp., Onchocerca spp., Thelazia spp.) and the emergence, re-emergence or the decreasing trend of selected infections is herein discussed. In addition, the reasons for limited scientific information about some parasites of zoonotic concern have been examined. A correct compromise between conservation of wild carnivores and risk of introduction and spreading of parasites of public health concern is discussed in order to adequately manage the risk of zoonotic nematodes of wild carnivores in line with the \u2018One Health\u2019 approach.", "Molecular prevalence and phylogenetic relationship of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium parasites of owls in Thailand: Data from a rehabilitation centre ": "Owls are nocturnal raptors that are prevalently infected with haemosporidian parasites wordwide. These birds were commonly submitted to the Kasetsart University Raptor Rehabilitation Unit, Kasetsart University, Thailand and were examined using PCR-based methods for the presence of haemosporidian infections of by the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus. Blood samples from 167 individual owls belonging to 12 species common in Thailand were collected between September 2012 and February 2018. The overall prevalence of haemosporidians was 34.1%, with Haemoproteus infections (25.1%) being more prevalent than Plasmodium infections (9.0%). The prevalence of both Haemoproteus and Plasmodium parasites was similar in all seasons of the year. Molecular characterization revealed 17 new haemosporidian parasite lineages (11 Haemoproteus and six Plasmodium), with genetic variation among partial cytochrome b sequences ranging from 0.0% to 3.6% in Haemoproteus lineages and 0.2%\u20138.8% in Plasmodium lineages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all Haemoproteus lineages detected in owls appeared in one well-supported clade together with other parasites belonging to the Parahaemoproteus subgenus, indicating their close evolutionary relationship and common transmission modality by Culicoides biting midges. This study showes the existence of prominent non-described haemosporidian parasite diversity in Thai owls and provides baseline molecular information for further research on the genetic diversity of owl haemosporidian parasites. New DNA sequence information can be used for the diagnosis of owl infections, which have been often reported during rehabilitation planning.", "Broad tapeworms (Diphyllobothriidae), parasites of wildlife and humans: Recent progress and future challenges ": "Tapeworms of the family Diphyllobothriidae, commonly known as broad tapeworms, are predominantly large-bodied parasites of wildlife capable of infecting humans as their natural or accidental host. Diphyllobothriosis caused by adults of the genera Dibothriocephalus, Adenocephalus and Diphyllobothrium is usually not a life-threatening disease. Sparganosis, in contrast, is caused by larvae (plerocercoids) of species of Spirometra and can have serious health consequences, exceptionally leading to host's death in the case of generalised sparganosis caused by \u2018Sparganum proliferum\u2019. While most of the definitive wildlife hosts of broad tapeworms are recruited from marine and terrestrial mammal taxa (mainly carnivores and cetaceans), only a few diphyllobothriideans mature in fish-eating birds. In this review, we provide an overview the recent progress in our understanding of the diversity, phylogenetic relationships and distribution of broad tapeworms achieved over the last decade and outline the prospects of future research. The multigene family-wide phylogeny of the order published in 2017 allowed to propose an updated classification of the group, including new generic assignment of the most important causative agents of human diphyllobothriosis, i.e., Dibothriocephalus latus and D. nihonkaiensis. Genomic data of selected representatives have also begun to accumulate, promising future developments in understanding the biology of this particular group of parasites. The list of nominal species of taxonomically most complicated genus Spirometra as well as host-parasite list of 37 species of broad tapeworms parasitising marine mammals (pinnipeds and cetaceans) are also provided.", "Wildlife-transmitted Taenia and Versteria cysticercosis and coenurosis in humans and other primates ": "Wild mustelids and canids are definitive hosts of Taenia and Versteria spp. while rodents act as natural intermediate hosts. Rarely, larval stages of these parasites can cause serious zoonoses. In Europe, four cases of Taenia martis cysticercosis have been diagnosed in immunocompetent women, and two cases in zoo primates since 2013. In North America, a zoonotic genotype related but distinct from Versteria mustelae has been identified in 2014, which had caused a fatal infection in an orangutan and liver- and disseminated cysticercoses in two severely immune deficient human patients in 2018, respectively. Additionally, we could attribute a historic human case from the USA to this Versteria sp. by reanalysing a published nucleotide sequence. In the last decades, sporadic zoonotic infections by cysticerci of the canid tapeworm Taenia crassiceps have been described (4 in North America, 8 in Europe). Besides, 3 ocular cases from North America and one neural infection from Europe, all in immunocompetent patients, 6 cutaneous infections were described in severely immunocompromised European patients. Correspondingly, besides oral infections with taeniid eggs, accidental subcutaneous oncosphere establishment after egg-contamination of open wounds was suggested, especially in cases with a history of cutaneous injuries at the infection site. Taenia multiceps is mainly transmitted in a domestic cycle. Only five human coenurosis cases are published since 2000. In contrast, T. serialis coenurosis (1 human case since 2000) is primarily transmitted by wild canids. The etiological diagnosis of exotic cysticercoses is challenging. Usually, clinical material does not allow for a morphological identification, and serological tests are not available. These limitations have partly been overcome by molecular tools. Without claiming any dramatic emergence of cysticercoses and coenuroses transmitted by wild carnivores, further sporadic cases of such \u2018exotic\u2019 infections have to be expected.", "Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of Trypanosoma spp. detected from striped leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros vittatus) in Zambia ": "Bat trypanosomes consist of more than 30 trypanosome species from over 70 species of bats. Recent studies suggest that bats play a role in disseminating trypanosomes from African continent to the terrestrial mammals both in the Afrotropic-Palearctic Ecozones and Nearctic Ecozone. However, the diversity, distribution, and evolution of bat trypanosomes are still unclear. To better understand their evolution, more genetic data of bat trypanosomes from a variety of locations are required. During a survey of Borrelia spp. of bats inhabiting a cave in Zambia, we observed flagellate parasites from 5 of 43 hemocultures. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gGAPDH; 572 bp) and the 18S ribosomal RNA gene (18S rRNA gene; 1,079\u20131,091 bp) revealed that all were Trypanosoma spp. belonged to the Trypanosoma cruzi clade. Three and two of them exhibited the similarity with T. conorhini and T. dionisii, respectively. The present study provides the first genetic data on Trypanosoma spp. of bats inhabiting Zambia.", "Cystic echinococcosis in wild boars (Sus scrofa) from southern Italy: Epidemiological survey and molecular characterization ": "Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.) is one of the most important parasitic zoonotic diseases in the world and it represents an important public health and socio-economic concern. In the Mediterranean basin, CE is widespread and it is endemic in Italy, with major prevalence in southern areas. Several studies have investigated CE in domestic pigs, however, such data in wild boars are scant. In the last decades the wild boar population in Italy has increased and this ungulate could play an important role in the spreading of CE in the wild. Here we report on the prevalence and fertility rate of hydatid cysts in wild boars that were shot during two hunting seasons (2016\u20132017) in the Campania region of southern Italy.\n                  For each animal, a detailed inspection of the carcass and organs (lungs, liver and spleen) was performed and when cysts were found, their number, morphology and fertility were determined by visual and microscopic examination. Cysts were classified morphologically as fertile, sterile, caseous and calcified. Protoscoleces and germinal layers were collected from individual cysts and DNA was extracted to identify different strains/genotypes of E. granulosus s.l.\n                  Out of a total of 2108 wild boars 93 (4.4%) were found positive for CE. Infected animals were 45 males and 48 females, aged between 1 and 8 years. The average number of cysts per wild boar was 1.3 (min 1 - max 13). The total number of cysts collected was 123, of which 118 (95.9%) in the liver, 4 (3.3%) in the lungs and 1 (0.8%) in the spleen. Of all analyzed cysts, 70 (56.9%) were fertile and 53 (43.1%) sterile/acephalous. The presence of fertile cysts in 19.4% of CE-positive animals is noteworthy. Overall, molecular diagnosis showed 19 wild boars infected with the pig strain (G7).", "Prevalence, distribution, and diversity of cryptic piroplasm infections in raccoons from selected areas of the United States and Canada ": "The order Piroplasmida contains a diverse group of intracellular parasites, many of which can cause significant disease in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Two piroplasm species have been reported from raccoons (Procyon lotor), Babesia lotori (Babesia sensu stricto clade) and a species related to Babesia microti (called B. microti-like sp.). The goal of this study was to investigate prevalence, distribution, and diversity of Babesia in raccoons. We tested raccoons from selected regions in the United States and Canada for the presence of Babesia sensu stricto and Babesia microti-like sp. piroplasms. Infections of Babesia microti-like sp. were found in nearly all locations sampled, often with high prevalence, while Babesia sensu stricto infections had higher prevalence in the Southeastern United States (20\u201345% prevalence). Co-infections with both Babesia sp. were common. Sequencing of the partial 18S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) genes led to the discovery of two new Babesia species, both found in several locations in the eastern and western United States. One novel Babesia sensu stricto sp. was most similar to Babesia gibsoni while the other Babesia species was present in the \u2018western piroplasm\u2019 group and was related to Babesia conradae. Phylogenetic analysis of the cox1 sequences indicated possible eastern and western genetic variants for the three Babesia sensu stricto species. Additional analyses are needed to characterize these novel species; however, this study indicates there are now at least four species of piroplasms infecting raccoons in the United States and Canada (Babesia microti-like sp., Babesia lotori, a novel Babesia sensu stricto sp., a novel western Babesia sp.) and a possible fifth species (Babesia sensu stricto) in raccoons in Japan.", "Do managed bees drive parasite spread and emergence in wild bees? ": "Bees have been managed and utilised for honey production for centuries and, more recently, pollination services. Since the mid 20th Century, the use and production of managed bees has intensified with hundreds of thousands of hives being moved across countries and around the globe on an annual basis. However, the introduction of unnaturally high densities of bees to areas could have adverse effects. Importation and deployment of managed honey bee and bumblebees may be responsible for parasite introductions or a change in the dynamics of native parasites that ultimately increases disease prevalence in wild bees. Here we review the domestication and deployment of managed bees and explain the evidence for the role of managed bees in causing adverse effects on the health of wild bees. Correlations with the use of managed bees and decreases in wild bee health from territories across the globe are discussed along with suggestions to mitigate further health reductions in wild bees.", "Pathobiology and first report of larval nematodes (Ascaridomorpha sp.) infecting freshwater mussels (Villosa nebulosa, Unionidae), including an inventory of nematode infections in freshwater and marine bivalves ": "Little information is available on host-parasite relationships between bivalves and larval nematodes. Herein, we describe nematode larvae (likely stage 2) in the infraorder Ascaridomorpha infecting the foot, intestine, and mantle of a freshwater mussel (Alabama rainbow, Villosa nebulosa [Conrad, 1834]) and detail histopathological changes to infected tissues. A total of 43 live mussels from the South Fork of Terrapin Creek, Alabama, were collected between 2010 and 2014, with 14 sectioned for histopathology and 29 dissected. Of the 14 sectioned mussels, 5 appeared to be uninfected, and 7, 1, and 1 had histozoic infections observed in the foot and intestine, intestine only, and mantle edge and foot, respectively. Twenty-three of 29 (79%) of the mussels dissected were infected by live nematodes, and mean nematode abundance was 8.3 (CL\u202f=\u202f5.23\u201313), with 2 mussels infected with >100 nematodes each. Thus, with a total of 32 of the 43 collected mussels observed with nematodes, overall infection prevalence was 74.4% (CL\u202f=\u202f0.594\u20130.855). The 18S rDNA of this nematode was 99% similar to that of several ascaridids (species of Kathlaniidae Lane, 1914 and Quimperiidae Baylis, 1930) that mature in aquatic/semi-aquatic vertebrates; the recovered 18S phylogenetic tree indicated this nematode from V.\u00a0nebulosa shares a recent common ancestor with Ichthyobronema hamulatum (Ascaridomorpha: Quimperiidae; GenBank Accession Number KY476351). Pathological changes to tissue associated with these infections comprised focal tissue damage, but a cellular response was not evident. The Alabama rainbow possibly represents an intermediate or paratenic host. Given these results, the nematode is likely not pathogenic under normal stream conditions; however, high intensity infections in the foot could inhibit pedal extension and retraction; which would have demonstrable health consequences to a freshwater mussel. Based on our review of the bivalve mollusc parasite literature, a collective biodiversity of 61 nematodes reportedly exhibit some degree of symbiosis (from commensal to parasitic) with 21 bivalves (28 nematode spp. from 17 marine bivalve spp.; 33 nematode spp. from 4 freshwater bivalve spp.); only four records exist of putatively parasitic nematodes from Unionida. The present study represents the first description of a nematode species that invades the tissues of a Unionidae species.", "\n               Trichinella pseudospiralis in a wolverine (Gulo gulo) from the Canadian North ": "Species of Trichinella are a globally distributed assemblage of nematodes, often with distinct host ranges, which include people, domestic, and wild animals. Trichinella spp. are important in northern Canada, where dietary habits of people and methods of meat preparation (drying, smoking, fermenting as well as raw) increase the risk posed by these foodborne zoonotic parasites. Outbreaks in the arctic and subarctic regions of Canada and the United States are generally attributed to T. nativa (T2) or the T6 genotype, when genetic characterization is performed. We report the discovery of Trichinella pseudospiralis (T4), a non-encapsulated species, in a wolverine (Gulo gulo) from the Northwest Territories of Canada. This parasite has been previously reported elsewhere from both mammals and carnivorous birds, but our findings represent new host and geographic records for T. pseudospiralis. Multiplex PCR and sequencing of fragments of Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit I (COI) and D3 rDNA confirmed the identification. Phylogenetically, Canadian isolates linked with each other and others derived from Palearctic or Neotropical regions, but not elsewhere in the Nearctic (continental USA). We suggest that migratory birds might have played a role in the dispersal of this pathogen 1000's of km to northwestern Canada. Wolverines are not typically consumed by humans, and thus should not pose a direct food safety risk for trichinellosis. However, the current finding suggests that they may serve as an indicator of a broader distribution for T. pseudospiralis. Along with infection risk already recognized for T. nativa and Trichinella T6, our observations emphasize the need for further studies using molecular diagnostics and alternative methods to clarify if this is a solitary case, or if T. pseudospiralis and other freeze susceptible species of Trichinella (such as T. spiralis) circulate more broadly in wildlife in Canada, and elsewhere.", "Comparative microbiomes of ticks collected from a black rhino and its surrounding environment ": "\u2018Eliska,\u2019 an endangered black rhino (Diceros bicornis), died suddenly in Mkomazi National Park in Tanzania in 2016. Three Amblyomma gemma ticks were collected from Eliska's body, and four ticks were collected from the surrounding field. We conducted 16S rRNA targeted high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the overall composition of bacteria in the ticks' microbiomes and investigate whether the ticks could be the cause of Eliska's death. The ticks collected from Eliska's body and the field were found to differ in their bacterial composition. Bacillus chungangensis and B. pumilus were the most commonly found bacteria in the ticks collected from the field, and B. cereus and Lysinibacillus sphaericus were the most commonly found in the ticks collected from Eliska's body. The abundance was higher in the ticks collected from the field. In contrast, the equity was higher in the ticks collected from Eliska's body. No known pathogenic bacteria that could explain Eliska's sudden death were found in any of the ticks. The differences between the microbiome of ticks collected from Eliska's body and from the field indicate that the microbiome of ticks' changes through the consumption of blood.", "First record of a \u2018fish\u2019 blood fluke (Digenea: Aporocotylidae) from a marine mammal: Cardicola dhangali n. sp. ": "We describe the first known blood fluke from a marine mammal, the dugong, Dugong dugon (Sirenia: Dugongidae), which represents a new species of aporocotylid, Cardicola dhangali n. sp. (Digenea: Aporocotylidae). Eggs presumed to be of blood flukes have been previously reported from dugongs. This exciting discovery raises questions regarding evolution and host-switching in the Aporocotylidae, which prior to this study were only known to infect actinopterygian and chondrichthyan fishes. The new species has male and female genital pores opening on the right side of the body, with the male genital pore opening posterior to the entire reproductive system and the testis is extra-caecal. The uterus is highly convoluted, and the ovary is irregularly lobate. These features, together with the size and number of the tegumental spines per row, easily distinguish the new species from the most similar congeners Cardicola aurata Holzer et al., 2008, Cardicola chaetodontis Yamaguti, 1970, Cardicola currani Bullard and Overstreet, 2004, Cardicola forsteri Cribb et al., 2000, C. jiingurru Yong et al., 2016, and Cardicola palmeri Bullard and Overstreet, 2004, all of which infect actinopterygian fishes. Given that Cardicola is the most diverse and least host-specific of the marine aporoctoylid genera, it seems credible that a successful host-switch has occurred from an actinopterygian to D. dugon. Further sampling of sirenians and other marine mammals is warranted to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary biology and biodiversity of the blood flukes (superfamily Schistosomatoidea Stiles and Hassall, 1898), but presents a substantial challenge with respect to their conservation status and large size.", "Differentiation of Trichuris species using a morphometric approach ": "Trichuris trichiura is a nematode considered as the whipworm present in humans and primates. The systematics of the genus Trichuris is complex. Morphological studies of Trichuris isolated from primates and humans conclude that the species infecting these hosts is the same. Furthermore, numerous molecular studies have been carried out so far to discriminate parasite species from humans and Non-Human Primates using molecular techniques, but these studies were not performed in combination with a parallel morphological study. The hypothesised existence of more species of Trichuris in primates opens the possibility to revise the zoonotic potential and host specificity of T. trichiura and other putative new species of whipworms.\n                  In the present work, a study of Trichuris Roederer, 1761 (Nematoda:Trichuridae) parasitizing C. g. kikuyensis, P. ursinus, Macaca sylvanus, Pan troglodytes, and Sus scrofa domestica has been carried out using modern morphometric techniques in order to differentiate populations of Trichuris isolated from four species of captive NHP from different geographical regions, and swine, respectively.\n                  The results obtained revealed strong support for geometrical morphometrics as a useful tool to differentiate male Trichuris populations. Therefore, morphometrics in combination with other techniques, such as molecular biology analyses, ought to be applied to further the differentiation of male populations.\n                  On the other hand, morphometrics applied to female Trichuris species does not seem to contribute new information as all the measurements combinations of obtained from females always showed similar results.", "Prevalence and distribution of Babesia and Theileria species in roe deer from Spain ": "Babesiosis and Theileriosis are important worldwide-distributed tick-borne diseases for human and animals. Their presence in a particular area depends on the presence of suitable tick-vector and host species as well as competent reservoirs such as roe deer, one of the most abundant wild cervids in Spain.\n                  Spleen samples from 174 roe deer hunted in Spain were analysed to determine the prevalence of Babesia and Theileria species. DNA of both piroplasms was firstly detected using a commercial qPCR. Then, positive samples were molecularly characterized at the 18S rRNA and ITS1 genes of Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. The possible influence of some factors such as ecological area, age and sex was also assessed.\n                  Overall, 89.7% of roe deer were positive to any of the two piroplasms. Theileria spp. was more prevalent (60.9%) than Babesia spp. (19.0%); species identification could not be achieved in 17.3% of positive samples. Babesia prevalence was significantly higher in young animals and in roe deer from Oceanic regions, in contrast to Theileria spp. Five species were identified: Theileria sp. OT3 (60.3%), Babesia capreoli (15.5%), Babesia venatorum (2.9%), Theileria sp. 3185/02 (0.6%) and Babesia bigemina (0.6%). The coinfection B. capreoli/T. sp. OT3 was the most common (4.6%) followed by B. venatorum/T. sp. OT3 (0.6%) and B. bigemina/T. sp. OT3 (0.6%).\n                  Our results reveal that Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. are prevalent piroplasms in roe deer from Spain. These cervids can act as reservoirs for several Babesia and Theileria species, including the zoonotic B. venatorum. This study represents the first description of B. venatorum and B. bigemina in roe deer from Spain.", "Severe coenurosis caused by larvae of Taenia serialis in an olive baboon (Papio anubis) in Benin ": "In March 2017, a captive male juvenile (ca. 6 months old) olive baboon (Papio anubis) was brought to a primate rescue center in Benin with multiple subcutaneous swellings of unknown aetiology. At the general inspection of the body, around 15 partially mobile masses of variable sizes were found in different locations across the body. Following two surgical procedures, several cyst-like structures were removed and placed either in 10% formalin or in absolute ethanol. The cysts had a typical coenurus-like morphology. Genomic DNA was extracted from one cyst using a commercially available kit. The molecular characterization was performed by PCR amplification and sequencing of a region of the nuclear ITS-2 rDNA and a fragment of the mitochondrial 12S rDNA gene, revealing its identity as T. serialis, with 88%\u201398% similarity to T. serialis isolates from USA, Japan and Germany This study reports a new host for the larval form of T. serialis and confirms the role of primates as intermediate host, highlighting also the risk for human infection. Further genetic studies from multiple geographic isolates are needed to clarify the taxonomic status of this group.", "Gastrointestinal parasite infestation in the alpine mountain hare (Lepus timidus varronis): Are abiotic environmental factors such as elevation, temperature and precipitation affecting prevalence of parasite species? ": "Information concerning factors regulating Alpine mountain hare (Lepus timidus varronis) populations such as host-parasite interactions is missing as only a few parasitological surveys exist of this subspecies. Parasites are not only dependent on their host but also on suitable environmental conditions for infestation. Abiotic environmental factors have an important regulating role on parasites in mammals. It is estimated that the elevation range of parasites is likely to shift in response to alternate host movement and changes in climate. Here we assess the parasitic infestation in the Alpine mountain hare by analysing the parasites in faeces and comparing the parasite infestation at different elevation ranges and at varied weather conditions for two years in the Austrian Alps. Almost half of the faecal samples were free of parasites (46.2%, n\u202f=\u202f52). Most frequent was the infection by Coccidia (46.2%), whereas stomach intestine strongylids, Trichuris spp, and Cestoda were only found in 9.6% of all faeces. Hence, only Coccidia may be prevalent enough to regulate Alpine mountain hare populations in the Austrian Alps. Elevation had a significant positive effect on the infection of animals by Trichuris spp, whereas temperature had a significant negative effect on the infection by any parasite traceable in faeces and, when looking at the parasite groups individually, on Coccidia.", "Species-specific qPCR assays allow for high-resolution population assessment of four species avian schistosome that cause swimmer's itch in recreational lakes ": "Swimmer's itch is an allergic condition that occurs when the motile and infectious stage of avian schistosomes penetrate the skin of an individual. Flatworm parasites that cause swimmer's itch belong to the family Schistosomatidae. They utilize a variety of different species of bird and mammal as definitive hosts, and rely on different species of snail, in which they complete their larval development to culminate in a motile, aquatic, infectious stage called a cercaria. Recently, qPCR-based assays have been developed to monitor for swimmer's itch-causing trematodes in recreational water. This environmental DNA approach has been useful for quantifying the abundance of the free-living cercaria, the causative agent of swimmer's itch. However, the existing qPCR test amplifies from all known schistosome species, making it excellent for assessing a site for swimmer's itch potential, but not useful in determining the specific species contributing to swimmer's itch or the likely hosts (snail and bird) of the swimmer's itch-causing parasites. Thus, species-specific resolution built into a qPCR test would be useful in answering ecological questions about swimmer's itch cause, and efficacy of control efforts. This paper details bird, snail, and cercaria surveys conducted in the summer of 2018, that culminated in the development and deployment of four species-specific qPCR assays, capable of detecting Trichobilharzia stagnicolae, Trichobilharzia szidati, Trichobilharzia physellae, and Anserobilharzia brantae in recreational water. These assays were used to assess the relative abundance of each parasite in water samples collected from lakes in Northern Michigan.", "\n               Cryptosporidium spp. in wild rats (Rattus spp.) from the Hainan Province, China: Molecular detection, species/genotype identification and implications for public health ": "Wild rats (Rattus spp.) carry many zoonotic pathogens including Cryptosporidium. Due to the close proximity of rats to humans in urban environments, the potential for disease transmission is high. Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite which when ingested causes serious human illness. Despite its importance, genetic characterization of Cryptosporidium in wild rats in the Hainan province of China has not been performed. In this study, we analyzed the occurrence and genetics of Cryptosporidium in wild rats from Hainan, China. From December 2017 to October 2018, 150 wild rats were captured and fresh fecal material was collected from intestinal sections. Rat species were identified by PCR-based amplification and analysis of the vertebrate cytochrome b (cytb) gene. Cryptosporidium was examined by PCR amplification of the partial small subunit of ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). C. viatorum were subtyped by PCR analysis of the gp60 gene. A total of four rat species were identified including Asian house rats (Rattus tanezumi) (n\u202f=\u202f46), brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) (n\u202f=\u202f56), Edward's long-tailed rats (Leopoldamys edwardsi) (n\u202f=\u202f38) and muridae (Niviventer fulvescens) (n\u202f=\u202f10), with Cryptosporidium positive rates of 73.9%, 28.6%, 55.3% and 40.0%, respectively (average infection rate: 50.0%, 75/150. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of four Cryptosporidium species and two genotypes including C. viatorum (n\u202f=\u202f11); C. occultus (n\u202f=\u202f2); C. muris (n\u202f=\u202f1); and C. erinacei (n\u202f=\u202f1); rat genotypes III (n\u202f=\u202f13) and IV (n\u202f=\u202f47). Three novel subtypes of C. viatorum were identified in 6 of the 11 infected Edward's long-tailed rats: XVcA2G1a (n\u202f=\u202f4), XVcA2G1b (n\u202f=\u202f1) and XVdA3 (n\u202f=\u202f1). The identification of human pathogenic C. viatorum and zoonotic C. occultus, C. muris and C. erinacei, suggested that wild rats infected with Cryptosporidium pose a threat to human health. Taken together, these findings highlight the need to control the rat population in Hainan, China. The need to improve the public awareness of the risk of disease transmission from wild rats to humans is also highlighted.", "Prevalence and diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. in bamboo rats (Rhizomys sinensis) in South Central China ": "Cryptosporidium is one of the most prevalent zoonotic parasites and is responsible for the high burden of diarrheal disease across the globe. Rodents are globally overpopulated and are reservoirs for a variety of zoonotic pathogens. Bamboo rats are a common species of rodent that are bred for meat and wool in China. However, the genetic characterization of Cryptosporidium in bamboo rats in China is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and genetic characterization of Cryptosporidium in bamboo rats from South Central China. From February2017to February 2018, 435 fecal samples were collected from bamboo rats in 13 farms located in 12 cities in South Central China. All fecal specimens were examined for Cryptosporidium by PCR, and through sequencing the partial small subunit of ribosomal DNA (SSU rRNA). C. parvum-positive samples were further subtyped through analysis of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene sequence. Meanwhile, all the new Cryptosporidium genotypes samples were selected for further sequence characterization at the 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) gene and oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene as well as gp60 gene. Infection rates of 2.1% (9/435) were recorded for Cryptosporidium. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of two Cryptosporidium species including C. parvum (n\u202f=\u202f2), C. occultus (n\u202f=\u202f1) and two new Cryptosporidium genotypes termed Cryptosporidium bamboo rat genotype I (n\u202f=\u202f5) and Cryptosporidium bamboo rat genotype II (n\u202f=\u202f1). Two subtypes of C. parvum were identified including IIdA15G1 and IIpA19 (one each).The discovery of zoonotic Cryptosporidium species/genotypes in bamboo rats suggests they have significant zoonotic potential and pose a threat to human health. The novel sequences discovered provide new insight into genotypic variations in Cryptosporidium in bamboo rats.", "A Surgical Case of Complete Resection of the Focal Cortical and Subcortical Dysplasia in the Motor Cortex ": "Background\n                  Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are highly epileptogenic and frequently associated with medically refractory focal epilepsy. FCDs are frequently located in the frontal lobe, making its complete resection highly challenging when in proximity to the motor cortex.\n               \n               \n                  Case Description\n                  We report a case of a 25-year-old woman with medically refractory epilepsy secondary to a focal cortical dysplasia in the motor cortex and extending deeply into the subcortical white matter. A detailed presurgical evaluation and invasive electroencephalographic monitoring performed at our epilepsy monitoring unit, along with the use of motor mapping, functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and the Stealth navigation system resulted in the complete resection of the lesion without a permanent postoperative motor deficit. The patient remained seizure-free at a 63-month follow-up while being maintained on a single antiepileptic drug.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  A detailed presurgical evaluation, accurate mapping of the functional and dysplastic cortex, and a well-planned tailored and complete surgical resection of the cortical dysplasia can result in a favorable outcome with relatively little risk of postoperative neurologic deficit.", "Freehand C2 Pedicle Screw Placement: Surgical Anatomy and Operative Technique ": "We present a surgical video demonstrating the anatomy and technique of freehand C2 pedicle screw placement using a cadaveric specimen and 3-dimensional simulation software. C2 pedicle screws have been shown to augment cervical constructs and provide increased biomechanical stability compared with pars screws due to the increased length and bony purchase of pedicle screws within the pedicle and vertebral body.\n                        1\n                      The presence of vertebral artery variations within the transverse foramen may preclude pedicle screw placement, and these should be identified on preoperative imaging. The C2 pedicle can be directly palpated at the time of screw placement, which aids screw placement in cases of deformity or trauma. A freehand technique without the use of computed tomography scan guidance or intraoperative fluoroscopy decreases radiation exposure for the operator and patient and has been shown to be safe for patient-related outcomes.\n                        2-5\n                      Complete exposure of the C2 posterior elements is key to identifying the pedicle. The trajectory is based on direct visualization of the medial and superior pedicle borders to avoid lateral or inferior breaches into the transverse foramen. A curved probe is used for access into the vertebral body, respecting the outer cortical walls of the pedicle. The intraosseous position is confirmed with a ball-tipped probe. Fluoroscopy should be performed after screw placement to confirm proper position. By accomplishing proper exposure and understanding the anatomy of the C2 pedicle, the placement of C2 pedicle screws using a freehand technique is a safe and efficient technique for high cervical fixation.", "Using a Smartphone as an Exoscope Where an Operating Microscope is not Available ": "Objective\n                  Neurosurgical operating rooms are equipped with microscopes in order to provide a good standard of care. Nevertheless, in developing countries, microscopes are not always available. During a short period in a western Africa hospital, we adapted our smartphones as a valid alternative to the microscope.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Using a shaped tin can, a smartphone cover, and a rod fixed to the bed, we could make a support for a smartphone creating a simple \u201chomemade\u201d exoscope, which allowed us to have magnification and light in the surgical field.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Among others, we performed 5 surgical interventions of both spinal and brain surgery using our smartphone as a magnifier.

It can be a useful solution in developing countries where often nothing better is available.", "Why social sustainability counts: The impact of corporate social sustainability culture on financial success ": "Awareness is growing in European companies of the importance of managing all aspects of sustainability. However, the elusive social aspect of sustainability and its influence on successful business has been under-investigated in corporate culture literature so far. The aim of this paper is to examine whether a correlation can be found between corporate social sustainability culture (expressed as explicit \u201citems\u201d of corporate values and practices emphasizing employee and societal well-being) and the financial success of a company. This is examined through a multiple regression analysis of two contrasting European polls, examining items indicating corporate social sustainability culture, and financial outcomes. The empirical results show that four specific success-related social sustainability dimensions of corporate culture are predictors of a company being classified as financially successful. These are: Sustainability strategy and leadership; Mission, communication and learning; Social care and work life; and Loyalty and identification. The paper contributes to the understanding of how to manage corporate social sustainability culture whilst supporting companies\u2019 financial performance, and provides evidence-grounded recommendations to business managers and stakeholders aiming to manage social sustainability proactively by undertaking cultural change and development initiatives.", "Measuring sustainable food consumption: A case study on organic food ": "This study aims to contribute to the debate on consumers\u2019 food buying practices with regard to sustainability issues, and specifically to preferences for organic. In order to analyse organic food buying practices in depth, this paper proposes a methodology of analysis based on two steps. First of all, a fuzzy logic has been used for the construction of composite index. In particular, we propose three indices that summarize a set of variables for measuring organic consumption intensity (OCI), the degree of both food sustainability concerns (FSCI) and sustainability in consumers\u2019 lifestyle (SLI). Then a regression has been implemented to analyse if organic consumption intensity is affected by the other two previously mentioned indices (FSCI and SLI), and by other selected covariates. As case study, survey data on a sample of consumers resident in Campania (a region in south of Italy) have been used. From our results it emerges that consumers with a high OCI show a higher level of sustainability concern in their general food choices and have a more sustainable lifestyle. Furthermore, food scares and concerns over food safety are strong predictors of organic consumption intensity. Lastly, women and young people show a higher intensity of organic food consumption. Overall, these empirical findings suggest to industry practitioners and policy makers that to increase organic food consumption efforts should be made, to communicate health, as well as environmental and social benefits related to the production and consumption of such food, focusing on younger consumers as key stakeholders in the transition towards more sustainable food systems.", "Integrated quality and supply chain management business diagnostics for organizational sustainability improvement ": "A growing number of organizations are integrating economic, ecologic and financial sustainability considerations into their management processes, driven by increased societal and stakeholder pressures. With a view to support organizations in this global challenge, this paper examines integration of sustainability into the two influential management approaches of quality management and supply chain management. To achieve this, a critical evaluation of the extant integrated models in the literature is undertaken, analyzing strengths and weaknesses and evidencing the limitations. Stemming from the gaps identified, a conceptual framework is formulated, holistically incorporating quality and supply chain management principles for organizational triple bottom line sustainable development. A road map for industrial practitioners is presented along with a business diagnostic tool that were constructed on the basis of novel, synergistic relationships established between the management principles of quality, supply chain integration and sustainability of organizations.", "Occurrence of microplastics and its pollution in the environment: A review ": "The pollution caused by microplastics in seas and fresh water is of growing environmental concern due to their slow degradability, biological ingestion by fish and other aquatic living organisms, and acting as carriers to concentrate and transport synthetic and persistent organic pollutants. As well as microplastics, chemical additives added to plastics during manufacture which may leach out upon ingestion, will enter food chains and potentially cause humans serious health problems.\n                  Regulations in many counties/regions have been setup or to be implemented to ban the production/sale and use of primary microplastics (e.g., microbeads), which could reduce microplastics in the aquatic environment in certain level. However, the fragments from larger plastic items (second microplastics) are major contributors, and then new legislations have to be proposed and implemented in order to substantially reduce the amounts of microplastics in the environment and the associated environmental impact. Moreover, approaches and measures are to be taken by encouraging companies and all users to adopt the Reduce\u2013Reuse\u2013Recycle circular economy as this will represent a cost-effective way of reducing the quantity of plastic objects and microplastics particles entering and gathering in the marine/aquatic environment.", "Aligning sustainability assessment with responsible research and innovation: Towards a framework for Constructive Sustainability Assessment ": "Emerging technologies are increasingly promoted on the promise of tackling the grand challenge of sustainability. A range of assessment and governance approaches seek to evaluate these claims, but these tend to be applied disparately and lack widespread operationalisation. They also face specific challenges, such as high levels of uncertainty, when it comes to emerging technologies. Building and reflecting on both theory and practice, this article develops a framework for Constructive Sustainability Assessment (CSA) that enables the application of sustainability assessments to emerging technologies as part of a broader deliberative approach. In order to achieve this, we discuss and critique current approaches to analytical sustainability assessment and review deliberative social science governance frameworks. We then develop the conceptual basis of CSA - blending life-cycle thinking with principles of responsible research and innovation. This results in four design principles \u2013 transdisciplinarity, opening-up, exploring uncertainty and anticipation \u2013 that can be followed when applying sustainability assessments to emerging technologies. Finally, we discuss the practical implementation of the framework through a three-step process to (a) formulate the sustainability assessment in collaboration with stakeholders, (b) evaluate potential sustainability implications using methods such as anticipatory life-cycle assessment and (c) interpret and explore the results as part of a deliberative process. Through this, CSA facilitates a much-needed transdisciplinary response to enable the governance of emerging technologies towards sustainability. The framework will be of interest to scientists, engineers, and policy-makers working with emerging technologies that have sustainability as an explicit or implicit motivator.", "Collaborative consumption: The influence of fashion leadership, need for uniqueness, and materialism on female consumers\u2019 adoption of clothing renting and swapping ": "Over-consumption and a throwaway culture contribute to increased textile waste, which is a growing environmental concern. Collaborative consumption may encourage the reuse of products and reduce new purchases to prevent excessive textile waste. The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of personality traits on consumers\u2019 intention to engage in collaborative consumption through clothing renting and swapping. By applying the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study considers that engaging in collaborative consumption is not only from an individual\u2019s inner characteristics but also from self-interest and social values. An online survey was conducted with 431 US females. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test proposed hypotheses. The results indicated that three personality traits, including fashion leadership, need for uniqueness, and materialism, significantly influence the intention to rent and swap clothing. Further, personality indirectly influences the intention to adopt collaborative consumption through attitude, perceived behavioral control, and past sustainable behavior. This study highlights the role of personality traits, attitude, perceived ability and past experiences on collaborative consumption, and provides guidance and suggestions for clothing renting and swapping businesses.", "Determinants of sustainable supply chain management: A case study from the oil and gas supply chain ": "The global economy is significantly dependent on the Oil and Gas (O&G) sector. However, this sector has a considerably negative impact on the environment and society. A Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) system can help towards addressing some of the environmental and social issues in the\u00a0sector. Recent research on SSCM in the case sector is limited, and determinants that influence the adoption/implementation of the SSCM practices and their influence on the Operational and Business Performance (OPR) have not been deeply analyzed. The present study tries to bridge this research gap by identifying and analyzing the influence of determinants of SSCM on the OPR of the case supply chain in the Indian context. This study has been carried out in two stages; in the first stage, Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methodology was employed for establishing the mutual relationship between the determinants. Also, the dependency of OPR on the determinants was identified. Later, in the second stage, primary data on determinants of SSCM and their impact on OPR were collected. Then, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) methodology was employed for analyzing the data. The ISM approach led to the inference that one determinant namely \u2018Regulatory Pressure (RP)\u2019 had the highest driving power; on the other hand, results of the SEM methodology showed that one determinant namely \u2018Collaborative Green Logistics (Forward & Reverse) (CGLC)\u2019 had a significant influence on the OPR. These results are intended to guide the researchers and environmentalists as well as government policy- and decision-makers, and organizational managers in understanding the various determinants, their interrelationship and influence on the OPR.", "Producing PHAs in the bioeconomy \u2014 Towards a sustainable bioplastic ": "Biodegradable polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can reduce pollution caused by the increasing global polymer demand. Although industrial production of PHAs grew rapidly in the past years, their total market share is still marginal. While this is often attributed to their higher price, which is mainly caused by high production costs, the industrial success of PHAs can also depend on policy framework. Environmental assessment tools such as life cycle analysis and the product environmental footprint showed that PHAs can contribute to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, waste reduction as well as green jobs and innovation in the biotechnology sector. As many countries aspire to these targets under the umbrella of bioeconomy concepts, inclusion into the respective policies can stimulate industrial PHA production. With a high variability in the industrial production of PHAs in terms of feedstock, energy source, polymer properties etc., the choice of optimization criteria influences the design of new production processes. Considering the political targets for bioeconomy products is therefore useful to direct the technical design of sustainable PHA production, for example in integrated lignocellulose biorefineries.", "A framework to measure corporate sustainability performance: A strong sustainability-based view of firm ": "This paper proposes a framework to measure corporate sustainability performance by designing a composite sustainability index. Two core concepts form the basis of the proposed corporate sustainability index: (a) the triple-bottom-line approach and (b) the principles of strong sustainability. More specifically, the proposed index simultaneously combines the economic, environmental and social components of sustainability integrating the concept of thresholds into the logic composite index of corporate sustainability performance measurement so as to address some basic principles of strong sustainability. This implies that thresholds could be associated with the concept of carrying capacity, safe minimum standards and critical capital. Finally, a computational example has been designed in order to show the practical implications of the proposed index. The findings indicate that social and environmental thresholds could play a critical role in the overall sustainability performance of firms and the proposed index could be a good tool for scholars and practitioners to understand the logic of measuring corporate strong sustainability performance.", "Evaluating the environmental sustainability of cakes ": "Cakes are a favourite food across the globe and yet little is known about their environmental sustainability. To address this research gap, this paper evaluates the life cycle environmental impacts associated with the production and consumption of industrially-produced cakes. The following main product categories are considered: whole cakes, cake slices, pies, cupcakes and cheesecake. The results reveal that whole cakes have the lowest impacts for 13 out of 18 categories considered. Cheesecake is environmentally the least sustainable option, with all impacts but terrestrial ecotoxicity higher than any other cake type. Raw materials are the major contributors to the majority of impact categories (22%\u201398%), followed by packaging and manufacturing. Wheat flour, sugar, palm oil and milk-based ingredients are the main hotspots in the life cycle. A range of improvement opportunities is considered across the supply chain. For example, decreasing sugar content in cakes by 30% would lower the impacts by up to 3%\u201311%, while reducing the amount of packaging and energy used in manufacturing would lower the impacts cumulatively by 9%\u201323%. Minimising waste would decrease water ecotoxicity by 6%\u201328%. Based on annual consumption in the UK, the cakes sector contributes 2% to the energy consumption and 1% to the GHG emissions of the whole food sector. The results of this work can assist the industry and government in benchmarking the sector and minimising its environmental impacts. The findings will also be of interest to consumers in identifying environmentally more sustainable cake alternatives.", "Effectiveness of sustainability labels in guiding food choices: Analysis of visibility and understanding among young adults ": "The increasing demand for sustainable food products has driven manufacturers to adopt many sustainability claims, certifications, messages and other information tools to differentiate their goods. The results of an online survey, conducted in southern Italy on a sample of 305 individuals aged between 18 and 26 years, reveal that the level of visibility of sustainability labels is low. In particular, Rainforest Alliance certification and Libera Terra have never been noted by large shares of respondents (respectively 75% and 68%). Moreover, the degree of understanding of these labels is generally low, except for the organic one. The correct definition is stated only by 15% of interviewees for Fair Trade; 25% for Libera Terra and 16% for Rainforest Alliance. Furthermore, there is a significant relationship (\n                        \u03c7\n                     <0.05) between visibility and understanding for all the labels; suggesting that label visibility strongly impacts the probability of having a higher understanding. Findings suggest that food firms should be cautious investing in sustainability labels unless they are combined with effective information policies to increase familiarity among specific market segments.", "Environmental sustainability issues in the food\u2013energy\u2013water nexus: Breakfast cereals and snacks ": "Understanding environmental impacts of complete food supply chains is important for the food industry to help devise strategies for reducing the impacts of current and future products. Breakfast cereals are one of the most important foods consumed in many countries, but their environmental impacts are currently unknown. Therefore, this study explores the environmental sustainability issues in the food\u2013energy\u2013water nexus by considering breakfast cereals manufactured by one of the world\u2019s largest producers, Kellogg Europe. A life cycle assessment has been carried out for these purposes with the aim of helping the Company to integrate environmental sustainability considerations into the design of their products and packaging. The results indicate that the average global warming potential (GWP) of Kellogg\u2019s breakfast cereals is 2.64 kg CO\n                        \n                           \n                           \n                              2\n                           \n                        \n                      eq. per kg of product. The main GWP hotspots are the ingredients (48%) and energy used in the manufacturing process (23%); packaging and transport contribute 15% each. Rice is the single largest contributor to the GWP of the ingredients (38%). The manufacturing stage is the main contributor of primary energy demand (34%), while the ingredients are responsible for more than 90% of the water footprint. The ingredients are also the main contributors to most other environmental impacts, including land use (97%), depletion of elements (61%), eutrophication (71%), human toxicity (54%) and photochemical smog (50%). The impacts from packaging are high for freshwater and marine toxicity. The contribution of transport is significant for depletion of elements and fossil resources (23%), acidification (32%), ozone depletion (28%) and photochemical smog (24%). Improvement opportunities explored in the paper include better agricultural practices, recipe modifications, improved energy efficiency of manufacturing processes and use of alternative packaging. Impacts from consumption are also discussed.", "Plant-based materials and transitioning to a circular economy ": "Plant-based materials play an integral part in transitioning to a circular economy. Bioplastics are a growing industry but still account for less than 1% of the total plastic production. Cellulose and starch are abundant, widely available plant polymers that are used extensively for paper, packaging, food service items, bags and biofuels. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) which is derived from starch by a fermentation process and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) which are renewable, microbial derived biodegradable polyesters that can be processed similar to various commodity plastics. Both polymers are projected to grasp an increasing market share of commodity plastics as production costs drop. Other synthetic biodegradable polyesters and plant-based commodity plastics are commercially available and have expanding markets. The growing use of plant-based materials will have environmental benefits including waste reduction, lower greenhouse gas emissions, promote rural investment, reduce the volume of harmful chemicals/pollutants, conserve ecosystems and biodiversity, and will help transition to the circular economy.", "Analyzing the barriers of green textile supply chain management in Southeast Asia using interpretive structural modeling ": "Southeast Asian countries have become the production hub of lean textile and apparel supply chain. Textile supply chain consumes huge amount of natural resources and emits polluting effluents and gases creating serious environmental and human health concerns. Green design, green procurement, green operations and green transportation are the major areas of green supply chain management. This paper attempts to analyze the important barriers of green textile and apparel supply chain management in Southeast Asian countries. Twelve important barriers have been identified through literature review and questionnaire survey. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) has been used to decipher the contextual relationships among the barriers. Complexity of green process and system design was found to be the most elementary barrier having the maximum driving power. Lack of consumer support and encouragement, lack of guidance and support from regulatory authorities and high implementation and maintenance cost are the other elementary barriers of green textile supply chain. Lack of green suppliers is the most dependent barrier which is influenced by all other barriers considered in this research. Elimination of root causes or driving barriers are paramount to save the environment. Concerted efforts in terms of green technological innovation, consumers\u2019 awareness and support of the regulatory bodies are needed for effective implementation of green supply practices in textile and apparel supply chains.", "Value\u2013Supply Chain Analysis (VSCA) of crude palm oil production in Brazil, focusing on economic, environmental and social sustainability ": "This paper is an evidenced-based analysis of sustainability (based on carbon, energy, blue-water, labour and economic footprints) of crude palm oil (CPO) production in Par\u00e1, Brazil. It includes cradle to gate value/supply chain-based life cycle analysis (LCA), a socio-economic analysis of small holder farmers in Para; and a discussion on how operational and supply chain management (SCM) methods can assist practical application of LCA results. The LCA consists of 4 stages: nursery; plantation management; harvesting and transport of fresh fruits; and, extraction of CPO. The analysis was based on direct data obtained between November 2014 and August 2015. The total carbon footprint (CFP) was 1.5 kgCO2eq /L CPO and the total energy footprint (EFP) was 5.1 MJ/L CPO. The life cycle based cost is US$ 0.7/L of CPO and the largest cost comes from harvesting and transport (45%). The study uncovered many sustainability hotspots. The carbon hotspots were: methane emissions from waste water at the Oil Extraction stage, and fertilizer use from the Plantation Management stage. Fertilizer use is a key hotspot in all 3 areas: carbon, energy and economic cost. Given the plantation is only 5 years old, high consumption of fertilizer is expected. However, reducing N-fertilizers will help lower all three footprints. A sensitivity analysis shows that if the direct N2O emission factor was doubled, the CFP value at plantation stage could go as high as 49%, and the total CFP value could increase by 18%. If fertilizers were produced using modern technology, the total CFP value could go down by 13%, while the value at the plantation would go down by 29%. For methane emissions, the use of modern technologies to capture biogas from waste water has potential to reduce emissions significantly. Biofuel use at the Extraction stage is a win\u2013win outcome with regard to carbon emissions, energy use and economic cost. However, biofuel use causes significant local environmental pollution and human health risks such as dark smoke and particulate matter. The blue-water footprint was 6.8 per L of CPO. Reduction of water consumption by increasing water efficiency at the extraction mills is important, because water extraction by mills is a serious threat to the local river basin. As a fraction of the total number of employees in the entire system, the highest labour use (68%) is at the Plantation Management stage. The analysis of smallholder farmers raises questions about the popular justification of palm oil plantations as a provider of rural employer and argues that indicators like community welfare and income inequality must be evaluated, because the extent to which the industry will enhance sustainable development depend on the way they combine with local communities, directly and indirectly.", "Sustainability checklist in support of the design of food processing ": "To source food ingredients produced by best practice, reducing food loss in the processing line and implementation of new technologies are some examples of changes in the management in the food and drink sector that may offer advantages from a sustainability perspective. There are several tools and methods for evaluating sustainability for a food processing technology but often specific methodological knowledge is essential and many companies may not be able to carry out such a study due to time constraints and lack of data. The aim of this paper is to provide a tool with the format of a qualitative sustainability checklist, based on existing Life Cycle Assessment theory. The checklist is devoted to the design and adaptation of processing in the food industry to clarify the potential hot spots in new process design and is focused on environmental sustainability, although other aspects were conferred as well to demonstrate its potential. To identify the potential of this kind of checklist, it was tested by four food companies. The participant feedback was in general positive. The companies highlighted the benefits of creating awareness of sustainability issues within the company and providing a good overview without data collection. From a scientific point of view, the approach can help to overcome several challenges in sustainability assessment in the agri-food sector, especially some modeling issues and spatio-temporal resolution.", "The effects of sustainable practices and managers\u2019 leadership competences on sustainability performance of construction firms ": "Sustainable practices performed throughout the construction project cycle positively affect the environment, society, and economy \u2013 three dimensions of sustainability. Awareness of the importance of sustainable practices\u2019 implementation is currently greater than in the past. In this regard, leaders need to integrate sustainability into firm activities, making the business strategy\u2019s sustainable development part. However, the understanding of leadership and its linkage to sustainable construction are still limited, thus more work is required to establish the leaders\u2019 vital role in the implementation of sustainable practices. To our knowledge, the extant literature still lacks the empirical evidence to prove the relationships among sustainable practices, sustainability performance, and leadership competences of construction managers. Therefore, this study developed a survey questionnaire to collect data and used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to empirically investigate the relationships between sustainable practices (environmental, economic, and social) and sustainability performance and the moderating effect of construction managers\u2019 leadership competences on these relationships. The findings revealed that environmental, economic, and social practices have the positive influences on sustainability performance. Moreover, this study also discovered that leadership competences strengthen the environmental practices-sustainability performance relationship. However, we did not find the empirical evidence to support the moderating effect of leadership competences on the relationships between economic, social practices and sustainability performance. This study attempts to fill the certain gaps of the sustainable construction literature and provides researchers and construction managers with a deeper understanding of the roles of sustainable practices and construction managers\u2019 leadership competences in sustainable construction.", "Influences of environmental and hedonic motivations on intention to purchase green products: An extension of the theory of planned behavior ": "Responding to prior research that has been equivocal on the role of general environmental motivations and addressing arguments on hedonic motivations in purchasing green products, the purpose of our study was to specify a hierarchical model of green purchasing. Environmental concern and environmental knowledge along with adventurous spirit as general environmental and hedonic motivations were examined. Situation- and issue-specific motivations, perceived environmental effectiveness, and novelty seeking were also included in the model. Data was collected from 284 adults enrolled in an online panel survey. The three TPB constructs accounted for 50.8% of the variance in purchase intention but only attitude and subjective norm had appreciable effects. Findings supported the claim that it is situation- and issue-specific motivations that are direct constructs of a specific behavior rather than general motivations. Environmental knowledge had an appreciable effect in explaining purchase intention while environmental concern did not. When novelty seeking was controlled, adventurous spirit accounted for no additional variance in purchase intention.", "Input\u2013output optimisation model for sustainable oil palm plantation development ": "Due to the increase in global demand for palm oil products, the oil palm industry has continued to expand in the past decades. Continuous production of fresh fruit bunches in oil palm plantation is essential to meet this growing demand. Meanwhile, the productivity of plantations is highly dependent on the supply of resources (e.g., water, fertilisers and sunlight) and on proper plantation management systems. The harvested fresh fruit bunches from oil palm plantations have to be immediately sent to palm oil mills to ensure the quality of the crude palm oil and crude palm kernel oil. In this study, oil palm plantation operations are optimised using an input\u2013output model to determine maximum yield with minimum plantation size and greenhouse gases emissions. Multiple scenarios can be incorporated in the proposed model. To illustrate the proposed model, a case study of an oil palm plantation supplying fresh fruit bunches for a 60 t/h capacity palm oil mill in Malaysia is presented. Various plantation management practices with different resources supply constraints are considered. Based on the optimised result, the sustainability of a plantation is greatly improved. The plantation area needed to meet the requirement of the palm oil mill is reduced by 24% when using combined organic and inorganic fertilisers. A significant drop in greenhouse gases emissions from 282.95 to 200.73 kt CO2e/y can thus be achieved. This result implies that widespread use of such optimal practices can help meet growing global demand without the need to convert pristine ecosystems into new plantations.", "Web-based platform for eco-sustainable supply chain management ": "The increasing focus on environmental practices has led academia and industry to address eco-sustainability in different ways. Recent improvements to supply chain management (SCM) have also included environmental sustainability as a key factor, in addition to common drivers such as risk, supply quality, and cost. Although several eco-sustainable SCM approaches have been proposed, often those solutions remain too theoretical and difficult to implement. This paper contributes to this research topic by proposing a web-based platform capable of tracing suppliers and related processes along the entire product supply chain (SC). This platform is a powerful decision-making tool for improving overall SC environmental sustainability. A structured methodology is defined and implemented that can efficiently model complex SCs, share data between actors, and measure its environmental sustainability. To demonstrate the platform applicability and validate its effectiveness in industrial settings, a case study of industrial partners involved in the production of leather shoes is provided.", "Evolving theories of eco-innovation: A systematic review ": "Eco-innovation has become an essential entity for greening the economy. Technological innovations, institutional reforms, and change in social practices are some of the means of eco-innovation. As a result, there is a wide discourse on the many dimensions of eco-innovation since the dawn of the millennium. However, the concept of eco-innovation lacks theoretical consistency; hence, it has remained narrow and disintegrated. Therefore, this study conducts a systematic review of the articles focusing on the significance of theories in relation to the process of eco-innovation, in order to investigate the evolving theories of eco-innovation, highlight the existing research gaps, and to identify directions for potential theoretical development that would be valuable for a deeper system change. The findings show resource-based view, institutional theory, stakeholders theory, and evolutionary theory to be the most commonly used theories, along with identification of material-based enterprises as the primary sectors of implementation exhibiting a strong technological bias. The findings indicate that eco-innovations are primarily perceived from a narrow set of neo-liberal notions that although is effective for incremental improvements, lack credibility for defining the differentiated approach associated with radical eco-innovations. Accordingly, selective pressure by means of policy making process,\u00a0design dynamic, and societal demand are identified as gray areas requiring greater theoretical attention. An analytical framework built on technological, institutional, organizational and social eco-innovation is represented for exploring the research areas of system change, economic sustainability, product network sustainability, and socio-technical landscape, that facilitates sustainability transition.", "Exploring young adult consumers\u2019 sustainable clothing consumption intention-behavior gap: A Behavioral Reasoning Theory perspective ": "Clothing overconsumption is a growing global phenomenon with serious effects on the environment and society. Huge amounts of textile waste are ending up U.S. landfills due to unsustainable clothing consumption patterns. With the conceptual underpinnings of Behavioral Reasoning Theory, the purpose of this study was to explore sustainable clothing consumption behaviors (SCCBs) that young consumers were most and least likely to engage in and to understand specific reasons for their decisions to engage in a variety of SCCBs. The study used qualitative method of inquiry and conducted six focus groups with forty-one young adult consumers. Data was transcribed and analyzed to develop specific reasons that the participants attached to engage or not engage in SCCBs. Qualitative analyses revealed that participants\u2019 reasons for engaging in SCCBs included perceived value, sustainability commitment, uniqueness, acquisition from known sources and lifestyle changes. Specific reasons for not engaging in SCCBs included perceived lack of variety/style, budget constraints, skepticism, lack of knowledge/skills, emotions attached to consumption, perceived lack of availability and consumers\u2019 self-indulgent behavior. The findings of this study provide important implications for public policy makers and businesses to integrate and promote circularity in the fashion industry. The study also emphasizes the important role consumers\u2019 play in extending clothing lifecycle.", "A review of optimization and decision-making models for the planning of \n                  \n                     \n                        CO\n                     \n                     \n                        2\n                     \n                  \n                capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) systems ": "Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is considered as one of the key strategies for mitigating climate change.

Combining CCS and CCU can potentially result in valuable symbiosis, but remains debatable due to gaps between the roles of these technologies in energy engineering. Such gaps have resulted in slower commercial deployment of CO2 \u201c-capture. Some important issues resulting from these technologies have been addressed in previous studies through process systems engineering (PSE) methodologies, which are able to provide rigorous decision support during CCUS planning. This review paper provides an in-depth discussion of the state-of-the-art of these tools, and also discusses recent developments on integrating CCUS components in large-scale planning. While recent literature in this area reveals the availability of tools for planning and policy-making, further research opportunities are identified through the bibliometric trends that show how CCUS research can develop further.", "Influencing factors for the purchase intention of consumers choosing bioplastic products in Germany ": "Plastic pollution is a massive global issue and it is increasing. However, there are possible solutions besides the abstinence of plastic-consumption. Particularly, bioplastics could be one part of the solution. So far, there has been little research on the consumption of bioplastic-products and consumers\u2019 choice behavior for bioplastics. We conducted the largest study so far, on preferences, choice, attitude, and perception in the context of bioplastics. Our sample of 1673 participants is representative of the German population including citizens 16 years of age and older, who were surveyed through an Online Access Panel. We conducted a logistic regression analysis combining the purchase intention for bioplastic-products as the dependent variable with 12 independent variables derived from the literature review. We found significant and comparably high influences on the purchase intention from the variables attitude towards bioplastics, green consumer values, product experience and interest in information on bioplastics. Politics and economic stakeholders promoting marketing and information activities related to bioplastic products can use the findings of this study.", "Increasing textile circulation\u2014Consequences and requirements ": "The global textile fiber production, consumption of textiles and amounts of textile waste are constantly growing. The increase of textile waste has also been demonstrated in sorting studies performed for the municipal solid waste, where the share of textiles has grown. Ideally, recycling and, even more so, reusing textiles can reduce the production of new textiles from virgin materials and hence reduce the use of water, energy and chemicals in the production chain. The aim of the study was to ascertain the flows of textiles and textile waste currently in Finland and assess the environmental performance of the current system. In addition, the possible consequences of a significant increase in the reuse or recycling of discarded textiles were analyzed. Finally, an assessment on the policy measures available for increasing textile circulation was performed.\n                  An account of the textiles and textile waste flows in Finland in 2012 showed that roughly 20% of discarded textiles were collected separately by charity organizations and directed mainly towards reuse. Only a few percent of the overall flow was recycled. The majority of the discarded textiles were collected in municipal solid waste (MSW) and incinerated with energy recovery. The life cycle assessment (LCA) of the current situation and two comparing scenarios showed that environmental benefits could be obtained by increasing the separate collection of discarded textiles and their reuse or recycling. The results were dominated by the benefits potentially obtained from compensating virgin textile production with reuse or recycling. However, it is not known how much textile reuse actually compensates virgin production, or whether it simply generates new markets and adds to the overall demand and consumption of textiles. Similarly, there are uncertainties about whether recycled fibers can replace virgin fibers due to the fact that chemical recycling processes are still being developed. Research and development activities are already in progress for increasing the circulation of textiles. While developing the textile chain it must be taken into account that the whole chain for collecting, sorting, separating and recovering needs to be developed simultaneously and the operations optimized in order to keep environmental impacts to a minimum.\n                  Well-accepted voluntary producer responsibility could be one way to increase the collection of discarded textiles, but it requires the engagement of producers, operators and consumers. The use of recycling criteria in public procurements to enhance recycling requires an increase of recycled products in the market and advice for procurers.\n                  Both increased reuse and increased recycling require major changes to the current system and the engagement of all operators of the textile chain.", "Use of monoethanolamine (MEA) for CO2 capture in a global scenario: Consequences and alternatives ": "Recent research on CO2 capture is focusing on the optimization of CO2 absorption using amines (mainly monoethanolamine\u2014MEA) in order to minimize the energy consumption of this very energy-intensive process and improve the absorption efficiency. Process optimization is always required and this research is worth and necessary. However, the main concern arises when thinking of the overall process: solvent production, solvent use and regeneration, and environmental effects related to its use/emissions. The production of MEA from ammonia involves important CO2 emissions during the Haber\u2013Bosch process. The regeneration of the solvent after the absorption is also an indirect source of CO2 related to the use of fuels (i.e., combustion processes for energy supply). Thus, the evaluation of the overall balance of CO2 emitted and captured is essential to determine the efficiency of the process. In addition, other environmental impacts associated to the toxicity and environmental fate of the solvent have to be considered. The use of MEA and other amines in CO2 capture is a point of concern and a global application does not seem to be the best strategy.\n                  This review aims at giving an overview of the main implications of using MEA as absorption solvent for CO2 capture together with the last advances in research to improve the conventional absorption process. Furthermore, alternatives of using other solvents and/or using other technology and their advantages and weak points will be briefly provided. An approach oriented to produce CO2-based products with economic value that can be re-integrated in a closed carbon loop, reducing the use of fresh materials and decreasing the production cost, should be the final objective of current research on CO2 capture.", "Environmental issues in seawater reverse osmosis desalination: Intakes and outfalls ": "Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination has some environmental impacts associated with the construction and operation of intake systems and the disposal of concentrate. The primary impact of conventional open-ocean intake systems is the impingement and entrainment of marine organisms. These impacts can be minimized by locating the intake in a geographic position where oceanic productivity is low. Velocity-cap intakes tend to reduce impacts by minimizing the number of fish entrained and some new traveling screens can allow the survival of some marine organisms. Mitigation, such as environmental restoration of habitat or restocking, can provide an acceptable solution to impacts where they are significant. Subsurface intake systems avoid impingement and entrainment impacts, but can cause other, less important impacts (e.g., visual, beach access). Concentrate disposal can locally impact benthic communities, if poorly diluted discharge is allowed to flow across the marine bottom. Impacts to benthic communities from concentrate discharges can be minimized by using properly-designed diffuser systems, designed and located based current and flow modeling.\n                  The experiences of SWRO desalination to date indicate that environmental impacts can be satisfactorily minimized with proper design based on a reasonably complete environmental impact analysis prior to facility siting and design.", "Carbon nanotube membranes for water purification: A bright future in water desalination ": "Water pollutants have huge impacts on the entire living systems including terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial flora and fauna. In addition to conventional priority, and newly emerging micro/nano-pollutants, increasing global warming and consequent climate changes are posing major threats to the fresh water availability. Global warming and climate change are constantly increasing the salinity level of both land and sea water, dwindling the availability of existing fresh water for household, agriculture and industry. This has made it urgent to invent an appropriate water treatment technology that not only removes macro-, micro- and nano-pollutants but also desalinates water to a significant extent. Tip-functionalized nonpolar interior home of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) provides strong invitation to polar water molecules and rejects salts and pollutants. Low energy consumption, antifouling and self-cleaning functions have made CNT membranes extraordinary over the conventional ones. We comprehensively reviewed here molecular modeling and experimental aspects of CNT-membrane fabrication and functionalization for the desalination of both sea and brackish water. We present here the current problems and future challenges in water treatments. The article is potentially important for the hydrologists, membrane technologists, environmentalists and industrialists working in the field of water purification technologies to eradicate fresh water crisis in near future.", "Reverse osmosis desalination: A state-of-the-art review ": "Water scarcity is a grand challenge that has always stimulated research interests in finding effective means for pure water production. In this context, reverse osmosis (RO) is considered the leading and the most optimized membrane-based desalination process that is currently dominating the desalination market. In this review, various aspects of RO desalination are reviewed. Theories and models related to concentration polarization and membrane transport, as well as merits and drawbacks of these models in predicting polarization effects, are discussed. An updated review of studies related to membrane modules (plate and frame, tubular, spiral wound, and hollow fiber) and membrane characterization are provided. The review also discusses membrane cleaning and different pre-treatment technologies in place for RO desalination, such as feed-water pre-treatment and biocides. RO pre-treatment technologies, which include conventional (e.g., coagulation-flocculation, media filtration, disinfection, scale inhibition) and non-conventional (e.g., MF, UF, and NF) are reviewed and their relative attributes are compared. As per the available literature, UF, MF and coagulation-flocculation are considered the most widely used pre-treatment technologies. In addition, this review discusses membrane fouling, which represents a serious challenge in RO processes due to its significant contribution to energy requirements and process economy (e.g., flux decline, permeate quality, membrane lifespan, increased feed pressure, increased pre-treatment and membrane maintenance cost). Different membrane fouling types, such as colloidal, organic, inorganic, and biological fouling, are addressed in this review. Principles of RO process design and the embedded economic and energy considerations are discussed. In general, cost of water desalination has dropped to values that made it a viable option, comparable even to conventional water treatment methods. Finally, an overview of hybrid RO desalination processes and the current challenges faced by RO desalination processes are presented and discussed.", "Applications of capacitive deionization: Desalination, softening, selective removal, and energy efficiency ": "Capacitive deionization (CDI) has attracted a great attention as a promising desalination technology, and studies on CDI have increased significantly in the last ten years. However, there have been no guidelines for developing strategies involving CDI technology for specific applications. Therefore, our work presents a critical review of the recent advances in CDI to meet the technical requirements of various applicable areas, with an emphasis on hybrid systems. This paper first summarizes the major developments made on novel electrode materials for CDI for brackish water desalination. Then, CDI and reverse osmosis (RO) integrated systems are critically reviewed for both ultrapure water production and wastewater treatment. Additionally, the applicability of CDI on various industrial processes is discussed, covering two distinct topics: (1) water softening and (2) selective removal of valuable heavy metals and nutrients (nitrate/phosphate). Lastly, recent improvements on the energy efficiency of CDI processes are delineated, specifically focusing on energy recovery and hybridization with energy producing technology, such as reverse electrodialysis (RED) and microbial fuel cells (MFC). This review paper is expected to share the practical experience of CDI applications as well as to provide guidelines for electrode material development for each specific application.", "Nanofiltration membranes review: Recent advances and future prospects ": "Nanofiltration (NF) membranes have come a long way since it was first introduced during the late 80's. With properties in between those of ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO), NF membranes have been used in many interesting applications especially in water and wastewater treatment and desalination. Other applications include those in pharmaceutical and biotechnology, food and non-aqueous types of application. This review will comprehensively look at the recent advances in NF membranes research. Significant development has taken place in terms of the fundamental understanding of the transport mechanism in NF membranes. This has been translated into predictive modeling based on the modified extended Nernst\u2013Planck equation. Similarly various methods have been used to fabricate improved NF membranes especially through interfacial polymerization incorporating nanoparticles and other additives, UV grafting/photografting, electron beam irradiation, plasma treatment and layer-by-layer modification. New applications were also explored in many industries. However fouling is still a prevalent issue that may hinder successful application of NF membranes. Efforts towards NF fouling prevention and mitigation have also been reported. The review ends with several recommendations on the future prospect of NF membranes research and development.", "An operational and economic study of a reverse osmosis desalination system for potable water and land irrigation ": "Desalination is a method for producing water for human consumption, irrigation or industrial utilisation. In this study, a reverse osmosis (RO) system for brackish water desalination was theoretically investigated to produce both potable drinking and agricultural water with a lower overall and specific energy consumption. As a case study, the Main Outfall Drain in Iraq is used as the brackish water source. A numerical model based on solution-diffusion theory was developed in Matlab Simulink and used to analyse the design and performance of an RO system. The effect of feed water temperature, pressure, salinity and recovery ratio on the efficiency of the whole RO system was investigated for a wide range of design considerations. The design of an RO system for this application was optimised and economic assessment carried out. Results show that with boosting recovery ratio from 30% to 60%, the specific energy of desalinated water production below 400ppm was reduced from 2.8kWh/m3 to a more economically favourable value of 0.8kWh/m3, when utilizing a pressure exchanger as a recovery device. Salt rejection was reduced from 97% to 88% to obtain large quantities of water for irrigation with an acceptable salinity (<1600ppm), for agricultural use. The reduction in salt rejection is influenced by the feed water temperature and pressure; also the average pore diameter of the RO membrane and in turn determines the reduction in system energy consumption. It was found that the total cost to produce 24,000m3/d of water from a feed salinity of 15,000ppm and a water quality of <400ppm would be 0.11\u00a3/m3 with a corresponding investment cost of \u00a314.4million for the drinking water, and for irrigation) obtained product <1600ppm) are \u00a30.9/m3 and \u00a311.3million.", "Experimental investigation of multistage electrodialysis for seawater desalination ": "Electrodialysis (ED) is currently used for selective removal of ions and brackish water desalination, while for seawater desalination ED is considered to be too energy intensive. This research focuses on the viability of ED using multiple stages for seawater desalination. With staging, the driving force is adapted to the governing conditions at that specific stage, operating at its individual optimum at lower energy consumption. An ED multistage configuration is examined that contains up to four stages. We compare single stage with multistage ED and investigate the effect of operation parameters. Different current densities are applied and optimized and residence time is compared to describe both transmembrane salt and water fluxes. We showed that desalination from 500\u202fmM to 200\u202fmM is possible, but that for these desalination conditions a multistage and single-stage system perform equal. Operation of each stage of the multistage close to limiting current density shows that desalination of synthetic seawater close to drinking water quality is possible. To reach this, the energy consumption is 3.6 kWh/m3 and at least 4 stages are needed. Although outlet concentrations between ED and RO are different, this non-optimized ED system showed double the energy consumption of the state-of-the-art desalination technology RO.", "Membrane technology enhancement in oil\u2013water separation. A review ": "Membrane separation processes have become an emerging technology for the treatment of oily wastewater due to high oil removal efficiency and relatively facile operational process. This review will highlight the recent development of advanced membrane technology such as surface modification, addition of inorganic particles in polymer membrane and the development of ceramic membranes. Additionally, the effect of operating parameters on the membrane performance is discussed in detail.

The driving force in the MD process is the vapour pressure difference induced by the temperature difference across the hydrophobic membrane. This process has various applications, such as desalination, wastewater treatment and in the food industry.\n                  This review addresses membrane characteristics, membrane-related heat and mass transfer concepts, fouling and the effects of operating condition. State of the art research results in these different areas will be presented and discussed.", "Solar powered desalination \u2013 Technology, energy and future outlook ": "Growing water demands have led to rapidly increasing desalination installation capacity worldwide. In an attempt to lower carbon footprint resulting from high-energy consuming desalination processes, attention has shifted to using renewable energy sources to power desalination. With solar irradiation ample in regions that heavily rely on desalination, solar powered desalination provides a sustainable solution to meeting water needs. The compatibility of each desalination process with the solar technology is driven by whether the kind of energy needed is thermal or electrical, as well as its availability. With rapid advances in solar energy technologies \u2013 both photovoltaic and solar thermal, there has also been growing interest in coupling solar energy with desalination, with a focus on improving energy efficiency. In this review, the most recent developments in photovoltaic powered reverse osmosis (PV-RO), solar thermal powered reverse osmosis (ST-RO) are discussed with respect to membrane materials, process configuration, energy recovery devices and energy storage. In addition, advances in new materials for solar powered membrane distillation (MD) and solar stills in the past two years have also been reviewed. Future outlook considers the use of hybrid renewable energy systems as well as solar powered forward osmosis and dewvaporation. Solar powered desalination systems have been analysed with emphasis on technological and energy consumption aspects.", "A review on electrospinning for membrane fabrication: Challenges and applications ": "Fibrous structures with nanoscale diameters offer a multitude of fascinating features, such as excellent mechanical behavior and large surface area to volume ratio, making them attractive for many applications. Their large surface area also gives them high functionalization ability. Among the many techniques available for generating nanofibers, electrospinning is rapidly emerging as a simple process in which careful control of operating conditions and polymer solution properties enables the production of highly porous structures of smooth non-woven nanofibers. Compared to traditional phase inversion techniques for membrane fabrication, electrospinning allows the formation of interconnected pores with uniform pore size and porosities exceeding 90%. As a result, electrospun membranes are increasingly being applied to many water purification applications such as membrane distillation and pretreatment of feed prior to reverse osmosis or nanofiltration processes by the removal of divalent metal ions, grease and other contaminants. Although the use of electrospinning for membrane fabrication has previously been reviewed, the rapid increase in developments over recent years has necessitated the need for a review on the preparation and application of electrospun nanofiber membranes as the barrier layer for water treatment, with emphasis on the reinforcement and post-treatment of electrospun polymer membranes.", "New generation nanomaterials for water desalination: A review ": "This paper intends to review the state of the art of new generation nanomaterials \u2013 carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, zeolites, aquaporin (AQP) for water desalination. The major applications of these nanomaterials in water desalination are critically discussed based on their functions in different types of processes. In addition, the potential impact of these nanomaterials on human health and ecosystem as well as its potential interference with treatment processes was also briefly discussed. It can be seen that the use of these advanced materials in membranes for reverse osmosis, membrane distillation, forward osmosis, pervaporation, and electrodialysis, formed the bulk of the reported works in the literature. Apart from that, these nanomaterials also have been reported to be utilized as adsorbents, supercapacitor, and capacitive deionization (CDI) for desalination purpose. However there has been very limited works reported on the environmental impact of these nanomaterials. Future works should focus on the process that would have the best potential to be cost-effectively commercialized at industrial scale which, based on this review, looks to be the CDI technology.", "Brine utilisation for cooling and salt production in wind-driven seawater greenhouses: Design and modelling ": "Brine disposal is a major challenge facing the desalination industry. Discharged brines pollute the oceans and aquifers. Here is it proposed to reduce the volume of brines by means of evaporative coolers in seawater greenhouses, thus enabling the cultivation of high-value crops and production of sea salt. Unlike in typical greenhouses, only natural wind is used for ventilation, without electric fans. We present a model to predict the water evaporation, salt production, internal temperature and humidity according to ambient conditions. Predictions are presented for three case studies: (a) the Horn of Africa (Berbera) where a seawater desalination plant will be coupled to salt production; (b) Iran (Ahwaz) for management of hypersaline water from the Gotvand dam; (c) Gujarat (Ahmedabad) where natural seawater is fed to the cooling process, enhancing salt production in solar salt works. Water evaporation per face area of evaporator pad is predicted in the range 33 to 83m3/m2\u00b7yr, and salt production up to 5.8tonnes/m2\u00b7yr. Temperature is lowest close to the evaporator pad, increasing downwind, such that the cooling effect mostly dissipates within 15m of the cooling pad. Depending on location, peak temperatures reduce by 8\u201316\u00b0C at the hottest time of year.", "Freshwater production from the motion of ocean waves \u2013 A review ": "Freshwater scarcity and insufficient sanitation are global urgent problems, affecting billions of people. In this review paper, the process of desalination powered by wave power has been investigated as a potential sustainable solution to water shortage. The different desalination techniques suitable for this type of combined system, i.e. reverse osmosis, electrodialysis and mechanical vapor compression, have been outlined, as well as the different wave energy converters possible to power the desalination process, i.e. oscillating water columns, oscillating bodies (wave activated bodies) and overtopping systems. Some necessary considerations for this type of project are identified. The different wave power/desalination projects and how they have proceeded are presented. The most common design of a wave energy and desalination system includes a wave activated body to pressurize seawater; the seawater flows through a reverse osmosis membrane, resulting in freshwater. Some successful (freshwater producing) wave energy/desalination projects were identified: Delbuoy, the oscillating water column in Vizhinjam, CETO Freshwater, SAROS and Odyss\u00e9e. It is concluded that wave power and desalination can be combined in a sustainable and autonomous system, generating freshwater from the ocean waves. However, questions regarding cost of produced water, variations in power production due to intermittency and environmental effects still remain.", "Electrocoagulation process in water treatment: A review of electrocoagulation modeling approaches ": "Electrocoagulation process (EC) has been the subject of several reviews in the last decade, and is still a very active area of research. Most published works deals with applications for treatment of drinking water and urban, industrial or agricultural wastewaters so as to enhance the simultaneous abatement of soluble and colloidal pollution. These also include contributions to theoretical understanding, electrode materials, operating conditions, reactor design and even techno-economic analysis. Even though, the numerous advantages reported in the literature, and the pros and cons of EC in comparison to alternative processes, its industrial application is not yet considered as an established wastewater technology because of the lack of systematic models for reactor scale-up. This paper presents a comprehensive review on its development and design. The most recent advances on EC reactor modeling are summarized with special emphasis on four major issues that still constitute the cornerstone of EC: the theoretical understanding of mechanisms governing pollution abatement, modeling approaches, CFD simulations, and techno-economic optimization. Finally, outlooks for future research and developments are suggested.", "Timeline on the application of intercalation materials in Capacitive Deionization ": "Capacitive deionization is a water desalination technology in which ions are stored in electrodes in an electrochemical cell construction, connected to an external circuit, to remove ions present in water from various sources. Conventionally, carbon has been the choice of material for the electrodes due to its low cost, low contact resistance and high specific surface area, electronic conductivity, and ion mobility within pores. The ions in the water are stored at the pore walls of these electrodes in an electrical double layer. However, alternative electrode materials, with a different mechanism for ion and charge storage, referred to as ion intercalation, have been fabricated and studied as well. The salt adsorption performance exhibited by these materials is in most cases higher than that of carbon electrodes. This work traces the evolution of the study of redox activity in these intercalation materials and provides a chronological description of major developments in the field of Capacitive Deionization (CDI) with intercalation electrodes. In addition, some insights into the cell architecture and operation parameters are provided and we present our outlook of future developments in the field of intercalation materials for CDI.", "Selection of pretreatment technologies for seawater reverse osmosis plants: A review ": "Seawater desalination using reverse osmosis (RO) process has increased substantially in the recent past and is expected to grow at an increasingly rapid pace in the future. Successful operation of a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant depends on the ability of the pretreatment system to consistently produce adequately treated filtered water for the subsequent RO process. Both conventional (e.g., conventional/lamella sedimentation, dissolved air flotation, granular media gravity/pressure filtration) and membrane-based pretreatment processes (e.g., microfiltration, ultrafiltration) have found practical application worldwide. Although most of the currently operational pretreatment systems are conventional, low-pressure membrane based pretreatment systems are increasingly being considered for future plants. Thus, selection of conventional versus membrane based pretreatment is increasingly becoming difficult. Both water quality perspectives and non-water quality based criteria (ease of operation, facility footprint, construction costs, operating costs, economy of scale, design specifications, contractual agreements, etc.) need to be critically reviewed to make a prudent decision. This paper provides a critical review of both conventional and membrane-based pretreatment technologies by presenting water quality issues impacting their performances, critical design characteristics and their impacts on pretreatment selection, non-water quality based selection criteria, and a conceptual decision matrix for selection of pretreatment technologies for site specific conditions.", "Reverse osmosis pretreatment technologies and future trends: A comprehensive review ": "Recent progress in reverse osmosis (RO) technology is not limited to RO membrane materials, module designs and RO process optimization. It involves prior feed treatment which directly impacts RO system performance. The ongoing challenges of membrane fouling in RO membranes can be addressed by increasing the operational efficiency through the use of correct pretreatment options which can mitigate organic and inorganic fouling by selectively rejecting contaminants prior to reaching the RO unit.\n                  Highly polluted water resources have put critical stress on the existing conventional pretreatment techniques, whereby membrane pretreatment has emerged as a promising alternative. This paper provides an overview of the development and current trends in conventional and non-conventional RO pretreatment techniques whereby the techniques are critically reviewed to inform readers of potential improvements in such areas. This paper addresses the major drawbacks of conventional pretreatment methods which have necessitated the use of membrane pretreatment techniques. Special attention is given to microfiltration, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration methods and their development in terms of advanced membrane materials based on ceramics and self-cleaning membranes. Studies from laboratory scale standalone systems, pilot scale and large scale integrated systems for performance, cost and ecological analysis have been reviewed to familiarize readers with the many factors which need to be analyzed for selection of the appropriate pretreatment method(s). The critical review in this paper will help researchers focus more on the areas which have room for further development for cost-effective and advanced RO pretreatment techniques.", "Technical review and evaluation of the economics of water desalination: Current and future challenges for better water supply sustainability ": "Desalination capacity has rapidly increased in the last decade because of the increase in water demand and a significant reduction in desalination cost as a result of significant technological advances, especially in the reverse osmosis process. The cost of desalinated seawater has fallen below US$0.50/m3 for a large scale seawater reverse osmosis plant at a specific location and conditions while in other locations the cost is 50% higher (US$1.00/m3) for a similar facility. In addition to capital and operating costs, other parameters such as local incentives or subsidies may also contribute to the large difference in desalted water cost between regions and facilities. Plant suppliers and consultants have their own cost calculation methodologies, but they are confidential and provide water costs with different accuracies. The few existing costing methodologies and software packages such as WTCost\u00a9 and DEEP provide an estimated cost with different accuracies and their applications are limited to specific conditions. Most of the available cost estimation tools are of the black box type, which provide few details concerning the parameters and methodologies applied for local conditions. Many desalination plants built recently have greater desalinated water delivery costs caused by special circumstances, such as plant remediation or upgrades, local variation in energy costs, and site-specific issues in raw materials costs (e.g., tariffs and transportation). Therefore, the availability of a more transparent and unique methodology for estimating the cost will help in selecting an appropriate desalination technology suitable for specific locations with consideration of all the parameters influencing the cost. A techno-economic evaluation and review of the costing aspects and the main parameters influencing the total water cost produced by different desalination technologies are herein presented in detail. Some recent developments, such as the increase of unit capacity, improvements in process design and materials, and the use of hybrid systems have contributed to cost reduction as well as reduction in energy consumption. The development of new and emerging low-energy desalination technologies, such as adsorption desalination, will have an impact on cost variation estimation in the future.", "A review on membrane fabrication: Structure, properties and performance relationship ": "In this review, polymeric membrane fabrication techniques for pressure driven membrane processes and membrane distillation are discussed. The fabrication technique, properties of the fabricated membranes and performance in water desalination are related. Important parameters which affect the membrane performance such as crystallinity of the membrane based polymer, porous structure, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, membrane charge and surface roughness are analyzed. Despite the fact that extensive knowledge exist on how to \u2018tailor\u2019 membrane pore structure including its surface properties and cross-section morphology by selection of appropriate fabrication methods, there is still a challenge to produce reliable membranes with anti-fouling properties, chemical resistance, high mechanical strength with high flux and selectivity. To ensure progress in membrane performance, further improvements are needed of common membrane fabrication techniques such as phase inversion and interfacial polymerization. At the same time, the potential of novel fabrication techniques such as electrospinning and track-etching needs to be assessed. A comprehensive understanding between structure-surface properties and performance is a key for further development and progress in membrane technology for water desalination.", "Innovative lithium recovery technique from seawater by using world-first dialysis with a lithium ionic superconductor ": "Lithium (Li) procurement is becoming a matter of importance worldwide. Herein, I propose a method for recovering Li from seawater by using world-first dialysis, wherein Li only permeates from the negative electrode side to the positive electrode side through a Li ionic superconductor functioning as a Li separation membrane (LISM). Measurements of the Li ion concentration at the positive electrode side as a function of dialysis duration showed that the Li recovery ratio increased to approximately 7% after 72h with no applied electric voltage. Moreover, other ions in the seawater did not permeate the LISM. With both ends of the LISM bound with a negative and positive electrode, hydrated Li ion was transformed to Li ion only because Li ion can permeate through the LISM. This new recovery method shows good energy efficiency and is easily scalable and is thus suitable for the industrialised mass production of Li in South American countries, which have briny water containing Li.", "Comparison of energy consumption in desalination by capacitive deionization and reverse osmosis ": "Capacitive deionization (CDI), which is based on the electrosorption of ions by porous electrodes, is an emerging technology for brackish water desalination. Understanding the key drivers of energy consumption in CDI and benchmarking CDI with reverse osmosis (RO), the current state-of-the-art for brackish and seawater desalination, is crucial to guide the future development of desalination technologies. In this study, we develop system-scale models to analyze the energy consumption and energy efficiency of CDI and RO over a wide range of material properties and operating conditions. Using our models, we explore how the energetic performance of CDI and RO compare as a function of feed salinity, water recovery, salt rejection, and average water flux, which is normalized by electrode and membrane area in CDI and RO, respectively. Our analysis shows that RO is significantly more energy efficient than CDI, particularly when targeting higher salinity feed streams and higher salt rejection values. For brackish water with a salt concentration of 2000\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121, achieving 50% water recovery and 75% salt rejection, with an average water flux of 10\u202fL\u202fm\u22122\u202fh\u22121 using CDI requires a specific energy consumption of 0.85\u202fkWh\u202fm\u22123, more than eight times that of RO (0.09\u202fkWh\u202fm\u22123). Importantly, our results also indicate that current efforts to improve electrode materials can only marginally reduce the energy consumption of CDI. We conclude with a discussion highlighting other important factors, such as capital cost, electrode stability, and membrane fouling, which affect the efficacy of CDI and RO for low-salinity desalination.", "Scaling after remineralisation of reverse osmosis permeate ": "Scaling problems are more frequently observed in hot water equipment fed with remineralised reverse osmosis permeate compared to hot water systems fed with conventionally purified water. These problems occur when permeate from reserve osmosis is remineralised to a hardness to meet the regulations. The effects of temperature, initial calcium concentration, and the addition of two types of scaling inhibitors (humic substances and phosphate) on scaling formation were investigated using synthetic water to mimic remineralised RO permeate and tap water. No scaling was observed at room temperature for solutions with an initial concentration of about 40\u201360\u202fmg/L Ca2+. At higher temperature, the saturation index increased, and scaling occurred. In conventional hot tap water, scaling occurred after prolonged exposure time but was about 50% less compared to synthetic water, probably due to the presence of scaling retarding compounds in the tap water such as humic substances. In hot synthetic water, scaling was also retarded when humic substances were dosed. Humic substances at its optimum dosage (3\u202fmg/L C) was more efficient for inhibition of scaling than phosphate at its optimum dosage (1\u202fmg/L P).", "Membrane-based seawater desalination: Present and future prospects ": "Given increasing regional water scarcity and that almost half of the world's population lives within 100km of an ocean, seawater represents a virtually infinite water resource. However, its exploitation is presently limited by the significant specific energy consumption (kWh/m3) required by conventional desalination technologies, further exasperated by high unit costs ($/m3) and environmental impacts including GHG emissions (g CO2-eq/m3), organism impingement/entrainment through intakes, and brine disposal through outfalls. This paper explores the state-of-the-art in present seawater desalination practice, emphasizing membrane-based technologies, while identifying future opportunities in step improvements to conventional technologies and development of emerging, potentially disruptive, technologies through advances in material science, process engineering, and system integration. In this paper, seawater reverse osmosis (RO) serves as the baseline conventional technology. The discussion extends beyond desalting processes into membrane-based salinity gradient energy production processes, which can provide an energy offset to desalination process energy requirements. The future membrane landscape in membrane-based desalination and salinity gradient energy is projected to include ultrahigh permeability RO membranes, renewable-energy driven desalination, and emerging processes including closed-circuit RO, membrane distillation, forward osmosis, pressure retarded osmosis, and reverse electrodialysis according various niche applications and/or hybrids, operating separately or in conjunction with RO.", "The Effect of Vascular Segmentation Methods on Stereotactic Trajectory Planning for Drug-Resistant Focal Epilepsy: A Retrospective Cohort Study ": "Background\n                  Stereotactic neurosurgical procedures carry a risk of intracranial hemorrhage, which may result in significant morbidity and mortality. Vascular imaging is crucial for planning stereotactic procedures to prevent conflicts with intracranial vasculature. There is a wide range\u00a0of vascular imaging methods used for stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) trajectory planning. Computer-assisted planning (CAP) improves planning time and trajectory metrics. We aimed to quantify the effect of different vascular imaging protocols on CAP trajectories for SEEG.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Ten patients who had undergone SEEG (95 electrodes) following preoperative acquisition of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MR\u00a0+ Gad), magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRV\u00a0+ MRA), and digital subtraction catheter angiography (DSA) were identified from a prospectively maintained database. SEEG implantations were planned using CAP using DSA segmentations as the gold standard. Strategies were then recreated using MRV\u00a0+ MRA and MR\u00a0+ Gad to define the \u201capparent\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d risk scores associated with each modality. Vessels of varying diameter were then iteratively removed from the DSA segmentation to identify the size at which all 3 vascular modalities returned the same safety metrics.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  CAP performed using DSA vessel segmentations resulted in significantly lower \u201ctrue\u201d risk scores and greater minimum distances from vasculature compared with the \u201ctrue\u201d risk associated with MR\u00a0+ Gad and MRV\u00a0+ MRA. MRV\u00a0+ MRA and MR\u00a0+ Gad returned similar risk scores to DSA when vessels <2 mm and <4 mm were not considered, respectively.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Significant variability in vascular imaging and trajectory planning practices exist for SEEG. CAP performed with MR\u00a0+ Gad or MRV\u00a0+ MRA alone returns \u201cfalsely\u201d lower risk scores compared with DSA. It is unclear whether DSA is oversensitive and thus restricting potential trajectories.", "Decreased Value of Highly Accurate Fractional Anisotropy Using 3-Tesla ZOOM Diffusion Tensor Imaging After Decompressive Surgery in Patients with Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy: Aligned Fibers Effect ": "Background\n                  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used; however, most of the prior studies have resulted in presurgical decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). We used ZOOM DTI and could acquire highly accurate FA values during perioperative periods, which indicated different insights than preceding studies. The objective of this study was to assess the perioperative FA change in patients with CSM and determine the prognostic factor.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Twenty-eight patients with CSM and healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. Twenty patients (71%) had intracordal high intensity before surgery. All patients underwent decompressive surgery. ZOOM DTI and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) assessment were performed before and after surgery. The region of interest was manually contoured to omit the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid. The axial plane of the most stenotic cervical level was assessed.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  FA values before surgery and at 1 week after surgery, and FA values at 1 week after surgery and at 6 months after surgery differed significantly as determined. The FA values of patients with intracordal high intensity significantly decreased after surgery and significantly increased from 1 week to 6 months, whereas those of patients without intracordal high intensity did not significantly change. JOA scores at 6 months after surgery (13.1) improved significantly compared with JOA scores before surgery (10.8). Only FA values at 1 week after surgery had a significant positive relationship with JOA scores presurgery and at 6 months after surgery.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The presurgical FA value in patients with CSM did not differ from that of normal control subjects, but significantly decreased after surgery, and significantly increased 6 months after surgery. We concluded that the postsurgical FA value approximates the proper state of the damaged cord and the presurgical FA value includes a masked effect as an aligned fiber effect because of compression by degenerative construction. Only the FA value at 1 week had a significant positive relationship with the JOA score presugery and at 6 months, which established that the postsurgical FA value may be a more accurate prognostic factor than the presurgical FA value.", "Late-Onset Intractable Cerebrospinal Fluid Leakage After Stereotactic Radiotherapy After Resection of Giant Nonfunctioning Pituitary Adenoma ": "Background\n                  Late-onset skull base cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a very rare complication.\n               \n               \n                  Case Description\n                  A 54-year-old woman came to our department for convulsions and was admitted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant tumor in the skull base region, including the sphenoid sinus, pituitary fossa, right cavernous sinus, right middle fossa, and right basal ganglia. Mild left hemiparesis was noted. An ophthalmologic examination revealed left side homonymous hemianopsia. Using an endonasal endoscopic surgical approach, tumor removal was performed, with the residual tumor removed with a transcranial approach. Residual tumor tissue remained around the right cavernous sinus; therefore, SRT was performed 1 month after the second procedure, which resulted in good control of growth. Four years later, spontaneous CSF leakage occurred, for which endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed. One month later, CSF leakage recurred, and the same procedure was again used. A third episode of recurrent CSF leakage occurred 5 days later. A transcranial approach was finally used for repair, and the patient showed complete recovery.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Late-onset CSF leakage after SRT for a pituitary adenoma can be intractable, and several aggressive repair procedures may be needed, including a combination of endonasal and transcranial approaches.", "Ice-penetrating radar survey of the subsurface debris field at Camp Century, Greenland ": "The warming climate is changing the surface dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet, including the balance between snowfall and melt. Increasing surface melt impacts the structure of the relatively porous near-surface layer known as firn. Camp Century, a base abandoned in 1967, now comprises a subsurface debris field within the firn in Northwest Greenland. We collected 80\u202fkm of 100 or 250\u202fMHz radar data in nested grids over this subsurface debris field. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of this ice-penetrating radar survey. The vast majority (95%) of subsurface reflectors are located at depths of greater than 32\u202fm. The tunnel network, as well as an overlying layer associated with historical surface activities, is readily visible in the radar data. This subsurface debris field is approximately circular with a radius of less than 1\u202fkm. Local downwarping of clear internal layers \u2013 likely annual accumulation layers - identifies now-collapsed liquid sumps. Analysis of radar signal polarity suggests that liquid hydrocarbons are likely present in one of these sumps. The radar data and a geo-referenced site map of Camp Century are freely accessible at www.campcenturyclimate.dk.", "Anti-icing and de-icing techniques for wind turbines: Critical review ": "Precipitation, atmospheric and in-cloud icing affect wind turbine operation in various ways, including measurement and control errors, power losses, mechanical and electrical failures and safety hazard. Anti-icing and de-icing strategies are used to minimize these effects. Many active and passive methods are in development but few are available on the market. Active heating of blades is the most tested, used and reliable way to prevent icing effects. It is used in parallel with passive hydrophobic coating to lower energy consumption. Precise icing evaluation of the site should be done during the assessment phase to evaluate the necessity and benefits of installing an anti-icing and/or a de-icing system. This evaluation shall continue during operation in order to optimize production and avoid component failure related to icing events. Multiple anemometry in combination with relative humidity measurements is a cheap and reliable icing detection method during assessment while the use of ice sensors and the power curve method is recommended during operation.", "A creep model for frozen sand of Qinghai-Tibet based on Nishihara model ": "The tri-axial creep tests of frozen sand with different dry densities and grain size distributions were performed at 0.1\u202fMPa confining pressure at different temperatures. The results show that the rheological properties of frozen sand are significantly affected by the temperature, the creep deformation of the frozen sand is obvious even under a small load when the temperature is higher than - 1.5\u202f\u00b0C. Firstly, based on the Nishihara model, the elastic modulus of viscoelastic elements is modified to be a function of stress, the coefficient of viscosity in viscoelastic part is modified considering the effect of time and stress, and the viscoplastic element is improved by introducing the damage variable. Then a new non-linear creep constitutive model for frozen sand is proposed, and the new model is verified based on test results. It can be found that the predicted results agree well with the corresponding experimental results from low stress to high stress, and the proposed model can describe the whole creep process of frozen sand with different dry densities and grain size distributions accurately under different shear stress levels and temperatures. Besides, the function relationship between the model parameters and the shear stress under different temperatures is obtained through the regression analysis. Finally, the influences of the temperature and shear stress on the parameters are analyzed as well. This study is important to further study the stability of permafrost subgrade, and can accumulate experimental data for the study of creep theory.", "Computational fluid dynamics simulation of snowdrift around buildings: Past achievements and future perspectives ": "This paper reviews the current status of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of snowdrift around buildings and discusses the review findings to give insight into future applications. First, an overview of past achievements in CFD simulations of snowdrift around buildings is provided by reviewing previous research. The history of model development is briefly outlined. Next, recent application examples are presented with respect to several topics, i.e., the application to practical design, consideration of meteorological influences and prediction of roof snow. Finally, the remaining development issues and new challenges are presented from an engineering viewpoint. Necessities of further model development, validation database, best practical guidelines and advanced analysis using CFD results are demonstrated. Clearly, CFD has considerable potential, as established in this review. However, to use it appropriately, sufficient attention should be paid to modeling theory and implementation. Because snowdrift is a highly complex phenomenon, we should not excessively rely on numerical simulation. It is important to use data from actual phenomena for all aspects of study.", "In-situ icing and water condensation study on different topographical surfaces ": "Icephobicity is intrinsically affected by rough asperities and the surface voids provide anchoring points for the ice. The anchor of ice is likely to form on the surface under high humidity conditions. In-situ water condensation and icing observation were conducted to understand water condensation and ice retracting patterns in controlled humidity, pressure and temperature conditions. It was observed that water micro-condensation and icing occurred on rougher surfaces and the water droplets condensed along the surface cracks of the superhydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based nanocomposite coatings. Further analysis revealed that ice anchoring was present on both aluminum and superhydrophobic coating surface, but it was more severe and intensified on the as-received aluminum substrates. No water condensation or subsequent icing was found on smooth PDMS hydrophobic surfaces due to the incapacity of the smooth surfaces to anchor water drops. It is the first time to validate ice anchoring over retracting ice on different wettability surfaces from in-situ icing observation. Ice adhesion strengths were also measured on the studied surfaces and the results indicated a strong linkage between centrifugal shearing of ice and anchoring mechanism due to surface rough voids, and there was no clear relevancy between ice adhesion strength and the surface wettability or hydrophobicity.", "Assessing frost susceptibility of soils using PCHeave ": "This paper first presents a simple frost heave model. Frost heave is assumed to be caused by the formation of ice lenses in a freezing soil. The formation of ice lenses is governed by the Clapeyron equation of thermodynamics and relies on the existence of a frozen fringe between the frozen and unfrozen zones. Both unfrozen water and ice co-exist in pores of the frozen fringe. The suction at the water\u2013ice interface is the driving force for the water flow that feeds the growth of the ice lens. The initiation of a new ice lens is governed by a simple effective stress concept. The frost heave model contains only a few soil parameters and can be used to compute frost heave and frost penetration in stratified soil profiles. The second part of the paper illustrates the application of the frost heave model in assessing the frost susceptibility of different soils. It is shown that the frost susceptibility of a soil must be assessed together with environmental conditions such as overburden pressure, temperature gradient, cooling rate and the depth of groundwater table. A soil that is only mildly susceptible to frost according to classification can still generate a significant amount of heave or heaving pressure under favourable environmental conditions.", "Understanding the effect of superhydrophobic coatings on energy reduction in anti-icing systems ": "In the development of anti/de-icing systems for aeronautics, wind turbines or telecommunication antennas to date, less attention is paid to coating strategies. The majority of studies dealing with coatings have focused mainly on reducing ice adhesion forces, to easily remove ice, once it has formed. In this study we focused on an alternative strategy that consists of promoting the shedding of liquid water as a way to reduce the total amount of water present on the surface that can freeze. Shedding of liquid from the surface can be enhanced by modification of surface wettability, by means of the application of superhydrophobic coatings, i.e. water repellent coatings, characterized by low water adhesion forces.\n                  To study the effect of superhydrophobic coatings on surfaces exposed to icing conditions, tests were performed in an open loop icing wind tunnel (IWT) on a standard NACA0021 airfoil in two different icing conditions. Three samples were used during the tests, each one is characterized by different wettability properties. To simulate the presence on anti/de-icing system, the wing was also equipped with an electrical heater, mounted at the inner side of the wing leading edge.\n                  Results from IWT tests demonstrated that surface wettability is an important controlling factor not only for reducing ice accretion on the wing, but also for reducing by up to 80% the energy required to avoid ice accretion on the wing. The findings from IWT tests as described, together with results from a previous work on drop shedding, reinforced the hypothesis that shedding of drops is the key controlling mechanism for an efficient icing mitigation strategy.", "Analysis and modelling of icing of air intake protection grids of aircraft engines ": "Icing represents a major problem in the aviation industry. While icing of aerodynamic surfaces such as airfoils due to the impingement of supercooled liquid water droplets is widely studied, even if not yet fully understood, icing of supporting structures like protection grids of engine air intakes has been investigated to a lesser extent. An optimization of the design of the grids will help to reduce icing severity and delaying or avoiding loss of efficiency that could lead to hazardous situations.\n                  The present study investigates the icing behaviour of stainless steel protection grids in use on rotorcraft and turboprop engines. New experimental and analytical tools were developed to enable a quantitative study of grid icing under representative icing conditions in a lab-scale icing wind tunnel. The variation of the most relevant parameters like liquid water content of the cloud, airspeed, ambient temperature and mesh size of the grid allowed the identification of their influence on the icing behaviour. Further analysis of the experimental data led to the development and validation of a general physical model for ice accretion on grid structures.", "Modelling present and future permafrost thermal regimes in Northeast Greenland ": "Permafrost is vulnerable to rapid changes in climate, and increasing air temperatures have recently resulted in the increase of active layer thickness, thaw subsidence and warming of the underlying permafrost. Such changes have important implications for geotechnical properties and the stability of infrastructures in permafrost-affected areas. Many studies focus on the sensitivity of the active layer with respect to changes in climate conditions, but few assess the sensitivity of active layer thermal properties in relation to sediment types and soil water contents, and the importance of direct measurements of thermal property sensitivity with respect to soil water content compared to default physical relationships incorporated in process-based models. In this study, we use on-site data and samples to measure thermal conductivity (TC) at different gravimetric water/ice contents (GWC) in frozen and thawed permafrost. The samples, obtained from an emerged delta and an alluvial fan in the Zackenberg Valley, NE Greenland, are characterized by contrasting grain-size distribution and mineralogy. We calibrated a coupled heat and water transfer model, the \u201cCoupModel\u201d, to simulate permafrost temperatures at two sites on the delta. The sites have different snow depth characteristics and were simulated using both observed and default values of TC, and observed liquid soil water content. The results show that depth- and sediment type-specific TC values are crucial for a successful model simulation, and that transfer function derived values of TC are useful for modeling permafrost temperatures as long as site- and depth-specific grain size distribution and ice contents are defined. A thicker snow pack increased ground surface temperatures and resulted in a 1\u00b0C higher annual mean ground temperature at the depth of zero annual amplitude. Permafrost temperatures increased by 1.5\u00b0C and 3.5\u00b0C at the depth of 18m with 3\u00b0C and 6\u00b0C ground surface warming, but warming combined with increased soil water content had no important additional effect on the thermal regime when ground surface temperatures were prescribed as upper boundary conditions. Precipitation in the form of snow, however, may have a larger effect on ground temperatures directly, due to the surface temperature changes, than will the subsequent changes in thermal properties following increase in soil water content.", "Finding safe and efficient shipping routes in ice-covered waters: A framework and a model ": "Safety for conventional and autonomous navigation in ice-covered waters is a topic of rising importance. Here, we propose a generic extendable framework to provide the optimal route from multiple route planning objectives. These objectives are attained by an evaluation of multi-source input data, including state-of-the-art model data for ice conditions, for bathymetric knowledge, and for ship-ice interaction. Additionally, we model the ship-ship interactions statistically using a mean-field, to account for ships (indirectly) assisting each other via artificial ice channels. For the subsequent pathfinding problem, we propose a new A*-based algorithm that yields output which is not dependent on the grid format of the input data but instead consists of a path that follows the Earth's curvature. The outputs of the algorithm are a set of waypoints (representing the optimal route), the travel costs (expressed in time), and the additional travel cost estimates caused by route deviation, should the optimal route be altered in any way. The steaming speeds, the optimal route, and the deviation times are represented with two-dimensional (2D) maps. Finally, we provide a model implementation of our framework as a Matlab-package, ICEPATHFINDER, that is suitable for both operational and strategic ship route optimization.", "Review of the state of the art: interactions between a buried pipeline and frozen soil ": "The buckling behaviour of a buried pipeline caused by frost heave and thaw settlement is the main reason for deformation of the onshore pipelines in cold regions. The interaction between the buried pipeline and frozen soil can be a dynamic and complex interaction process. The physical mechanism of the interaction processes for the design of onshore pipelines in cold regions is of great importance. With the construction of the Trans-Alaska (Alyeska) Pipeline System (TAPS), Norman Wells Oil Pipeline (NWOP), Golmud-Lhasa Oil Pipeline (GLOP) and China-Russia Crude Oil Pipeline (CRCOP), the deformation behaviours of buried pipelines and the mechanical behaviours of frozen soils have been investigated, and numerous research results have been obtained. This paper summarizes the developments of the buried pipelines and analyses the technical developments regarding the design, construction and operation of buried pipelines in cold regions. This summary will facilitate the convenient application of pipelines in cold regions, and there is significant room for improvement and new research to improve the pipe-soil interactions in cold regions.", "Shear strength and damage mechanism of saline intact loess after freeze-thaw cycling ": "Salt accumulation in the surface of soil mass and the structural damage during freeze-thaw cycling are a critical cause for the collapse of loess slopes in northwestern China. A simple method is proposed for preparing intact specimens containing soluble salt, called the leaching method, by which salt infiltrated can be uniformly distributed with the disturbance to the soil structure minimized. Verifications prove that the prepared specimens exhibit evenly distributed water and sodium sulfate. Triaxial shear test results show that the cohesion of specimens decreases after freeze-thaw, and the reduction mainly occurs after 1 to 2\u202fcycles. Specimens with more water or sodium sulfate also manifest lower cohesion. Two characteristic indexes including crack ratio and fractal dimension that quantifies the apparent cracks of specimens indicate that more pronounced cracks appear at higher salt contents. This trend is intensified after more freeze-thaw cycles. The cohesion-based damage coefficients are calculated based on a specific damage path considering both freeze-thaw and salt erosion. The damage coefficient of freeze-thaw decreases at higher salt contents while salt erosion accounts for a major part to the total damage at contents higher than 1.0%. The ratio of freeze-thaw damage coefficient to that by salt erosion decays with freeze-thaw, especially in the initial five cycles, beyond which it stabilizes, like the attenuation of cohesion. The mesoscopic damage due to coupled effect of freeze-thaw and salt erosion is analyzed based on the computed tomography (CT). Results show that the mean CT value (ME) exhibit similar variations to the shear strength after freeze-thaw while the standard deviation (SD) value grows.", "Experimental study on the tensile strength and failure characteristics of transversely isotropic rocks after freeze-thaw cycles ": "Freeze-thaw (F-T) is a frequent occurrence in cold regions and can weaken the mechanical properties of rocks, thereby severely affecting the safety of rock engineering projects and even causing accidents. In this research, direct tensile tests were conducted to experimentally investigate the influence of the number of F-T\u202fcycles (i.e., 0, 10, 20, and 30 times) and the bedding orientation (i.e., 0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0, and 90\u00b0) on the tensile strength and failure pattern of transversely isotropic rocks. The results indicate that the tensile strength decreases with the increasing number of F-T cycles and continuously increases with the increasing bedding orientation. The degree of anisotropy in the tensile strength increases with the increasing number of F-T cycles because weakness planes are more sensitive to the effects of F-T cycling and show greater damage than the parent rock. The orientation of the failure plane of the specimens increases with the increasing bedding orientation until a certain orientation is reached, beyond which it decreases rapidly to nearly zero. In addition, a model for the prediction of the tensile strength and failure characteristics of transversely isotropic rocks after F-T cycles is presented based on Nova and Zaninetti's tensile failure theory, and a large quantity of experimental data were adopted for comparison with the theoretical results. It is determined that the proposed model can effectively describe the relationships among the tensile strength properties, bedding orientation, and number of F-T\u202fcycles.", "Volume changes and mechanical degradation of a compacted expansive soil under freeze-thaw cycles ": "Expansive soils located in permafrost and seasonal frozen regions can easily suffer from the action of frost heaving and repeated freezing\u2013thawing. When exposed to freeze\u2013thaw (F\u2013T) cycles, it may pose risk to civil engineering structures and thus causes heavy economic losses. In this study, a series of cylindrical expansive soil specimens were compacted at three different molding water contents (15%, 20% and 23%) and then subjected to a maximum of 12 closed\u2013system F\u2013T\u202fcycles. Besides, selected specimens compacted at the optimum water content were also tested under cyclic freezing\u2013thawing with varying freezing temperatures (\u22125\u202f\u00b0C, \u221210\u202f\u00b0C and \u221220\u202f\u00b0C). After each cycle of F\u2013T, volume changes were measured and unconfined compression testing was also performed to estimate stress\u2013strain behavior, resilient modulus and failure strength. Moreover, meso\u2013structural analysis was conducted by using a simple optical test system to quantitatively extract the surface porosity and the pore orientation degree of expansive soil specimens after different F\u2013T\u202fcycles. It is found that: 1) Volume changes for expansive soil specimens with higher and lower saturations present opposite directions and different magnitudes upon freezing, but show a similar trend of volume expansion after thawing. A moderate freezing temperature (i.e. \u201310\u202f\u00b0C, in this study) has the greatest effect on volume changes. 2) Expansive soils tend to exhibit strain\u2013softening behavior under unconfined compression conditions. The resilient modulus and failure strength decrease significantly at the first cycle of F\u2013T and then reduce gradually to a stable value with increasing F\u2013T\u202fcycles. The higher molding water content and a moderate freezing temperature will lead to a more pronounced degradation of mechanical behaviors with the F\u2013T\u202fcycles. 3) It is suggested from the meso\u2013structural analysis that the internal pores of expansive soils after a sequence of F\u2013T\u202fcycles tend to become larger and more uniform, especially for the soil with higher water contents or experienced at a moderate freezing temperature.", "Characteristics of the liquid and vapor migration of coarse-grained soil in an open-system under constant-temperature freezing ": "Liquid and vapor migration is the key factor in evaluating the frost heaving properties of coarse-grained soil (CGS) in the high-speed railway (HSR) subgrade in cold regions. A fluorescein tracer was applied to investigate the liquid and vapor migration characteristics of CGS during constant-temperature freezing tests. In addition, the effects of the initial water content on the liquid and vapor migration properties were studied in this paper. The results show that the vapor migration is the dominant factor that causes the water redistribution of CGS in the freezing process. The vapor migration exists both in the supply of the external water sources and internally in the CGS. Water mainly migrates upward in the form of vapor under the effect of a water content gradient and a temperature gradient. The amount of liquid and vapor coupling migration in CGS decreases with the increase in initial water content, followed by a lower amount of external water migration, particularly vapor migration, and a lower height of the upward migration of the liquid. Although the vapor migrates across the freezing front and continually moves upward, the degree of vapor migration will gradually decline with a certain impact time domain and zone.", "Dynamic properties of frozen silty soils with different coarse-grained contents subjected to cyclic triaxial loading ": "In cold seismic regions, the dynamic properties of frozen silty soils with different coarse-grained contents have great influence on the stability of core-wall dam in hydraulic engineering subjected to seismic/repeated loading. In order to investigate their dynamic behaviors, the materials were prepared with silty soils incorporating different percentages of coarse grains, and the mass ratios of coarse particles to silty soils for the samples are 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%, respectively. A series of cyclic triaxial compression tests at the temperature of \u22126\u00b0C were carried out with 1.0\u202fHz frequency by employing the modified MTS-810 apparatus with confining pressures ranging from 0.3 to 4.0\u202fMPa. Laboratory results demonstrate that the coarse-grained contents have great effect on the static and dynamic behaviors of frozen soil mixtures. With the increasing coarse-grained contents, the static strength first decreases to a smaller value and then increases slightly. When subjected to cyclic loading, the resilient modulus increases all the time, whereas the damping ratio presents conversely a decreasing tendency. As the loading cycles increase, the accumulative plastic strain presents an accelerating development at the virgin stage and then gradually approaches the failure strain, whose evolving rule can be well predicted by the modified Monismith model, and the rate of accumulative plastic strain descends first and then reaches a stationary value. The dynamic strength increases with the increase of confining pressure, and the damage evolution can be denoted by the axial strain method in the process of cyclic loading.", "Theoretical model of hydraulic conductivity for frozen saline/non-saline soil based on freezing characteristic curve ": "The hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil has significant effects on the moisture and solute migration and on the ice segregation in frost heave when the soil is being frozen. In this study, in accordance with the thermodynamic theory of unfrozen water film, the variation of chemical potential energy of water film due to salt and soil particles is considered. It is highlighted that moisture migration in the frozen soil can be considered as the Darcy flow under a new equivalent water pressure control. On that basis, the expression of pore water freezing temperature and pore radius is yielded, and then the capillary bundle theory and the soil frozen characteristic curve (SFCC) are used for the frozen soil to build a theoretical model to predict the hydraulic conductivity of frozen saline/non-saline soil. Through the comparison of four empirical equations and experimental data, the results achieved using our theoretical model can help to predict the hydraulic conductivity of the frozen soil. Furthermore, frozen non-saline soil achieves 12.47% the contribution of unfrozen water film to hydraulic conductivity, and frozen saline soil achieves 11.25% according to warm frozen soil from 0 to \u22122\u202f\u00b0C. Thus, this important channel cannot be ignored for water migration. Actually, this theoretical model gives an important parameter to the numerical simulation of frost heave in cold regions engineering, which can be referenced for the study on hydraulic conductivity of frozen saline/non-saline soil.", "Revisiting parameters that dictate the mechanical behavior of frozen soils ": "Construction of infrastructure in seasonally freezing and permafrost areas and the need for temporary improvement of slopes and weak sites with artificial freezing have been the impetuses for the observed growth in frozen ground engineering. A proper understanding of the mechanical behavior of frozen soils is necessary for the development of prediction models and the successful implementation of frozen ground engineering. The major parameters that affect the mechanical behavior of frozen soils were identified as the ice content, temperature, confining pressure, and strain rate. Focusing on the contribution of each phase, the effect of these parameters, on the mechanical behavior of frozen soil, is investigated. Bishop's effective stress for unsaturated soils is extended, to account for the aforementioned parameters, and introduced for frozen soils. The new effective stress is defined to have two components so that it accommodates the intergranular stresses carried by the soil grains and the ice crystals.", "Ground-penetrating radar studies of permafrost, periglacial, and near-surface geology at McMurdo Station, Antarctica ": "Installations built on ice, permafrost, or seasonal frozen ground require careful design to avoid melting issues. Therefore, efforts to rebuild McMurdo Station, Antarctica, to improve operational efficiency and consolidate energy resources require knowledge of near-surface geology. Both 200 and 400MHz ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data were collected in McMurdo during January, October, and November of 2015 to detect the active layer, permafrost, excess ice, fill thickness, solid bedrock depth, and buried utilities or construction and waste debris. Our goal was to ultimately improve surficial geology knowledge from a geotechnical perspective. Radar penetration ranged between approximately 3 and 10m depth for the 400 and 200MHz antennas, respectively. Both antennas successfully detect buried utilities and near-surface stratified material to ~0.5\u20133.0m whereas 200MHz profiles were more useful for mapping deeper stratified and un-stratified fill over bedrock. Artificially generated excess ice which appears to have been created from runoff, water pooling and refreezing, aspect shading from buildings, and snowpack buried under fill, are prevalent. Results show that McMurdo Station has a complex myriad of ice-rich fill, scoria, fractured volcanic bedrock, permafrost, excess ice, and buried anthropogenically generated debris, each of which must be considered during future construction.", "Construction on permafrost foundations: Lessons learned from the Qinghai\u2013Tibet railroad ": "In allusion to the problems of the frozen soil engineering geology, the roadbed stability with climate change in construction of the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway (QTR), this paper provides overview of the frozen soil engineering problems before and during the QTR constructions. Based on the experiences and lessons learned from the road construction in permafrost areas, the authors recommended that the principle of \u201cpositive cooling\u201d of the railroad roadbed by lowering permafrost temperatures should be used in the design of the QTR, rather than that of \u201cpassive protection\u201d of permafrost through increasing thermal resistance of the roadway, such as simply increasing fill thickness and/or using thermal-insulation materials. This is especially important for the road sections in warm, ice-rich permafrost areas. In addition, this paper reviews several methods for \u201ccooled roadbed\u201d by controlling radiation, convection and conduction through modifying roadway structure and using different fill materials. Meanwhile, the authors also provide information on some existing problems and future monitoring programs along the QTR.", "Effect of moisture content on mechanical and damage behavior of frozen loess under triaxial condition along with different confining pressures ": "Combining to the triaxial compression or loading-unloading cyclic tests of frozen loess with moisture content of 12.31% and foregoing testing results with moisture content of 16.68% and 23.70% to further investigate the effect of moisture content on strength, stiffness and damage behaviors of frozen loess. The mechanical and damage parameters, i.e. triaxial shear strength, secant modulus E\n                     50, unloading modulus, dissipated energy (elastoplastic coupling degree) and damage degree, are investigated in detail. The effect of moisture content on mechanical properties under different confining pressures is analyzed firstly. The moisture content has a significant influence on the stress\u2013strain-volume change curve,which dominates the evolution trend of mechanical properties. Triaxial loading/unloading cyclic tests under different confining pressures are capable of determining the damage parameters as well as their degradation laws during triaxial tests. The test results indicate that the moisture content of frozen soils is an important factor for damage parameters during the deformation process. The influences of confining pressure on both the mechanical and damage behaviors of frozen loess are sensitive to the moisture content of frozen loess, which indicates that the effects of moisture content and confining pressure are coupled. The difference of consolidation degrees and pressure melting caused by the confining pressure for the frozen loess with different moisture contents is response for the coupled effect of the moisture content and confining pressure.", "Speed and attenuation of acoustic waves in snow: Laboratory experiments and modeling with Biot's theory ": "Monitoring acoustic emissions (AE) prior to imminent failure is considered a promising technique for assessing snow slope instability. Gaps in elastic wave propagation characteristics in snow hinder quantitative interpretation of AE signals. Our study focuses on characterizing the propagation of acoustic reference signals in the ultrasonic range across cylindrical snow samples with varying density (240\u2013450kgm\u22123). We deduced the acoustic attenuation coefficient within snow by performing experiments with different column lengths to eliminate possible influences of the snow-sensor coupling. The attenuation coefficient was measured for the entire burst signal and for single frequency components in the range of 8 to 35kHz. The acoustic wave propagation speed, calculated from the travel time of the acoustic signal, varied between 300ms\u22121 and 950ms\u22121, depending on the density and hardness of snow. From the sound speed we also estimated the Young's modulus of our snow samples; the values of the modulus ranged from 30 to 340MPa for densities between 240 and 450kgm\u22123. In addition, we modeled the sound propagation for our experimental setup using Biot's model for wave propagation in a porous medium. The model results were in good agreement with our experimental results and suggest that our acoustic signals consisted of Biot's slow and fast waves. Our results can be used to improve the identification and localization of acoustic emission sources within snow in view of assessing snow slope instability.", "Discrete element simulation of the resistance of a ship in unconsolidated ridges ": "Resistance on a ship penetrating a sea ice ridge is a key design parameter of ice breaking ships. The resistance of a ship in an unconsolidated ridge has been studied by using a three dimensional discrete element method. Ridges of equal depth but different widths were used and it was observed that the ridge width has a major effect on the ridge resistance: the ridge resistance increases with increasing ridge width, until the ridge width is of the same order as the ship length. The ridge resistance was decomposed into a frictional force and a deformation force. The deformation force is due to the ridge deformation by the ship bow and it was shown that the deformation force is related with the mass of ice blocks accelerated by and moving with the ship.", "A physical SNOWPACK model for the Swiss avalanche warning Part I: numerical model": "The numerical formulation of a one-dimensional physical snowpack model is presented. The model is operationally employed on a day-to-day basis by avalanche warners to predict snowpack settlement, layering, surface energy exchange and mass balance. Meteorological data obtained from automatic weather stations positioned near avalanche starting zones is used as model input. In this paper, the one-dimensional equations governing the heat transfer, water transport, vapour diffusion and mechanical deformation of a phase changing snowpack are stated. New snow, wind drift and snow ablation are treated as special mass boundary conditions. Snow is modelled as a three-component (ice, water, air) porous material capable of undergoing large irreversible viscous deformations. Phase changes between the components are simulated. Snow layers are defined not only in terms of height and density, but also microstructure. That is, by the size, shape and bonding of the grains composing the ice lattice. The governing differential equations are solved using a fully implicit Lagrangian Gauss\u2013Seidel finite-element method. Example calculations from the catastrophic avalanche winter 1999 are presented to document model performance. The overall mass balance evaluation shows that the model accurately predicts the build-up and ablation of the seasonal alpine snowcover.", "Experimental study on the volume and strength change of an unsaturated silty clay upon freezing ": "In order to investigate the frost deformation and shear strength increment characteristics of unsaturated soil, a comprehensive experimental study was conducted to unsaturated slity clay samples with considering the influence of soil initial dry density and water content. Micro-structure observation tests, three-dimensional frost deformation tests, direct shear tests and soil compression tests are carried out. The frost deformation test results demonstrate that frost shrinkage happens when soil initial degree of saturation (S\n                     r) is low, whereas frost heave and frost cracking happen when soil initial S\n                     r is high. There is a critical degree of saturation at which frost shrinkage will turn into frost expansion. For the silty clay tested, this critical value is about 0.75. The frost shrinkage of soil is considered to be owing to the increase of cohesion upon freezing. The frost expansion of soil is induced by the fabric rearrangement which happens when pore-water changes into ice upon freezing. The shear strength test results demonstrate that soil friction angle does not vary much upon freezing, whereas soil cohesion increases a lot because of the generation of ice cementation and the increase of capillary cohesion. With assuming the increment of capillary cohesion upon freezing is equal to that upon drying for soil samples with same reduction of pore-water content, the ice cementation of frozen soil is found to be linear to its volumetric ice content. If the volume shrinkage induced by the increase of cohesion is assumed to be equal to that induced by the increase of mean principle stress with same values, the frost expansion induced by the water-ice phase transition is also linear to the volumetric ice content of unsaturated soil. Such linear relations seem to be unique and are applicable to unsaturated soil samples with any initial void ratio and water content.", "IoT and agriculture data analysis for smart farm ": "In this paper, we propose developing a system optimally watering agricultural crops based on a wireless sensor network. This work aimed to design and develop a control system using node sensors in the crop field with data management via smartphone and a web application. The three components are hardware, web application, and mobile application. The first component was designed and implemented in control box hardware connected to collect data on the crops. Soil moisture sensors are used to monitor the field, connecting to the control box. The second component is a web-based application that was designed and implemented to manipulate the details of crop data and field information. This component applied data mining to analyze the data for predicting suitable temperature, humidity, and soil moisture for optimal future management of crops growth. The final component is mainly used to control crop watering through a mobile application in a smartphone. This allows either automatic or manual control by the user. The automatic control uses data from soil moisture sensors for watering. However, the user can opt for manual control of watering the crops in the functional control mode. The system can send notifications through LINE API for the LINE application. The system was implemented and tested in Makhamtia District, Suratthani Province, Thailand. The results showed the implementation to be useful in agriculture. The moisture content of the soil was maintained appropriately for vegetable growth, reducing costs and increasing agricultural productivity.

As deep learning has been successfully applied in various domains, it has recently entered also the domain of agriculture. In this paper, we perform a survey of 40 research efforts that employ deep learning techniques, applied to various agricultural and food production challenges. We examine the particular agricultural problems under study, the specific models and frameworks employed, the sources, nature and pre-processing of data used, and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics used at each work under study. Moreover, we study comparisons of deep learning with other existing popular techniques, in respect to differences in classification or regression performance. Our findings indicate that deep learning provides high accuracy, outperforming existing commonly used image processing techniques.", "Soil sampling with drones and augmented reality in precision agriculture ": "Soil sampling is an important tool to gather information for making proper decisions regarding the fertilization of fields. Depending on the national regulations, the minimum frequency may be once per five years and spatially every ten hectares. For precision farming purposes, this is not sufficient. In precision farming, the challenge is to collect the samples from such regions that are internally consistent while limiting the number of samples required. For this purpose, management zones are used to divide the field into smaller regions. This article presents a novel approach to automatically determine the locations for soil samples based on a soil map created from drone imaging after ploughing, and a wearable augmented reality technology to guide the user to the generated sample points. Finally, the article presents the results of a demonstration carried out in southern Finland.", "A review on the practice of big data analysis in agriculture ": "To tackle the increasing challenges of agricultural production, the complex agricultural ecosystems need to be better understood. This can happen by means of modern digital technologies that monitor continuously the physical environment, producing large quantities of data in an unprecedented pace. The analysis of this (big) data would enable farmers and companies to extract value from it, improving their productivity. Although big data analysis is leading to advances in various industries, it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The objective of this paper is to perform a review on current studies and research works in agriculture which employ the recent practice of big data analysis, in order to solve various relevant problems. Thirty-four different studies are presented, examining the problem they address, the proposed solution, tools, algorithms and data used, nature and dimensions of big data employed, scale of use as well as overall impact. Concluding, our review highlights the large opportunities of big data analysis in agriculture towards smarter farming, showing that the availability of hardware and software, techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well as the increasing openness of big data sources, shall encourage more academic research, public sector initiatives and business ventures in the agricultural sector. This practice is still at an early development stage and many barriers need to be overcome.", "Development and evaluation of a low-cost and smart technology for precision weed management utilizing artificial intelligence ": "Most conventional sprayers apply agrochemicals uniformly, despite the fact that distribution of weeds is typically patchy, resulting in wastage of valuable compounds, increased costs, crop damage risk, pest resistance to chemicals, environmental pollution and contamination of products. To reduce these negative impacts, a smart sprayer was designed and developed utilizing machine vision and artificial intelligence to distinguish target weeds from non-target objects (e.g. vegetable crops) and precisely spray on the desired target/location. Two different experimental scenarios were designed to simulate a vegetable field and to evaluate the smart sprayer\u2019s performance. The first scenario contained artificial weeds (targets) and artificial plants (non-targets). The second and most challenging scenario contained real plants; portulaca weeds as targets, and sedge weeds and pepper plants as non-targets. Two different embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) were evaluated as the smart sprayer processing unit (for image processing and target detection). The more powerful GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti) achieved an overall precision of 71% and recall of 78% (for plant detection and target spraying accuracy) on the most challenging scenario with real plants, and 91% accuracy and recall for the first scenario with artificial plants. The less powerful GPU (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) achieved an overall precision and recall of 90% and 89% respectively on the first scenario with artificial plants, and 59% and 44% respectively on the second scenario with real plants. Finally, an RTK GPS was connected to the smart sprayer and an algorithm was developed to automatically generate weed maps and visualize the collected data (after every application). This smart technology integrates a state of the art (AI-based) weed detection system, a novel fast and precision spraying system, and a weed mapping system. It can significantly reduce the quantity of agrochemicals required, especially compared with traditional broadcast sprayers that usually treat the entire field, resulting in unnecessary application to areas that do not require treatment. It could also reduce costs, risk of crop damage and excess herbicide residue, as well as potentially reduce environmental impact.", "Deep learning models for plant disease detection and diagnosis ": "In this paper, convolutional neural network models were developed to perform plant disease detection and diagnosis using simple leaves images of healthy and diseased plants, through deep learning methodologies. Training of the models was performed with the use of an open database of 87,848 images, containing 25 different plants in a set of 58 distinct classes of [plant, disease] combinations, including healthy plants. Several model architectures were trained, with the best performance reaching a 99.53% success rate in identifying the corresponding [plant, disease] combination (or healthy plant). The significantly high success rate makes the model a very useful advisory or early warning tool, and an approach that could be further expanded to support an integrated plant disease identification system to operate in real cultivation conditions.", "Current and future applications of statistical machine learning algorithms for agricultural machine vision systems ": "With being rapid increasing population in worldwide, the need for satisfactory level of crop production with decreased amount of agricultural lands. Machine vision would ensure the increase of crop production by using an automated, non-destructive and cost-effective technique. In last few years, remarkable results have been achieved in different sectors of agriculture. These achievements are integrated with machine learning techniques on machine vision approach that cope with colour, shape, texture and spectral analysis from the image of objects. Despite having many applications of different machine learning techniques, this review only described the statistical machine learning technologies with machine vision systems in agriculture due to broad area of machine learning applications.

The advantages of this system include simplicity, adaptability and low cost. The respirometer allowed the continuous measurement of CO2 concentration, barometric and differential pressures, and temperature. With the data obtained it was possible to calculate the CO2 production rate and to predict the O2 consumption rate and the respiratory quotient of the product, without using an O2 sensor. To assess the function of the device, the O2 and CO2 respiration rates of three products were determined. The good agreement observed between the respiratory quotient and the differential pressure suggests the possibility of using the differential pressure data as a direct indicator of the respiratory quotient evolution. This data could also be useful for monitoring metabolic shifts.", "Machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation in precision agriculture: A review ": "Accurate yield estimation and optimised nitrogen management is essential in agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) systems are being more widely used in building decision support tools for contemporary farming systems to improve yield production and nitrogen management while reducing operating costs and environmental impact. However, RS based approaches require processing of enormous amounts of remotely sensed data from different platforms and, therefore, greater attention is currently being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods. This is due to the capability of machine learning based systems to process a large number of inputs and handle non-linear tasks. This paper discusses research developments conducted within the last 15\u202fyears on machine learning based techniques for accurate crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The paper concludes that the rapid advances in sensing technologies and ML techniques will provide cost-effective and comprehensive solutions for better crop and environment state estimation and decision making. More targeted application of the sensor platforms and ML techniques, the fusion of different sensor modalities and expert knowledge, and the development of hybrid systems combining different ML and signal processing techniques are all likely to be part of precision agriculture (PA) in the near future.", "A new low-cost portable multispectral optical device for precise plant status assessment ": "Plant stress monitoring is of crucial importance to understand the plant response to environmental conditions, and has been widely applied in various fields including biology, agronomy, botany, and horticulture. A number of methods and instruments for plant stress monitoring have been proposed, most of which show significant disadvantages such as high cost, poor accuracy or complex operation that limit the use of such devices. In this paper, we propose a low cost, portable active multispectral optical device for precise plant stress detection and field mapping named Plant-O-Meter. The device has an integrated multispectral source that comprises light sources of the four most indicative wavelengths (850, 630, 535 and 465\u202fnm), and enables simultaneous illumination of the whole plant. Sequential illumination and detection provide rapid reflectance measurements, which are wirelessly transmitted to android operated devices for processing and data storing. The device was tested in laboratory conditions comparing the Plant-O-Meter measurements with the image results from a SPECIM hyperspectral camera and a GreenSeeker handheld device and under field conditions with the GreenSeeker. The comparison revealed comparable performance, showing strong correlation with both the hyperspectral (R2\u202f=\u202f0.997) and the GreenSeeker handheld (R2\u202f=\u202f0.954 from the laboratory measurements and R2\u202f=\u202f0.886 from the field experiments), indicating that the device exhibits strong potential for accurate plant stress measurements. Moreover, owing to the very simple operating principle, the device represents a compact, cost-effective, and easy-to-operate solution.", "Evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and its significant impact in the field of Precision Agriculture ": "During recent years, one of the most familiar name scaling new heights and creating a benchmark is Internet of Things (IoT). It is indeed the future of communication that has transformed Things (Objects) of the real world into smarter devices. The functional aspect of IoT is to unite every object of the world in such a manner that humans have the ability to control them via Internet. Furthermore, these objects also provide regular as well as timely updates on their current status to its end user.

In this sense, the demand for efficient and safe methods of food production is increasing. Information Technology is one of the tools to that end. Among the available tools, we highlight computer vision solutions combined with artificial intelligence algorithms that achieved important results in the detection of patterns in images. In this context, this work presents a systematic review that aims to identify the applicability of computer vision in precision agriculture for the production of the five most produced grains in the world: maize, rice, wheat, soybean, and barley. In this sense, we present 25 papers selected in the last five years with different approaches to treat aspects related to disease detection, grain quality, and phenotyping.

This paper presents ALSE, an intelligent system for assessing land suitability for different types of crops in tropical and subtropical regions (e.g. mango, banana, papaya, citrus, and guava) based on geo-environmental factors that automates the process of evaluation and illustrates the results on an attribute table. Its main features include support of GIS capabilities on the digital map of an area with the FAO-SYS framework model with some necessary modifications to suit the local environmental conditions for land evaluation, and the support of expert knowledge through on spatial tools to derive criteria weights with their relative importance. A dynamic program for calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a weighting matrix is provided. Expertise and knowledge help ensure that ALSE databases represent realistic, practicable and functional systems. It is useful for decision makers to determine the quality of land for agricultural uses and is intended as a decision and planning support. Responsibility for any decisions based partly or wholly on the output of ALSE rests with the decision maker. ALSE ensures that the results are interpreted correctly within the relevant context, and contributes by maximizing land-use planning and decision support.", "Apple detection during different growth stages in orchards using the improved YOLO-V3 model ": "Real-time detection of apples in orchards is one of the most important methods for judging growth stages of apples and estimating yield. The size, colour, cluster density, and other growth characteristics of apples change as they grow. Traditional detection methods can only detect apples during a particular growth stage, but these methods cannot be adapted to different growth stages using the same model. We propose an improved YOLO-V3 model for detecting apples during different growth stages in orchards with fluctuating illumination, complex backgrounds, overlapping apples, and branches and leaves. Images of young apples, expanding apples, and ripe apples are initially collected. These images are subsequently augmented using rotation transformation, colour balance transformation, brightness transformation, and blur processing. The augmented images are used to create training sets. The DenseNet method is used to process feature layers with low resolution in the YOLO-V3 network. This effectively enhances feature propagation, promotes feature reuse, and improves network performance. After training the model, the performance of the trained model is tested on a test dataset. The test results show that the proposed YOLOV3-dense model is superior to the original YOLO-V3 model and the Faster R-CNN with VGG16 net model, which is the state-of-art fruit detection model. The average detection time of the model is \n                        \n                           0.304\n                           \n                           s\n                        \n                      per frame at 3000\u202f\n                        \n                           \u00d7\n                        \n                     \u202f3000 resolution, which can provide real-time detection of apples in orchards. Moreover, the YOLOV3-dense model can effectively provide apple detection under overlapping apples and occlusion conditions, and can be applied in the actual environment of orchards.", "Deep learning \u2013 Method overview and review of use for fruit detection and yield estimation ": "A review of developments in the rapidly developing field of deep learning is presented. Recommendations are made for original contributions to the literature, as opposed to formulaic applications of established methods to new application areas (e.g., to new crops), including the use of standard metrics (e.g., F1 score, the harmonic mean between Precision and Recall) for model comparison involving binary classification. A recommendation for the provision and use of publically available fruit-in-orchard image sets is made, to allow method comparisons and for implementation of transfer learning for deep learning models trained on the large public generic datasets. Emphasis is placed on practical aspects for application of deep learning models for the task of fruit detection and localisation, in support of tree crop load estimation.

This is particularly true in plant breeding where collecting large-scale field-based plant phenotypes can be very labor intensive and costly. In this paper we reported a multi-sensor system for high throughput phenotyping in plant breeding. The system comprised five sensor modules (ultrasonic distance sensors, thermal infrared radiometers, NDVI sensors, portable spectrometers, and RGB web cameras) to measure crop canopy traits from field plots. A GPS was used to geo-reference the sensor measurements. Two environmental sensors (a solar radiation sensor and air temperature/relative humidity sensor) were also integrated into the system to collect simultaneous environmental data. A LabVIEW program was developed to control and synchronize measurements from all sensor modules and stored sensor readings in the host computer. Canopy reflectance spectra (by portable spectrometers) were post processed to extract NDVI and red-edge NDVI spectral indices; and RGB images were post processed to extract canopy green pixel fraction (as a proxy for biomass). The sensor system was tested in a soybean and wheat field trial. The results showed strong correlations among the sensor-based plant traits at both early and late growing season. Significant correlations were also found between the sensor-based traits and final grain yield at the early season (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient r ranged from 0.41 to 0.55) and late season (r from 0.55 to 0.70), suggesting the potential use of the sensor system to assist in phenotypic selection for plant breeding. The sensor system performed satisfactorily and robustly in the field tests. It was concluded that the sensor system could be a powerful tool for plant breeders to collect field-based, high throughput plant phenotyping data.", "Mapping forests using an unmanned ground vehicle with 3D LiDAR and graph-SLAM ": "Enabling automated 3D mapping in forests is an important component of the future development of forest technology, and has been garnering interest in the scientific community, as can be seen from the many recent publications. Accordingly, the authors of the present paper propose the use of a Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping algorithm, called graph-SLAM, to generate local maps of forests. In their study, the 3D data required for the mapping process were collected using a custom-made, mobile platform equipped with a number of sensors, including Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR, a stereo camera, an IMU, and a GPS. The 3D map was generated solely from laser scans, first by relying on laser odometry and then by improving it with robust graph optimisation after loop closures, which is the core of the graph-SLAM algorithm. The resulting map, in the form of a 3D point cloud, was then evaluated in terms of its accuracy and precision. Specifically, the accuracy of the fitted diameter at breast height (DBH) and the relative distance between the trees were evaluated. The results show that the DBH estimates using the Pratt circle fit method could enable a mean estimation error of approximately 2\u202fcm (7\u201312%) and an RMSE of 2.38\u202fcm (9%), whereas for tree positioning accuracy, the mean error was 0.0476\u202fm. The authors conclude that robust SLAM algorithms can support the development of forestry by providing cost-effective and acceptable quality methods for forest mapping. Moreover, such maps open up the possibility for precision localisation for forestry vehicles.", "\n               Agbots: Weeding a field with a team of autonomous robots ": "This work presents a strategy for coordinated multi-agent weeding under conditions of partial environmental information. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of coordination strategies for improving the weeding performance of autonomous agricultural robots. It is shown that, given a sufficient number of agents, a team of autonomous robots can successfully weed fields with various initial seed bank densities, even when multiple days are allowed to elapse before weeding commences. Furthermore, the use of information sharing between agents is demonstrated to strongly improve system performance as the number of agents increases.\n                  As a domain to test these algorithms, a simulation environment, Weed World, was developed, which allows real-time visualization of coordinated weeding policies, and includes realistic weed generation. In this work, experiments are conducted to determine the required number of agents for given initial seed bank densities and varying allowed days before the start of the weeding process.", "GeoFarmer: A monitoring and feedback system for agricultural development projects ": "Farmers can manage their crops and farms better if they can communicate their experiences, both positive and negative, with each other and with experts. Digital agriculture using internet communication technology (ICT) may facilitate the sharing of experiences between farmers themselves and with experts and others interested in agriculture. ICT approaches in agriculture are, however, still out of the reach of many farmers. The reasons are lack of connectivity, missing capacity building and poor usability of ICT applications. We decided to tackle this problem through cost-effective, easy to use ICT approaches, based on infrastructure and services currently available to small-scale producers in developing areas. Working through a participatory design approach, we developed and tested a novel technology. GeoFarmer provides near real-time, two-way data flows that support processes of co-innovation in agricultural development projects. It can be used as a cost-effective ICT-based platform to monitor agricultural production systems with interactive feedback between the users, within pre-defined geographical domains. We tested GeoFarmer in four geographic domains associated with ongoing agricultural development projects in East and West Africa and Latin America. We demonstrate that GeoFarmer is a cost-effective means of providing and sharing opportune indicators of on-farm performance. It is a potentially useful tool that farmers and agricultural practitioners can use to manage their crops and farms better, reduce risk, increase productivity and improve their livelihoods.", "A comparative study of fine-tuning deep learning models for plant disease identification ": "Deep learning has recently attracted a lot of attention with the aim to develop a quick, automatic and accurate system for image identification and classification. In this work, the focus was on fine-tuning and evaluation of state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network for image-based plant disease classification. An empirical comparison of the deep learning architecture is done. The architectures evaluated include VGG 16, Inception V4, ResNet with 50, 101 and 152 layers and DenseNets with 121 layers. The data used for the experiment is 38 different classes including diseased and healthy images of leafs of 14 plants from plantVillage. Fast and accurate models for plant disease identification are desired so that accurate measures can be applied early. Thus, alleviating the problem of food security. In our experiment, DenseNets has tendency\u2019s to consistently improve in accuracy with growing number of epochs, with no signs of overfitting and performance deterioration. Moreover, DenseNets requires a considerably less number of parameters and reasonable computing time to achieve state-of-the-art performances. It achieves a testing accuracy score of 99.75% to beat the rest of the architectures. Keras with Theano backend was used to perform the training of the architectures.", "IoT based low cost and intelligent module for smart irrigation system ": "Agriculture contributes to a major share in the Indian economy and most of its people are dependent on it for their livelihood. This makes water an important resource that needs to be preserved using the latest available technologies. Apart from being fundamental in industry 4.0, IoT also extends its capability to smart farming. Work proposed here targets to develop a low cost intelligent system for smart irrigation. It uses IoT to make devices used in the system to talk and connect on their own, with capabilities like: admin mode for user interaction, one-time setup for irrigation schedule estimation, neural based decision making for intelligent support and remote data monitoring. A sample crop test-bed has been chosen to present results of the proposed system, that include irrigation schedule, neural net decision making and remote data viewing. Neural network provides required intelligence to the device that considers current sensor input and masks the irrigation schedule for efficient irrigation. The system uses MQTT and HTTP to keep the user informed about the current crop situation even from a distant location. The proposed system proves beneficial with its intelligence, low cost and portability, making it suitable for greenhouse, farms, etc.", "EVAPO: A smartphone application to estimate potential evapotranspiration using cloud gridded meteorological data from NASA-POWER system ": "In this study a new android app for smartphones to estimate potential evapotranspuration (PET) in real time, using gridded data from NASA-POWER, to any location in the world, would result in a more efficient irrigation and increase irrigation water conservation. The smartphone app called EVAPO uses meteorological data to calculate PET using the Penman\u2013Monteith (FAO56) method. To evaluate performance of the proposed method, we compared PET estimated by the EVAPO with that estimated from climatic data from conventional surface meteorological stations. The accuracy, tendency and precision of the models were determined using the Willmott et al. (1985) concordance index (d), systematic root mean square error (RMSEs) and determination index (R2), respectively. The results obtained were satisfactory for all studied locations whit mean values of 0.67, 0.95 (mm) and 0.72 for d, RMSEs and R2, respectively. The app can be accessed in the Play Store (free): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.maldonado.instantet0.", "Wheat yellow rust monitoring by learning from multispectral UAV aerial imagery ": "The use of a low-cost five-band multispectral camera (RedEdge, MicaSense, USA) and a low-altitude airborne platform is investigated for the detection of plant stress caused by yellow rust disease in winter wheat for sustainable agriculture. The research is mainly focused on: (i) determining whether or not healthy and yellow rust infected wheat plants can be discriminated; (ii) selecting spectral band and Spectral Vegetation Index (SVI) with a strong discriminating capability; (iii) developing a low-cost yellow rust monitoring system for use at farmland scales. An experiment was carefully designed by infecting winter wheat with different levels of yellow rust inoculum, where aerial multispectral images under different developmental stages of yellow rust were captured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle at an altitude of 16\u201324\u202fm with a ground resolution of 1\u20131.5\u202fcm/pixel. An automated yellow rust detection system is developed by learning (via random forest classifier) from labelled UAV aerial multispectral imagery. Experimental results indicate that: (i) good classification performance (with an average Precision, Recall and Accuracy of 89.2%, 89.4% and 89.3%) was achieved by the developed yellow rust monitoring at a diseased stage (45\u202fdays after inoculation); (ii) the top three SVIs for separating healthy and yellow rust infected wheat plants are RVI, NDVI and OSAVI; while the top two spectral bands are NIR and Red. The learnt system was also applied to the whole farmland of interest with a promising monitoring result. It is anticipated that this study by seamlessly integrating low-cost multispectral camera, low-altitude UAV platform and machine learning techniques paves the way for yellow rust monitoring at farmland scales.", "Automated pig counting using deep learning ": "Pig counting is one of the most critical topics in farming management and asset estimation. Due to its complexity, traditional agriculture method relies on manual counting, which is obviously inefficient and a waste of manpower. The challenging aspects like partial occlusion, overlapping and different perspectives even limit the usage of traditional computer vision techniques. In recent years, deep learning has become more and more popular for computer vision applications, because of its superior performance comparing to traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a deep learning solution to address the pig counting problem. We present a modified Counting Convolutional Neural Network (Counting CNN) model according to the structure of ResNeXt, and tune a series of experimental parameters. Our CNN model learns the mapping from the image feature to the density map, and obtains the total number of pigs in the entire image by integrating the density map. In order to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset collected from actual piggery farming with 15 pigs in an image averagely. We achieve 1.67 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) per image and outperforms the competing algorithms, which strongly demonstrates that our proposed method can accurately estimate the number of pigs even if they are partially occluded in different perspectives. The detection speed, 42\u202fms per image, meets the requirements of agricultural application. We share our code and the first pig dataset we collected for pig counting at https://github.com/xixiareone/counting-pigs for livestock husbandry and science research community.", "A review of the evidence on the relation between crude oil prices and petroleum product prices ": "We review a large body of the empirical literature focusing on the relation between petroleum product prices and oil prices and discuss the evidence on the direction of causality between crude oil prices and petroleum product prices. In addition, we survey the literature on the much-debated question of whether petroleum product prices respond differently to increases versus decreases in oil prices, which Bacon (1991) labeled the \u201crockets and feathers\u201d phenomenon.", "Jumps in commodity markets ": "This paper investigates price jumps in commodity markets. We find that jumps are rare and extreme events but occur less frequently than in stock markets. Nonetheless, jump correlations across commodities can be high depending on the commodity sectors. Energy, metal and grains commodities show high jump correlations while jumps of meats and softs commodities are barely correlated. Looking at cross-market correlations, we find that returns of commodities co-move with the stock market, while jumps can be diversified. Most commodities are strong hedges for U.S. Dollar returns but weak hedges for U.S. Dollar jumps. Most commodities act as both return and jump hedges for Treasury notes.", "Price volatility and speculative activities in futures commodity markets: A combination of combinations of p-values test ": "The present study investigates the relation between different measures of price volatility (conditional, historical and implied) and different types of speculation (short-run, long-run and excessive) in futures commodity markets for the period 2000\u20132015. To this purpose, we first use a pairwise Granger causality analysis for 28 individual commodities belonging to energy, agricultural and metal markets. Then, we implement a novel combination of combinations of p-values test to assess whether lead-lag relations exist between speculation and price volatility for broad categories of commodities. The results of both testing procedures show that the majority of significant relations refer to agricultural commodities and that tendentially short-run speculation leads volatility. This means that noise trading has a leading power on market volatility and scalpers are a class of volatility-drivers.", "Real option valuation of open pit mines with two processing methods ": "This paper proposes a real option model for valuing open pit mines with two processing methods under commodity price uncertainty. The model considers the flexibility that open pit mines have in order to decide if the ore being mined will be processed or sent to the waste dump. In addition, it enables to maximize the net present value of the mine through the use of the mining sequence and the extraction rate as decision variables. A numerical example is used to illustrate the model and the effect that price uncertainty has in the design of a mining project. The main result obtained is that an open pit mine can significantly enhance its value under a design that considers two processing methods instead of one.", "Characteristics of petroleum product prices: A survey ": "We review and synthesize the empirical evidence on several factors related to petroleum product prices: (1) the general distributional characteristics of petroleum product prices; (2) the influence of refinery outages, extreme weather, and similar circumstances on product prices; (3) the way that price discovery occurs for petroleum products; (4) the predictive accuracy of petroleum product futures prices for future spot prices; and (5) the impact of speculation on product prices.", "Electricity markets around the world ": "We examine wholesale electricity spot prices around the world. Based on a comprehensive dataset of intraday prices for 28 market regions in 19 countries, we compare the markets with regards to price variation and market structure. In particular, seasonal patterns, volatility, and the occurrence of price spikes are examined and compared with respect to determinants such as market design and production characteristics. We find that regional electricity markets in Australia are characterized by relatively low levels of annual, weekly and intra-daily seasonal patterns, but are by far the most volatile markets in this study. We also conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) based on the identified market characteristics to further investigate the differences between the considered markets. Our results illustrate that more than 80% of the variance in the data can be explained by three principal components, that, based on their loadings can be interpreted as a dispersion factor, a weekly and intra-daily seasonality factor and a factor related to price levels. We also find that electricity markets organized as day-ahead markets exhibit a significantly lower overall price variation compared to markets with real-time trading. These differences exist in a cross-market observation, as well as for markets that feature both trading schemes. Our results provide important information for market participants by classifying the considered markets with respect to associated price and volatility risks.", "Market specific seasonal trading behavior in NASDAQ OMX electricity options ": "This study examines trading behavior in the NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe electricity options' financial market using intraday data on individual option transactions. We postulate that the market differs from many other asset markets in that the main reason to trade is to hedge the price and quantity risks encountered in the physical market and because electricity is non-storable. Thus, in contrast to many other, more speculatively oriented markets, we find several disjunctive patterns in the trading of options. First, options on quarterly futures, providing the most flexible tools for hedging, are more heavily traded than options on yearly futures contracts. Second, trading activity is higher in options used to hedge against the coldest (i.e., peak) months. Third, trading activity is not higher prior to the expiry of options, implying that contracts are initiated early and not closed out prior to expiration. Fourth, trading activity does not decrease during the summer months. The results have several theoretical and practical implications.", "Comovement in the commodity futures markets: An analysis of the energy, grains, and livestock sectors ": "We examine the excess comovement of commodity futures returns. We contend that commodities categorized in the same sector possess fundamental price linkages; thus, measures of excess comovement \"within-sectors\" are much higher relative to \"across-sector\" measures. Consistent with this premise we find that all copula model dependence measures used in the study capture this feature of the commodity markets. Further, we test the relevance of two new \"cross-market\" factors related to changes in inventory and open interest as determinants of commodity futures returns. We find a strong positive relationship between changes in cross-market open interest and futures returns to the energy and livestock markets. In contrast, the impact of changes in cross-market inventory on futures returns to the energy and grains sectors is very minor.", "Price discovery in agricultural commodity markets in the presence of futures speculation ": "We study the relationship between spot and futures prices of corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and oil, feeder and live cattle, as well as lean hogs to test which markets lead price discovery in these commodities. Using a recently developed unique information share we find evidence that the prices of these commodities are almost uniquely formed in the spot market. The market for futures contracts contributes less than 10% to price discovery (in the Hasbrouck sense). We interpret these results as evidence against adverse effects of futures speculation on commodity prices in the long run.", "Financialization and the returns to commodity investments ": "Commodity futures investment grew rapidly after their popularity exploded\u2014along with commodity prices\u2014in the mid-2000s. Numerous individuals and institutions embraced alternative investments for their purported diversification benefits and equity-like returns. We investigate whether the \u201cfinancialization\u201d of commodity futures markets reduced the risk premiums available to long-only investors in commodities. While energy futures markets generally exhibit a decline in risk premiums after 2004, premiums in all but one non-energy futures market actually increased over the same time period. Overall, the average unconditional return to individual commodity futures markets is approximately equal to zero before and after financialization.", "Price discovery in agricultural commodity markets: Do speculators contribute? ": "Previous literature on price discovery in commodity markets is mainly focused on the question of whether the spot or the futures market dominates the price discovery process. Little attention, however, has been paid to the question of how the price discovery process is affected by futures speculation. Using different measures for speculation and hedging and a new price discovery metric, the present study analyzes this relationship for various agricultural commodities. On the whole, the results suggest that speculative activity reduces the level of noise in the futures markets under analysis, while increasing their relative contribution to the price discovery process.", "Long-short commodity investing: A review of the literature ": "This article reviews recent academic studies that analyze the performance of long-short strategies in commodity futures markets. Special attention is devoted to the strategies based on roll-yields, inventory levels or hedging pressure that directly arise from the theory of storage and the hedging pressure hypothesis. Alternative strategies based on past performance, risk, value, skewness, liquidity or inflation betas are also studied, alongside with recent attempts to enhance performance by modifying or combining the original signals. Overall, the literature highlights the superiority of being long-short in commodity futures markets relative to being long-only.", "A review of the literature on commodity risk management ": "This paper analyzes research on commodity risk management by nonfinancial firms and provides a review of the findings to date. We discuss the theories and methodologies used including the models best suited for examining commodity risk management and exposure. In this study, we review how the research to date provides evidence to the following questions. Is commodity risk reflected in share price behavior? Is the use of commodity risk management tools (derivatives) associated with reduced risk? Is there a relationship between the use of commodity risk management and the value of the firm? What other factors are important to commodity risk management? Suggestions are provided for future research in this area.", "The impact of global financial crisis on informational efficiency: Evidence from price-volume relation in crude palm oil futures market ": "This study examines price-volume relation in crude palm oil (CPO) futures market during the pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis periods. Based on daily data from January 2000 to July 2017, cross-correlation function (CCF) provides four findings: First, volatilities of past trading volume and current return are correlated in pre- and post-crisis with an inconsistent sign, supporting the nature of noise trader demand. Second, in the pre-crisis period, both volatilities are negatively correlated within a short time span. Third, during the crisis period, there is no volatility spillover between both series. Fourth, in the post-crisis period, both volatilities of past trading volume and current return are positively correlated within a long time span, in addition to volatility spillover from the current return to the future trading volume which also happens within a short time span. Notably, significant volatility spillovers from trading volume to return across the crisis change the sign of correlations with a longer time span, supporting the \u201cheterogeneity of traders\u201d hypothesis. This study suggests that market participants have become risk-averse, particularly after the crisis. As a result, there has been an increase in volatility persistence which reduces the level of informational efficiency.", "Can agricultural commodity prices predict Nigeria's inflation? ": "This study examines the predictability of agricultural commodity prices in Nigeria's inflation forecast. It considers twelve major agricultural commodities and their predictability are evaluated singly and jointly for both food and headline inflation using various methodological approaches. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the predictor series exhibit some salient features such as persistence, endogeneity and conditional heteroscedasticity (high volatility) effects. Also, the parameters of the agricultural commodity-based inflation model tend to shift over short periods based on the results of the Bai and Perron (2003) test. Thus, we employ the Westerlund and Narayan (2015) estimator which accounts for these salient features. Also, we control for the time-varying parameters of the inflation model using the breaks obtained from the Bai and Perron (2003) test as well as the recursive (expanded) window approach. Our results show that agricultural commodities individually predict both headline and food inflation better than the random walk model which is the benchmark model for forecasting inflation in the literature. Thereafter, we construct a composite index for all the agricultural commodities using the principal components approach and the performance of the predictive model significantly improves relative to the individual agricultural commodities particularly when food inflation is considered. These results are consistent for both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and are robust to alternative measures of forecast performance, multiple forecast horizons and different data frequencies.", "An update on speculation and financialization in commodity markets ": "This paper reviews the more recent literature addressing different facets of speculation in commodity markets, including the role of speculators and the impact that financialization in recent years. While speculation and financialization can theoretically destabilize commodity markets, the extant literature finds little evidence of destabilization and documents that speculators largely provide liquidity to hedgers. Moreover, recent concern that commodity index trading leads to price distortions has little support in the data.", "Momentum and mean-reversion in commodity spot and futures markets ": "We study momentum and mean-reversion strategies in commodity futures prices and their relationship to momentum and mean-reversion in commodity spot prices. We find that momentum performs well in futures markets, but not in spot markets, and that mean-reversion performs well in spot markets, but not in futures markets. A decomposition of the basis (the slope of the term-structure of futures prices) into expected risk premiums and expected changes in spot prices helps us shed some light on the different results across the futures and spot markets. Most interestingly, we find that momentum in futures prices cannot be explained by a sustained trend in spot prices.", "The economics of commodity market manipulation: A survey ": "Manipulation has been a vexing subject in commodity futures markets from the mid-19th century. The economics literature has identified several kinds of manipulation, including market power manipulation, trade-based manipulation, and manipulation by fraud. Furthermore, this literature has identified how these various forms of manipulation can occur, their effects on prices and quantities, and in some cases, their welfare effects. In contrast to the economics literature, manipulation jurisprudence and regulation has often been confused and ineffective, in large part because it has not adequately incorporated the lessons of economics.", "Globalization and commoditization: The transformation of the seafood market ": "The seafood market has changed dramatically in recent decades. Increased trade has created a global market for groups of species with similar characteristics, and the number of species that are becoming part of these global market segments continue to grow. Increased trade and stagnating landings of wild fish has also facilitated the rapid growth of the aquaculture industry and made it the world's fastest growing food production technology. The growth in aquaculture has been sufficient to also increase the per capita consumption of seafood globally. These two factors have allowed scale, modern logistics and marketing practices to be used also for seafood, increasingly commoditizing the main species groups.", "The impact of speculation on commodity futures markets \u2013 A review of the findings of 100 empirical studies ": "There are numerous empirical studies on the impact of speculation on commodity futures markets. The papers strongly differ in terms of the focus variable (e.g. price, volatility, spill-over effects) of speculative effects, the speculation measure used, and broad quality. We review and evaluate the methodology and results of 100 papers which have been published (or are at least frequently cited) on this subject over the past decade. While the overall picture indicates that the number of studies which support and contradict the criticized effects of speculation is about the same, the results shift against the criticized effects if the studies use direct measures of speculation, except for price. Applying different paper quality standards does not fundamentally change our findings.", "On the correlation between commodity and equity returns: Implications for portfolio allocation ": "In recent years several commentators hinted at an increase of the correlation between equity and commodity returns, blaming for that surging investment in commodity-related products. This paper investigates such claims by looking at various measures of correlation, and assesses what are the implications of this for asset allocation. We develop a time-varying Bayesian Dynamic Conditional Correlation model and find that joint modelling commodity and equity prices produces accurate forecasts, which lead to benefits in portfolio allocation. This, however, comes at the price of higher volatility. Therefore, the popular view that commodities are to be included in investment portfolio as hedging device is not grounded.", "Commodity market flexibility and financial derivatives ": "This paper discusses the link between commodity market flexibility and financial derivatives. Real flexibility affects financial assets, directly, via the representative agent's ability to use real flexibility as substitute to holding financial options and, indirectly, via the aggregate effect of real flexibility on the dynamics of underlying commodity prices. Real flexibility is modelled as instantaneous adjustment of production in response to demand-driven changes in commodity prices and by gradual entry or exit of production units. Increased real flexibility typically reduces the market price of financial flexibility. The paper includes a short empirical section on oil and gas markets.", "Dynamic correlations between BRIC and U.S. stock markets: The asymmetric impact of volatility expectations in oil, gold and financial markets ": "This study investigates the impacts of volatility expectations in oil, gold, currency and the U.S. stock markets on time-varying conditional correlations between BRIC and U.S. stock markets. We use asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation and dynamic conditional correlation models to derive the time-varying relationships. We then examine the dynamic conditional correlations using quantile regressions for a detailed analysis of dependence structure containing non-linear and asymmetric interactions. Our results show that the impacts of volatility expectations in U.S. stock, gold, and oil markets on the correlations are asymmetric based on the level of correlations. Depending on the level of correlations, interdependence between the markets is driven by risk perceptions in both financial and non-financial markets. Our findings have important implications for determining international investment strategies.", "Do sovereign wealth funds dampen the negative effects of commodity price volatility? ": "This paper studies the impact of commodity terms of trade (CToT) volatility on economic growth (and its sources) in a sample of 69 commodity-dependent countries, and assesses the role of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and quality of institutions in their long-term growth performance. Using annual data over the period 1981\u20132014, we employ the Cross-Sectionally augmented Autoregressive Distributive Lag (CS-ARDL) methodology for estimation to account for cross-country heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, and feedback effects. We find that while CToT volatility exerts a negative impact on economic growth (operating through lower accumulation of physical capital and lower TFP), the average impact is dampened if a country has a SWF and better institutional quality (hence a more stable government expenditure).", "The consignment mechanism in carbon markets: A laboratory investigation ": "Unlike other auction-based carbon emission markets, California's carbon market (AB32) utilizes a consignment auction design in which utilities are allocated a share of emissions permits that they must sell into the uniform-price auction. Auction revenue is returned to the consignee, which creates an incentive to increase the auction clearing price through strategic bidding. In a numerical example, we identify the incentive that consignees have to overstate their quantity demanded in the auction, since this increases the probability that the auction clears at a higher price. This results in inefficient allocations and inflated auction prices. We test this effect through a series of laboratory experiments and confirm these predictions. Findings indicate that short-run firm profits are lower in a consignment auction than in a non-consignment auction market, and that firms are more likely to not receive the quantity of permits they need for program compliance in the auction. We conclude with implications for the design and modification of future Coasian markets.", "A survey of distributed optimization ": "In distributed optimization of multi-agent systems, agents cooperate to minimize a global function which is a sum of local objective functions. Motivated by applications including power systems, sensor networks, smart buildings, and smart manufacturing, various distributed optimization algorithms have been developed. In these algorithms, each agent performs local computation based on its own information and information received from its neighboring agents through the underlying communication network, so that the optimization problem can be solved in a distributed manner. This survey paper aims to offer a detailed overview of existing distributed optimization algorithms and their applications in power systems. More specifically, we first review discrete-time and continuous-time distributed optimization algorithms for undirected graphs. We then discuss how to extend these algorithms in various directions to handle more realistic scenarios. Finally, we focus on the application of distributed optimization in the optimal coordination of distributed energy resources.", "Earth climate identification vs. anthropic global warming attribution ": "Based on numerical models and climate observations over past centuries, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) attributes to human activity most of the warming observed since the mid-20th century. In this context, this paper presents the first major attempt for climate system identification \u2013 in the sense of the systems theory \u2013 in the hope to significantly reduce the uncertainty ranges. Actually, climatic data being what they are, the identified models only partially fulfill this expectation. Nevertheless, despite the dispersion of the identified parameters and of the induced simulations, one can draw robust conclusions which turn out to be incompatible with those of the IPCC: the natural contributions (solar activity and internal variability) could in fact be predominant in the recent warming. We then confront our work with the approach favored by IPCC, namely the \u201cdetection and attribution related to anthropic climate change\u201d. We explain the differences first by the exclusion by IPCC of the millennial paleoclimatic data, secondly by an obvious confusion between cause and effect, when the El Ni\u00f1o index is involved in detection and attribution.", "Reinforcement learning for control: Performance, stability, and deep approximators ": "Reinforcement learning (RL) offers powerful algorithms to search for optimal controllers of systems with nonlinear, possibly stochastic dynamics that are unknown or highly uncertain. This review mainly covers artificial-intelligence approaches to RL, from the viewpoint of the control engineer. We explain how approximate representations of the solution make RL feasible for problems with continuous states and control actions. Stability is a central concern in control, and we argue that while the control-theoretic RL subfield called adaptive dynamic programming is dedicated to it, stability of RL largely remains an open question. We also cover in detail the case where deep neural networks are used for approximation, leading to the field of deep RL, which has shown great success in recent years. With the control practitioner in mind, we outline opportunities and pitfalls of deep RL; and we close the survey with an outlook that \u2013 among other things \u2013 points out some avenues for bridging the gap between control and artificial-intelligence RL techniques.", "Control of connected and automated vehicles: State of the art and future challenges ": "Autonomous driving technology pledges safety, convenience, and energy efficiency. Its challenges include the unknown intentions of other road users: communication between vehicles and with the road infrastructure is a possible approach to enhance awareness and enable cooperation. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to disrupt mobility, extending what is possible with driving automation and connectivity alone. Applications include real-time control and planning with increased awareness, routing with micro-scale traffic information, coordinated platooning using traffic signals information, and eco-mobility on demand with guaranteed parking. This paper introduces a control and planning architecture for CAVs, and surveys the state of the art on each functional block therein; the main focus is on techniques to improve energy efficiency. We provide an overview of existing algorithms and their mutual interactions, we present promising optimization-based approaches to CAVs control and identify future challenges.", "Unmanned surface vehicles: An overview of developments and challenges ": "With growing worldwide interest in commercial, scientific, and military issues associated with both oceans and shallow waters, there has been a corresponding growth in demand for the development of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with advanced guidance, navigation and control (GNC) capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of recent progress in USVs development. The paper first provides an overview of both historical and recent USVs development, along with some fundamental definitions. Next, existing USVs GNC approaches are outlined and classified according to various criteria, such as their applications, methodologies, and challenges. Finally, more general challenges and future directions of USVs towards more practical GNC capabilities are highlighted.", "A systems and control perspective of CPS security ": "The comprehensive integration of instrumentation, communication, and control into physical systems has led to the study of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), a field that has recently garnered increased attention. A key concern that is ubiquitous in CPS is a need to ensure security in the face of cyber attacks. In this paper, we carry out a survey of systems and control methods that have been proposed for the security of CPS. We classify these methods into three categories based on the type of defense proposed against the cyberattacks: prevention, resilience, and detection & isolation. A unified threat assessment metric is proposed in order to evaluate how CPS security is achieved in each of these three cases. Also surveyed are the risk assessment tools and the effect of network topology on CPS security. Furthermore, an emphasis has been placed on power and transportation applications in the overall survey.", "Enabling the human in the loop: Linked data and knowledge in industrial cyber-physical systems ": "Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems have benefitted substantially from the introduction of a range of technology enablers. These include web-based and semantic computing, ubiquitous sensing, internet of things (IoT) with multi-connectivity, advanced computing architectures and digital platforms, coupled with edge or cloud side data management and analytics, and have contributed to shaping up enhanced or new data value chains in manufacturing. While parts of such data flows are increasingly automated, there is now a greater demand for more effectively integrating, rather than eliminating, human cognitive capabilities in the loop of production related processes. Human integration in Cyber-Physical environments can already be digitally supported in various ways. However, incorporating human skills and tangible knowledge requires approaches and technological solutions that facilitate the engagement of personnel within technical systems in ways that take advantage or amplify their cognitive capabilities to achieve more effective sociotechnical systems. After analysing related research, this paper introduces a novel viewpoint for enabling human in the loop engagement linked to cognitive capabilities and highlighting the role of context information management in industrial systems. Furthermore, it presents examples of technology enablers for placing the human in the loop at selected application cases relevant to production environments. Such placement benefits from the joint management of linked maintenance data and knowledge, expands the power of machine learning for asset awareness with embedded event detection, and facilitates IoT-driven analytics for product lifecycle management.", "Systems & Control for the future of humanity, research agenda: Current and future roles, impact and grand challenges ": "Following in the footsteps of the renowned report \u201cControl in an Information Rich World,\u201d Report of the Panel on \u201cFuture Directions in Control, Dynamics, and Systems\u201d chaired by Richard Murray (2002), this paper aims to demonstrate that Systems & Control is at the heart of the Information and Communication Technologies to most application domains. As such, Systems & Control should be acknowledged as a priority by funding agencies and supported at the levels necessary to enable technologies addressing critical societal challenges. A second intention of this paper is to present to the industrials and the young research generation, a global picture of the societal and research challenges where the discipline of Systems & Control will play a key role. Throughout, this paper demonstrates the extremely rich, current and future, cross-fertilization between five critical societal challenges and seven key research and innovation Systems & Control scientific challenges. This paper is authored by members of the IFAC Task Road Map Committee, established following the 19th IFAC World Congress in Cape Town. Other experts who authored specific parts are listed below.", "Survey on time-delay approach to networked control ": "This paper provides a survey on time-delay approach to networked control systems (NCSs). The survey begins from a brief summary on fundamental network-induced issues in NCSs and the main approaches to the modelling of NCSs. In particular, a comprehensive introduction to time-delay approach to sampled-data and networked control is provided. Then, recent results on time-delay approach to event-triggered control are recalled. The survey highlights time-delay approach developed to modelling, analysis and synthesis of NCSs, under communication constraints, with a particular focus on Round-Robin, Try-once-discard and stochastic protocols. The time-delay approach allows communication delays to be larger than the sampling intervals in the presence of scheduling protocols. Moreover, some results on networked control of distributed parameter systems are surveyed. Finally, conclusions and some future research directions are briefly addressed.", "Model-based fault-detection and diagnosis \u2013 status and applications ": "For the improvement of reliability, safety and efficiency advanced methods of supervision, fault-detection and fault diagnosis become increasingly important for many technical processes. This holds especially for safety related processes like aircraft, trains, automobiles, power plants and chemical plants. The classical approaches are limit or trend checking of some measurable output variables. Because they do not give a deeper insight and usually do not allow a fault diagnosis, model-based methods of fault-detection were developed by using input and output signals and applying dynamic process models. These methods are based, e.g., on parameter estimation, parity equations or state observers. Also signal model approaches were developed. The goal is to generate several symptoms indicating the difference between nominal and faulty status. Based on different symptoms fault diagnosis procedures follow, determining the fault by applying classification or inference methods. This contribution gives a short introduction into the field and shows some applications for an actuator, a passenger car and a combustion engine.", "Fundamentals of smart manufacturing: A multi-thread perspective ": "The paper outlines key characteristics of smart manufacturing, data-driven, networked, connected, resource sharing, resilient, and sustainable. Manufacturing resiliency and sustainability have received limited attention in the literature and they are the focus of this paper. Both are related and offer challenges that may become differentiators of smart manufacturing. Resiliency provides businesses with defenses against natural and human caused adversities. The list of attributes provided in the paper is intended for comprehensive assessment of manufacturing resiliency. Solutions are needed to make businesses more resilient and sustainable. Research on business models equating sustainability with an industrial activity is suggested. A scheme for labeling environmental friendliness of materials makes as a token contribution to sustainability.", "Trajectory planning and tracking for autonomous overtaking: State-of-the-art and future prospects ": "Trajectory planning and trajectory tracking constitute two important functions of an autonomous overtaking system and a variety of strategies have been proposed in the literature for both functionalities. However, uncertainties in environment perception using the current generation of sensors has resulted in most proposed methods being applicable only during low-speed overtaking. In this paper, trajectory planning and trajectory tracking approaches for autonomous overtaking systems are reviewed. The trajectory planning techniques are compared based on aspects such as real-time implementation, computational requirements, and feasibility in real-world scenarios. This review shows that two important aspects of trajectory planning for high-speed overtaking are: (i) inclusion of vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints and (ii) accurate knowledge of the environment and surrounding obstacles. The review of trajectory tracking controllers for high-speed driving is based on different categories of control algorithms where their respective advantages and disadvantages are analysed. This study shows that while advanced control methods improve tracking performance, in most cases the results are valid only within well-regulated conditions. Therefore, existing autonomous overtaking solutions assume precise knowledge of surrounding environment which is not representative of real-world driving. The paper also discusses how in a connected driving environment, vehicles can access additional information that can expand their perception. Hence, the potential of cooperative information sharing for aiding autonomous high-speed overtaking manoeuvre is identified as a possible solution.", "Ubiquitous knowledge empowers the Smart Factory: The impacts of a Service-oriented Digital Twin on enterprises' performance ": "While the Industry 4.0 is idolizing the potential of an artificial intelligence embedded into ``things\", it is neglecting the role of the human component, which is still indispensable in different manufacturing activities, such as a machine setup or maintenance operations. The present research study first proposes an Industrial Internet pyramid as emergent human-centric manufacturing paradigm within Industry 4.0 in which central is the role of a Ubiquitous Knowledge about the manufacturing system intuitively accessed and used by the manufacturing employees. Second, the prototype of a Service-oriented Digital Twin, which leverage on a flexible ontology-oriented knowledge structure and on augmented reality combined to a vocal interaction system for an intuitive knowledge retrieval and fruition, has been designed and developed to deliver this manufacturing knowledge. Two test-beds, complimentary for the problems in practice (the former on the maintenance-production interface in a large enterprise, the latter majorly focused in production and setups in a small and medium enterprise), show the significant benefits in terms of time, costs and process quality, thus validating the approach proposed. This research shows that a human-centric and knowledge-driven approach can drive the performance of Industry 4.0 initiatives and lead a Smart Factory towards its full potential.", "Reinforcement learning and optimal adaptive control: An overview and implementation examples ": "This paper provides an overview of the reinforcement learning and optimal adaptive control literature and its application to robotics. Reinforcement learning is bridging the gap between traditional optimal control, adaptive control and bio-inspired learning techniques borrowed from animals. This work is highlighting some of the key techniques presented by well known researchers from the combined areas of reinforcement learning and optimal control theory. At the end, an example of an implementation of a novel model-free Q-learning based discrete optimal adaptive controller for a humanoid robot arm is presented. The controller uses a novel adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) reinforcement learning (RL) approach to develop an optimal policy on-line. The RL joint space tracking controller was implemented for two links (shoulder flexion and elbow flexion joints) of the arm of the humanoid Bristol-Elumotion-Robotic-Torso II (BERT II) torso. The constrained case (joint limits) of the RL scheme was tested for a single link (elbow flexion) of the BERT II arm by modifying the cost function to deal with the extra nonlinearity due to the joint constraints.", "Survey on data-driven industrial process monitoring and diagnosis ": "This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the methods and applications of data-driven fault detection and diagnosis that have been developed over the last two decades. The scope of the problem is described with reference to the scale and complexity of industrial process operations, where multi-level hierarchical optimization and control are necessary for efficient operation, but are also prone to hard failure and soft operational faults that lead to economic losses. Commonly used multivariate statistical tools are introduced to characterize normal variations and detect abnormal changes. Further, diagnosis methods are surveyed and analyzed, with fault detectability and fault identifiability for rigorous analysis. Challenges, opportunities, and extensions are summarized with the intent to draw attention from the systems and control community and the process control community.", "Microgrid control: A comprehensive survey ": "Present researches in power and energy fraternity are driven towards the realization of smart grid (SG) technologies. Microgrids (MGs) being regarded as \u201celementary units\u201d of SG, has undergone rigorous research for more than one and a half decade now. It provides an integration platform for microsources (MSs), loads, storage devices and power electronics (PE) converters at demand premises forming a system of systems i.e. SoSs architecture. MGs mostly operated in grid-tied mode but during an emergency, are capable of standalone operation. Stability and operational control during both the modes are of utmost concern. Involvement of several control functionalities viz. normalcy of voltage and frequency, optimal power sharing, islanding detection etc., had been adhered in the literature. In spite of that, the real world implementation has not been of significant extent, that too even is far from having ideal MG characteristics, eligible for commercial usage. These technical obstacles need to be identified and dealt with. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of different control aspects of MGs, broadly classified under four control strategies: centralized, decentralized, distributed and hierarchical frameworks. Each scheme is reviewed in detail w.r.t the principles behind, their applicability and performances. It also identifies several research gaps and future trends therein. The technical barriers for real scale application and their solutions are also briefly discussed. And finally, a discussion on different integrated technologies for MGs, to realize SG features is also presented.", "A review on improving the autonomy of unmanned surface vehicles through intelligent collision avoidance manoeuvres ": "In recent years unmanned vehicles have grown in popularity, with an ever increasing number of applications in industry, the military and research within air, ground and marine domains. In particular, the challenges posed by unmanned marine vehicles in order to increase the level of autonomy include automatic obstacle avoidance and conformance with the Rules of the Road when navigating in the presence of other maritime traffic. The USV Master Plan which has been established for the US Navy outlines a list of objectives for improving autonomy in order to increase mission diversity and reduce the amount of supervisory intervention. This paper addresses the specific development needs based on notable research carried out to date, primarily with regard to navigation, guidance, control and motion planning. The integration of the International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea within the obstacle avoidance protocols seeks to prevent maritime accidents attributed to human error. The addition of these critical safety measures may be key to a future growth in demand for USVs, as they serve to pave the way for establishing legal policies for unmanned vessels.", "String stability for vehicular platoon control: Definitions and analysis methods ": "The platooning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is expected to have a transformative impact on road transportation, e.g, enhancing highway safety, improving traffic efficiency, and reducing fuel consumption. One critical task of platoon control is to achieve string stability, for which various models and methods had been proposed. However, different types of definitions and analysis methods for string stability were proposed over the years and were not thoroughly compared. To fill these gaps, this paper aims to clarify the relationship of ambiguous definitions and various analysis methods, providing a rigorous foundation for future studies. A series of equivalences are summarized and discussed. The pros and cons of different analysis methods and definitions are discussed, too. All these discussions provide insights for practical selection of analyzing methods for vehicle platoons.", "Challenges for the cyber-physical manufacturing enterprises of the future ": "This paper summarizes a vision of the challenges facing the so-called \u201cIndustry of the Future\u201d as studied by the research community of the IFAC Coordinating Committee 5 on Manufacturing and Logistics Systems, which includes four Technical Committees (TC). Each TC brings its own vision and puts forward trends and issues important and relevant for future research. The analysis is performed on the enterprise-level topics with an interface too other relevant systems (e.g., supply chains). The vision developed might lead to the identification of new scientific control directions such as Industry 4.0 technology-enabled new production strategies that require highly customised supply network control, the creation of resilient enterprise to cope with risks, developments in management decision-support systems for the design, and scheduling and control of resilient and digital manufacturing networks, and collaborative control. Cobots, augmented reality and adaptable workstations are a few examples of how production and logistic systems are changing supporting the operator 4.0. Sustainable manufacturing techniques, such closed-loop supply chains, is another trend in this area. Due to increasing number of elements and systems, complex and heterogeneous enterprise systems need to be considered (e.g., for decision-making). These systems are heterogeneous and build by different stakeholders. To make use of these, an environment is needed that allows the integration of the systems forming a System-of-Systems (SoS). The changing environment requires models which adapt over time. Some of the adaptation is due to learning, other mechanisms include self-organisation by intelligent agents. In general, models and systems need to be modular and support modification and (self-)adaptation. An infrastructure is needed that supports loose coupling and evolving systems of systems. The vision of the overall contribution from the research community in manufacturing and logistics systems, over the next few years is to bring together researchers and practitioners presenting and discussing topics in modern manufacturing modelling, management and control in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-based resilient and innovative production SoS and supply networks.", "Finite- and fixed-time convergent algorithms: Design and convergence time estimation ": "This paper presents a review of finite- and fixed-time convergent algorithms for dynamic systems of various dimensions and relative degrees, with or without disturbances. The review mainly focuses on finite- and fixed-time convergent algorithms, which provide explicit and easily computable upper estimates for the corresponding convergence times. The finite- and fixed-time convergent algorithms are classified according to their actions and structural properties: regulators, observers (differentiators), controllers; discontinuous and continuous, non-smooth and smooth, non-adaptive and adaptive. Some fixed-time convergent algorithms are illustrated by simulation examples displaying typical time histories of the state/estimate trajectories in each case.", "Solving a system of linear equations: From centralized to distributed algorithms ": "For a wide range of control engineering applications, the problem of solving a system of linear equations is often encountered and has been well studied. Traditionally, this problem has been mainly solved in a centralized manner. However, for applications related to large-scale complex networked systems, centralized algorithms are often subjected to some practical issues due to limited computational power and communication bandwidth. As a promising and viable alternative, distributed algorithms can effectively address the issues associated with centralized algorithms by solving the problem efficiently in a multi-agent setting that accords with the distributed nature of networked systems. Distributed algorithms decompose the entire problem into many sub-problems that are solved by individual agents in a cooperative manner. In this survey paper, we provide a detailed overview of the state of the art relevant to distributed algorithms for solving a system of linear equations. We will first review basic distributed algorithms including both discrete-time and continuous-time algorithms. Then we will discuss the extended algorithms to achieve communication efficiency. Furthermore, we will also introduce distributed algorithms to obtain the minimum-norm solution for a system of linear equations with multiple solutions, as well as the least-squares solution when there is no solution. Finally, the relationship of distributed algorithms for solving a system of linear equations to the existing distributed optimization algorithms is discussed.", "Review and big data perspectives on robust data mining approaches for industrial process modeling with outliers and missing data ": "Industrial process data are usually mixed with missing data and outliers which can greatly affect the statistical explanation abilities for traditional data-driven modeling methods. In this sense, more attention should be paid on robust data mining methods so as to investigate those stable and reliable modeling prototypes for decision-making. This paper gives a systematic review of various state-of-the-art data preprocessing tricks as well as robust principal component analysis methods for process understanding and monitoring applications. Afterwards, comprehensive robust techniques have been discussed for various circumstances with diverse process characteristics. Finally, big data perspectives on potential challenges and opportunities have been highlighted for future explorations in the community.", "Facility layout problems: A survey ": "Layout problems are found in several types of manufacturing systems. Typically, layout problems are related to the location of facilities (e.g., machines, departments) in a plant. They are known to greatly impact the system performance. Most of these problems are NP hard. Numerous research works related to facility layout have been published. A few literature reviews exist, but they are not recent or are restricted to certain specific aspects of these problems. The literature analysis given here is recent and not restricted to specific considerations about layout design.\n                  We suggest a general framework to analyze the literature and present existing works using such criteria as: the manufacturing system features, static/dynamic considerations, continual/discrete representation, problem formulation, and resolution approach. Several research directions are pointed out and discussed in our conclusion.", "Fundamental limitations and intrinsic limits of feedback: An overview in an information age ": "This paper presents a review on the fundamental performance limitations and design tradeoffs of feedback control systems, ranging from classical performance tradeoff issues to the more recent information-theoretic analysis, and from conventional feedback systems to networked control systems, with an attempt to document some of the key achievements in more than seventy years of intellectual inquiries into control performance limitation studies, as so embodied by the timeless contributions of Bode known as the Bode integral relations.", "Traffic state estimation on highway: A comprehensive survey ": "Traffic state estimation (TSE) refers to the process of the inference of traffic state variables (i.e., flow, density, speed and other equivalent variables) on road segments using partially observed traffic data. It is a key component of traffic control and operations, because traffic variables are measured not everywhere due to technological and financial limitations, and their measurement is noisy. Therefore, numerous studies have proposed TSE methods relying on various approaches, traffic flow models, and input data. In this review article, we conduct a survey of highway TSE methods, a topic which has gained great attention in the recent decades.\n                  We characterize existing TSE methods based on three fundamental elements: estimation approach, traffic flow model, and input data. Estimation approach encompasses methods that estimate the traffic state, based on partial observation and a priori knowledge (assumptions) on traffic dynamics. Estimation approaches can be roughly classified into three according to their dependency on a priori knowledge and empirical data: model-driven, data-driven, and streaming-data-driven. A traffic flow model usually means a physics-based mathematical model representing traffic dynamics, with various solution methods. Input data can be characterized by using three different properties: collection method (stationary or mobile), data representation (disaggregated or aggregated), and temporal condition (real-time or historical).\n                  Based on our proposed characterization, we present the current state of TSE research and proposed future research directions. Some of the findings of this article are summarized as follows. We present model-driven approaches commonly used. We summarize the recent usage of detailed disaggregated mobile data for the purpose of TSE. The use of these models and data will raise a challenging problem due to the fact that conventional macroscopic models are not always consistent with detailed disaggregated data. Therefore, we show two possibilities in order to solve this problem: improvement of theoretical models, and the use of data-driven or streaming-data-driven approaches, which recent studies have begun to consider. Another open problem is explicit consideration of traffic demand and route-choice in a large-scale network; for this problem, emerging data sources and machine learning would be useful.", "Environmental impacts of produced water and drilling waste discharges from the Norwegian offshore petroleum industry ": "Operational discharges of produced water and drill cuttings from offshore oil and gas platforms are a continuous source of contaminants to continental shelf ecosystems. This paper reviews recent research on the biological effects of such discharges with focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The greatest concern is linked to effects of produced water. Alkylphenols (AP) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from produced water accumulate in cod and blue mussel caged near outlets, but are rapidly metabolized in cod. APs, naphtenic acids, and PAHs may disturb reproductive functions, and affect several chemical, biochemical and genetic biomarkers. Toxic concentrations seem restricted to <2\u00a0km distance. At the peak of discharge of oil-contaminated cuttings fauna disturbance was found at more than 5\u00a0km from some platforms, but is now seldom detected beyond 500\u00a0m. Water-based cuttings may seriously affect biomarkers in filter feeding bivalves, and cause elevated sediment oxygen consumption and mortality in benthic fauna. Effects levels occur within 0.5\u20131\u00a0km distance. The stress is mainly physical. The risk of widespread, long term impact from the operational discharges on populations and the ecosystem is presently considered low, but this cannot be verified from the published literature.", "Plastics and microplastics in the oceans: From emerging pollutants to emerged threat ": "Plastic production has increased dramatically worldwide over the last 60 years and it is nowadays recognized as a serious threat to the marine environment. Plastic pollution is ubiquitous, but quantitative estimates on the global abundance and weight of floating plastics are still limited, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere and the more remote regions. Some large-scale convergence zones of plastic debris have been identified, but there is the urgency to standardize common methodologies to measure and quantify plastics in seawater and sediments. Investigations on temporal trends, geographical distribution and global cycle of plastics have management implications when defining the origin, possible drifting tracks and ecological consequences of such pollution. An elevated number of marine species is known to be affected by plastic contamination, and a more integrated ecological risk assessment of these materials has become a research priority. Beside entanglement and ingestion of macro debris by large vertebrates, microplastics are accumulated by planktonic and invertebrate organisms, being transferred along food chains. Negative consequences include loss of nutritional value of diet, physical damages, exposure to pathogens and transport of alien species. In addition, plastics contain chemical additives and efficiently adsorb several environmental contaminants, thus representing a potential source of exposure to such compounds after ingestion. Complex ecotoxicological effects are increasingly reported, but the fate and impact of microplastics in the marine environment are still far to be fully clarified.", "Microplastics in sediments: A review of techniques, occurrence and effects ": "Microplastics are omnipresent in the marine environment and sediments are hypothesized to be major sinks of these plastics. Here, over 100 articles spanning the last 50 year are reviewed with following objectives: (i) to evaluate current microplastic extraction techniques, (ii) to discuss the occurrence and worldwide distribution of microplastics in sediments, and (iii) to make a comprehensive assessment of the possible adverse effects of this type of pollution to marine organisms. Based on this review we propose future research needs and conclude that there is a clear need for a standardized techniques, unified reporting units and more realistic effect assessments.", "The behaviors of microplastics in the marine environment ": "Despite the pollution of microplastics being internationally recognized, the understanding of their behaviors in marine environment is still developing. Microplastics are ubiquitous in the marine environment, with the potential to cause harm to marine ecosystem. Here, we would classify the behaviors of microplastics as physical behaviors (i.e. migration, sedimentation and accumulation), chemical behaviors (i.e. degradation and adsorption) and biobehaviors (i.e. ingestion, translocation and biodegradation), and a further discussion on their behavioral mechanisms were presented to better understand their impacts for the marine environment.", "Experimental development of a new protocol for extraction and characterization of microplastics in fish tissues: First observations in commercial species from Adriatic Sea ": "The presence of microplastics in the marine environment has raised scientific interest during the last decade. Several organisms can ingest microplastics with potentially adverse effects on the digestive tract, respiratory system and locomotory appendages. However, a clear evidence of tissue accumulation and transfer of such microparticles in wild organisms is still lacking, partially hampered by technical difficulties in isolation and characterization protocols from biological samples. In this work, we compared the efficacy of some existing approaches and we optimized a new protocol allowing an extraction yield of microplastics from fish tissues ranging between 78% and 98%, depending on the polymer size. FT-IR analyses confirmed that the extraction procedure did not affect the particles characteristics. The method was further validated on the fish mullet, Mugil cephalus, exposed under laboratory conditions to polystyrene and polyethylene; the particles were isolated and quantified in stomach and liver, and their presence in the hepatic tissue was confirmed also by histological analyses. A preliminary characterization revealed the presence and distribution of microplastics in various fish species collected along the Adriatic Sea. FT-IR analyses indicated polyethylene as the predominant polymer (65%) in the stomach of fish. The overall results confirmed the newly developed method as a reliable approach to detect and quantify microplastics in the marine biota.", "Coral reef degradation affects the potential for reef recovery after disturbance ": "The loss of coral cover is often accompanied by an increase of benthic algae, a decline in biodiversity and habitat complexity. However, it remains unclear how surrounding communities influence the trajectories of re-colonization between pulse disturbance events. Over a 12-month field experiment in the central Red Sea, we examined how healthy (hard-coral dominated) and degraded (algae-dominated) reef areas influence recruitment and succession patterns of benthic reef foundation communities on bare substrates. Crustose coralline algae and other calcifiers were important colonizers in the healthy reef area, promoting the accumulation of inorganic carbon. Contrary, substrates in the degraded area were predominantly colonized by turf algae, lowering the accumulation of inorganic carbon by 178%. While coral larvae settlement similarly occurred in both habitats, degraded areas showed 50% fewer recruits. Our findings suggest that in degraded reefs the replenishment of adult coral populations is reduced due to recruitment inhibition through limited habitat complexity and grazing pressure, thereby restraining reef recovery.", "Impacts of anthropogenic disturbances at deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems: A review ": "Deep-sea hydrothermal-vent ecosystems have stimulated decades of scientific research and hold promise of mineral and genetic resources that also serve societal needs. Some endemic taxa thrive only in vent environments, and vent-associated organisms are adapted to a variety of natural disturbances, from tidal variations to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In this paper, physicochemical and biological impacts of a range of human activities at vents are considered. Mining is currently the only anthropogenic activity projected to have a major impact on vent ecosystems, albeit at a local scale, based on our current understanding of ecological responses to disturbance. Natural recovery from a single mining event depends on immigration and larval recruitment and colonization; understanding processes and dynamics influencing life-history stages may be a key to effective minimization and mitigation of mining impacts. Cumulative impacts on benthic communities of several mining projects in a single region, without proper management, include possible species extinctions and shifts in community structure and function.", "Natural and anthropogenic oil impacts on benthic foraminifera in the southern Gulf of Mexico ": "The Campeche Sound is the major offshore oil producing area in the Southern Gulf of Mexico (SGoM). To evaluate the impact of oil related activities in the ocean floor sediments, we analyzed the geochemical (major and trace element, organic carbon and hydrocarbon concentrations) and biological (benthic foraminifera) composition of 62 superficial sediment samples, from 13 to 1336\u202fm water depth. Cluster and Factor analysis of all the variables indicate that their distribution patterns are mainly controlled by differences between the terrigenous and carbonate platforms in the SGoM. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages were abundant and diverse, and their distribution patterns are mainly determined by water depth and sedimentary environment. However, most of the abundant species are opportunistic and/or low-oxygen tolerant, and many of their tests show oil stains and infillings, characteristic of oil polluted locations, suggesting the environment has been modified by natural seepage or oil-related activities. To determine if these conditions are natural or anthropogenic in origin, pre - industrial settings should be studied. Organic carbon (Corg) content (0.6\u20132.9%) and total hydrocarbon concentrations (PAHs 1.0\u201329.5\u202f\u03bcg\u202fkg\u22121) were usually higher around the oil platforms area, the natural hydrocarbon seeps (\u201cchapopoteras\u201d) area and offshore rivers, but there is no accumulation of oil related trace elements in these areas. However, the comparison with international sediment quality benchmarks indicates that Cd, Cr and Ni concentrations are above the threshold effect level, and also As, Ba and Cu are above the probable effect level benchmarks, which indicate that these element concentrations might be of potential ecological concern. Comprehensive studies involving different proxies, and assessing pre-industrial conditions, must be undertaken before assessing environmental health of marine benthic ecosystems.", "Histopathological assessment of liver and gonad pathology in continental slope fish from the northeast Atlantic Ocean ": "The deep-sea environment is a sink for a wide variety of contaminants including heavy metals and organic compounds of anthropogenic origin. Life history traits of many deep-water fish species including longevity and high trophic position may predispose them to contaminant exposure and subsequent induction of pathological changes, including tumour formation. The lack of evidence for this hypothesis prompted this investigation in order to provide data on the presence of pathological changes in the liver and gonads of several deep-water fish species. Fish were obtained from the north east region of the Bay of Biscay (north east Atlantic Ocean) by trawling at depths between 700 and 1400\u00a0m. Liver and gonad samples were collected on board ship and fixed for histological processing and subsequent examination by light microscopy. Hepatocellular and nuclear pleomorphism and individual cases of ovotestis and foci of cellular alteration (FCA) were detected in black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo). Six cases of FCA were observed in orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) (n\u00a0=\u00a050) together with a single case of hepatocellular adenoma. A wide variety of inflammatory and degenerative lesions were found in all species examined. Deep-water fish display a range of pathologies similar to those seen in shelf-sea species used for international monitoring programmes including biological effects of contaminants. This study has confirmed the utility of health screening in deep-water fish for detecting evidence of prior exposure to contaminants and has also gained evidence of pathology potentially associated with exposure to algal toxins.", "Imidacloprid and formulated product impacts the fatty acids and enzymatic activities in tissues of Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata\n             ": "The use of imidacloprid (IMI) and its formulated products in agriculture is a risk to aquatic organisms due to deposition into waterways from runoff and aerial spraying. However, there is limited information on the potential effects of this pesticide on commercially important shellfish, such as oysters. We investigated the impacts of IMI and Spectrum 200SC (IMI formulation) on the activity of the enzymes Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), Catalase (CAT) and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in different oyster tissues including the gill, adductor muscle and digestive gland. We also investigated the condition index and fatty acid composition of the flesh of oysters after 2 weeks exposure. The concentrations of IMI in the different tissues was assessed using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) after QuEChERS extraction. Higher concentrations of IMI residues were detected in the adductor muscle of the oysters, followed by the gills and with the lowest amounts recovered from the digestive gland across all the concentrations tested. IMI and Spectrum 200SC significantly affected the gill AChE activity at 2\u202fmg/L, but digestive gland CAT, and gill and digestive gland GST were impacted at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.01 and 0.05\u202fmg/L). In the whole oyster, 2 weeks exposure to IMI (\u22650.01\u202fmg/L) resulted in a proportional increase in saturated fatty acids (SFA), altered the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to SFA ratio and altered the omega 3 fatty acids (n-3) to omega 6 fatty acids (n-6) ratio, but there were no effects on the condition index of the oyster. Although the oysters responded differently to the formulated product, there was no consistent difference in the sublethal effects of analytical IMI and Spectrum 200SC. This study showed that exposure to IMI and Spectrum 200SC can significantly affect the biochemical processes and metabolites in oysters, with implications for food quality and safety.", "Changes in zooplankton communities from epipelagic to lower mesopelagic waters ": "Zooplankton form a trophic link between primary producers and higher trophic levels, and exert significant influence on the vertical transport of carbon through the water column (\u2018biological carbon pump\u2019). Using a MultiNet we sampled and studied mesozooplankton communities (i.e. >0.2\u202fmm) from six locations around Bermuda targeting four depth zones: \u223c0\u2013200\u202fm, \u223c200\u2013400\u202fm, \u223c400\u2013600\u202fm (deep-scattering layer), and \u223c600\u2013800\u202fm. Copepoda, our focal taxonomic group, consistently dominated samples (\u223c80% relative abundance). We report declines in zooplankton and copepod abundance with depth, concurrent with decreases in food availability. Taxonomic richness was lowest at depth and below the deep-scattering layer. In contrast, copepod diversity peaked at these depths, suggesting lower competitive displacement in these more food-limited waters. Finally, omnivory and carnivory, were the dominant trophic traits, each one affecting the biological carbon pump in a different way. This highlights the importance of incorporating data on zooplankton food web structure in future modelling of global ocean carbon cycling.", "Oyster disease in a changing environment: Decrypting the link between pathogen, microbiome and environment ": "Shifting environmental conditions are known to be important triggers of oyster diseases. The mechanism(s) behind these synergistic effects (interplay between host, environment and pathogen/s) are often not clear, although there is evidence that shifts in environmental conditions can affect oyster immunity, and pathogen growth and virulence. However, the impact of shifting environmental parameters on the oyster microbiome and how this affects oyster health and susceptibility to infectious pathogens remains understudied. In this review, we summarise the major diseases afflicting oysters with a focus on the role of environmental factors that can catalyse or amplify disease outbreaks. We also consider the potential role of the oyster microbiome in buffering or augmenting oyster disease outbreaks and suggest that a deeper understanding of the oyster microbiome, its links to the environment and its effect on oyster health and disease susceptibility, is required to develop new frameworks for the prevention and management of oyster diseases.", "Assessing the impact of introduced infrastructure at sea with cameras: A case study for spatial scale, time and statistical power ": "Detecting the effects of introduced artificial structures on the marine environment relies upon research and monitoring programs that can provide baseline data and the necessary statistical power to detect biological and/or ecological change over relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here we report on, and assess the use of, Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) systems as a technique to monitor diversity, abundance and assemblage composition data to evaluate the effects of marine renewable energy infrastructure on mobile epi-benthic species. The results from our five-year study at a wave energy development facility demonstrate how annual natural variation (time) and survey design (spatial scale and power) are important factors in the ability to robustly detect change in common ecological metrics of benthic and bentho-pelagic ecosystems of the northeast Atlantic. BRUV systems demonstrate their capacity for use in temperate, high energy marine environments, but also how weather, logistical and technical issues require increased sampling effort to ensure statistical power to detect relevant change is achieved. These factors require consideration within environmental impact assessments if such survey methods are to identify and contribute towards the management of potential positive or negative effects on benthic systems.", "Dangerous hitchhikers? Evidence for potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. on microplastic particles ": "The taxonomic composition of biofilms on marine microplastics is widely unknown. Recent sequencing results indicate that potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. might be present on floating microplastics. Hence, these particles might function as vectors for the dispersal of pathogens. Microplastics and water samples collected in the North and Baltic Sea were subjected to selective enrichment for pathogenic Vibrio species. Bacterial colonies were isolated from CHROMagar\u2122Vibrio and assigned to Vibrio spp. on the species level by MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation \u2013 Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry). Respective polymers were identified by ATR FT-IR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform \u2013 Infrared Spectroscopy). We discovered potentially pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus on a number of microplastic particles, e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene from North/Baltic Sea. This study confirms the indicated occurrence of potentially pathogenic bacteria on marine microplastics and highlights the urgent need for detailed biogeographical analyses of marine microplastics.", "Impact of crude oil and the dispersant Corexit\u2122 EC9500A on capelin (Mallotus villosus) embryo development ": "Marine food webs are particularly vulnerable to oil spills if keystone species are impacted. To quantify lethal and sublethal toxicity in a key Holarctic forage fish, capelin embryos were exposed to Hibernia crude oil water accommodated fraction (WAF) produced at an oil-to-water ratio of 1:9 (v:v) and chemically-enhanced WAF (CEWAF) produced with the dispersant Corexit\u2122 EC9500A at a dispersant-to-oil ratio of 1:10 (CEWAF H) or 1:50 (CEWAF L). Corexit alone yielded similar embryotoxicity to CEWAF. 10% CEWAF H, with total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of 99.2\u202f\u03bcg/L, decreased embryo survival following 10\u202fh of exposure, while continual exposed to 1% CEWAF L decreased hatching and heart rates. Concentrations down to 0.1% CEWAF L increased in a dose-dependent manner the transcript level of cytochrome P4501a1 (cyp1a1) in hatched larvae. These data indicate that embryo-larval survival of capelin is likely at risk if an oil spill coincides in space and time with spawning.", "Overview and trends of ecological and socioeconomic research on artificial reefs ": "It is presented a systematic literature review of artificial reef research, including 620 studies throughout the world from 1962 to 2018. The primary focus of this study was to examine long-term trends in research, focusing on ecological and socioeconomic questions, and to develop new research directions for this field. From 1962 to the beginning of the 1990s, the United States and Japan were the main centers of artificial reef research. Subsequently, researchers in several other countries (particularly China, Australia, Italy, Brazil, and the United Kingdom) began to focus on this subject, resulting in an increase in the number of artificial reef studies. In general, publications about artificial reefs have concentrated on investigating the structure of populations and marine communities and evaluating new technical designs and materials to construct artificial habitats. The science of artificial reefs is responding to new challenges with an increase in more elaborate techniques, such as the use of remotely-operated submarines, organic indicators, isotopes, and molecular biology, while research that evaluates the socioeconomic aspects of artificial reefs is lacking. There are many aspects that deserve more research attention, such as the use of alternative inert materials, environmental impact assessment and mitigation, and analysis of conflicts with affected fisheries communities. The greater challenge is to overcome the apparent division between theory vs. application and to include robust management models of these artificial environments.", "Inter-annual isotopic niche segregation of wild humboldt penguins through years of different El Ni\u00f1o intensities ": "The Humboldt Current System presents high interannual variability, influenced by the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), whose implications in wildlife are not fully understood. We studied the isotopic niche of wild Humboldt penguins at Punta San Juan (Peru) during the pre-moult foraging trip in 4 consecutive years (2008\u20132011) under known oceanographic (ENSO) conditions. Our results show that there is a clear isotopic niche segregation (on both \u03b413C and \u03b415N values) of wild Humboldt penguins among all years. Besides isotopic niche segregation, niche width also varied significantly among years. The larger isotopic niche displayed in 2008 reflected the opportunistic feeding behaviour of Humboldt penguins when oceanographic conditions were unfavourable (i.e. El Ni\u00f1o of strong intensity). In contrast, and despite strong segregation, penguins displayed a more specialist behaviour in years of mild environmental conditions (i.e. 2009 \u201cwarm-weak\u201d, 2010 \u201cneutral\u201d and 2011 \u201cwarm-moderate\u201d). No evidence of sexual segregation in wild Humboldt penguins during the pre-moulting foraging trip was found. This study highlights the coping mechanisms of an endangered species to changes in environmental conditions (i.e. overall, from strong to neutral El Ni\u00f1o events), which should have important ramifications in the management of the marine ecosystem in Peru, particularly the one related to the anchovy industry.", "Oceans and Human Health: A rising tide of challenges and opportunities for Europe ": "The European Marine Board recently published a position paper on linking oceans and human health as a strategic research priority for Europe. With this position paper as a reference, the March 2014 Cornwall Oceans and Human Health Workshop brought together key scientists, policy makers, funders, business, and non governmental organisations from Europe and the US to review the recent interdisciplinary and cutting edge research in oceans and human health specifically the growing evidence of the impacts of oceans and seas on human health and wellbeing (and the effects of humans on the oceans). These impacts are a complex mixture of negative influences (e.g. from climate change and extreme weather to harmful algal blooms and chemical pollution) and beneficial factors (e.g. from natural products including seafood to marine renewable energy and wellbeing from interactions with coastal environments). Integrated approaches across disciplines, institutions, and nations in science and policy are needed to protect both the oceans and human health and wellbeing now and in the future.", "Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environments: Evidence of emerged threat and future challenges for marine organisms ": "Pharmaceuticals are nowadays recognized as a threat for aquatic ecosystems. The growing consumption of these compounds and the enhancement of human health in the past two decades have been paralleled by the continuous input of such biologically active molecules in natural environments. Waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as a major route for release of pharmaceuticals in aquatic bodies where concentrations ranging from ng/L to \u03bcg/L are ubiquitously detected. Since medicines principles are designed to be effective at very low concentrations, they have the potential to interfere with biochemical and physiological processes of aquatic species over their entire life cycle. Investigations on occurrence, bioaccumulation and effects in non target organisms are fragmentary, particularly for marine ecosystems, and related to only a limited number over the 4000 substances classified as pharmaceuticals: hence, there is a urgent need to prioritize the environmental sustainability of the most relevant compounds. The aim of this review is to summarize the main adverse effects documented for marine species exposed in both field and laboratory conditions to different classes of pharmaceuticals including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, psychiatric, cardiovascular, hypocholesterolaemic drugs, steroid hormones and antibiotics. Despite a great scientific advancement has been achieved, our knowledge is still limited on pharmaceuticals behavior in chemical mixtures, as well as their interactions with other environmental stressors. Complex ecotoxicological effects are increasingly documented and multidisciplinary, integrated approaches will be helpful to clarify the environmental hazard of these \u201cemerged\u201d pollutants in marine environment.", "Microbial hitchhikers on marine plastic debris: Human exposure risks at bathing waters and beach environments ": "Marine plastic debris is well characterized in terms of its ability to negatively impact terrestrial and marine environments, endanger coastal wildlife, and interfere with navigation, tourism and commercial fisheries. However, the impacts of potentially harmful microorganisms and pathogens colonising plastic litter are not well understood. The hard surface of plastics provides an ideal environment for opportunistic microbial colonisers to form biofilms and might offer a protective niche capable of supporting a diversity of different microorganisms, known as the \u201cPlastisphere\u201d. This biotope could act as an important vector for the persistence and spread of pathogens, faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) and harmful algal bloom species (HABs) across beach and bathing environments. This review will focus on the existent knowledge and research gaps, and identify the possible consequences of plastic-associated microbes on human health, the spread of infectious diseases and bathing water quality.", "Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis spp.) as sentinel organisms in coastal pollution monitoring: A review ": "The blue mussel (Mytilus spp.) is widely used as a bioindicator for monitoring of coastal water pollution (mussel watch programs). Herein we provide a review of this study field with emphasis on: the suitability of Mytilus spp. as environmental sentinels; uptake and bioaccumulation patterns of key pollutant classes; the use of Mytilus spp. in mussel watch programs; recent trends in Norwegian mussel monitoring; environmental quality standards and background concentrations of key contaminants; pollutant effect biomarkers; confounding factors; particulate contaminants (microplastics, engineered nanomaterials); climate change; harmonization of monitoring procedures; and the use of deployed mussels (transplant caging) in pollution monitoring. Lastly, the overall state of the art of blue mussel pollution monitoring is discussed and some important issues for future research and development are highlighted.", "Changes in the biochemical and nutrient composition of seafood due to ocean acidification and warming ": "Ocean acidification and warming may threaten future seafood production, safety and quality by negatively impacting the fitness of marine species. Identifying changes in nutritional quality, as well as species most at risk, is crucial if societies are to secure food production. Here, changes in the biochemical composition and nutritional properties of the commercially valuable oysters, Magallana gigas and Ostrea edulis, were evaluated following a 12-week exposure to six ocean acidification and warming scenarios that were designed to reflect the temperature (+3\u00a0\u00b0C above ambient) and atmospheric pCO2 conditions (increase of 350\u2013600\u202fppm) predicted for the mid-to end-of-century. Results suggest that O. edulis, and especially M. gigas, are likely to become less nutritious (i.e. containing lower levels of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate), and have reduced caloric content under ocean acidification and warming. Important changes to essential mineral composition under ocean acidification and warming were evident in both species; enhanced accumulation of copper in M. gigas may be of concern regarding consumption safety. In light of these findings, the aquaculture industry may wish to consider a shift in focus toward species that are most robust to climate change and less prone to deterioration in quality, in order to secure future food provision and socio-economic benefits of aquaculture.", "Microplastics in the Mediterranean Sea: Deposition in coastal shallow sediments, spatial variation and preferential grain size ": "Marine litter loads in sea compartments are an emergent issue due to their ecological and biological consequences. This study addresses microplastic quantification and morphological description to test spatial differences along an anthropogenic gradient of coastal shallow sediments and further on to evaluate the preferential deposition of microplastics in a given sediment grain fraction. Sediments from Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) contained the highest concentrations of microplastics (MPs): up to 0.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10 MPs/g suggesting the transfer of microplastics from source areas to endpoint areas. In addition, a high proportion of microplastic filaments were found close to populated areas whereas fragment type microplastics were more common in MPAs. There was no clear trend between sediment grain size and microplastic deposition in sediments, although microplastics were always present in two grain size fractions: 2\u00a0mm\u00a0>\u00a0x\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0mm and 1\u00a0mm\u00a0>\u00a0x 0.5\u00a0mm.", "Large filter feeding marine organisms as indicators of microplastic in the pelagic environment: The case studies of the Mediterranean basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) ": "The impact of microplastics (plastic fragments smaller than 5\u00a0mm) on large filter feeding marine organisms such as baleen whales and sharks are largely unknown. These species potentially are ingesting micro-litter by filter feeding activity. Here we present the case studies of the Mediterranean fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) exploring the toxicological effects of microplastics in these species measuring the levels of phthalates in both species. The results show higher concentration of MEHP in the muscle of basking shark in comparison to fin whale blubber. These species can be proposed as indicators of microplastics in the pelagic environment in the implementation of Descriptor 8 and 10 of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).", "Climate change induced range shifts in seaweeds distributions in Europe ": "There are evidences of how climate change is affecting seaweeds distribution and the ecosystems services they provide. Therefore, it is necessary to consider these impacts when managing marine areas. One of the most applied tools in recent years to deal with this are species distribution models, however there are still some challenges to solve, such as the inclusion of hydrodynamic predictors and the application of effective, transferable and user-oriented methodologies.\n                  Five species (Saccorhiza polyschides, Gelidium spinosum, Sargassum muticum, Pelvetia canaliculata and Cystoseira baccata) in Europe and 15 variables were considered. Nine of them were projected to the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for the mid-term (2040\u20132069) and the long term (2070\u20132099). Algorithms for each species were applied to generate models that were assessed by comparison of probabilities and observations (area under the curve, true skill statistics, Boyce index, sensitivity, correct classification rate), niches overlap (Schoener's D, Hellinger's I), geographical similarity (interquartile range) and ecological realism.\n                  Models built demonstrated very good predictive accuracy and sensitivity, without overfitting risk. A medium overlap in the historical and RCPs environmental conditions were obtained, therefore the models can be considered transferable and results accurate because only some isolated points were detected as outliers, corresponding to low probabilities.\n                  The areas of S. polyschides and G. spinosum have been identified to be dramatically reduced, meanwhile S. muticum and C. baccata were predicted to expand their range. P. canaliculata was expected to keep its sites of presence but with a decrease in its probability of occurrence. For all species it was remarkable the importance of hydrodynamic variables and parameters representing extreme conditions. Spatially predictions of the potential species and areas at risk are decisive for defining management strategies and resource allocation. The performance and usefulness of the approach applied in this study have been demonstrated for algae with different ecological requirements (from upper littoral to subtidal) and distributional patterns (native and invasive), therefore results can be used by marine planners with different goals: marine protected areas designation, monitoring efforts guiding, invasions risk assessment or aquaculture facilities zonation.", "A quantitative model of water radiolysis and chemical production rates near radionuclide-containing solids ": "We present a mathematical model that quantifies the rate of water radiolysis near radionuclide-containing solids. Our model incorporates the radioactivity of the solid along with the energies and attenuation properties for alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), and gamma (\u03b3) radiation to calculate volume normalized dose rate profiles. In the model, these dose rate profiles are then used to calculate radiolytic hydrogen (H2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production rates as a function of distance from the solid\u2013water interface. It expands on previous water radiolysis models by incorporating planar or cylindrical solid\u2013water interfaces and by explicitly including \u03b3 radiation in dose rate calculations. To illustrate our model's utility, we quantify radiolytic H2 and H2O2 production rates surrounding spent nuclear fuel under different conditions (at 20 years and 1000 years of storage, as well as before and after barrier failure). These examples demonstrate the extent to which \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 radiation contributes to total absorbed dose rate and radiolytic production rates. The different cases also illustrate how H2 and H2O2 yields depend on initial composition, shielding and age of the solid. In this way, the examples demonstrate the importance of including all three types of radiation in a general model of total radiolytic production rates.", "Reliability of standardized uptake value normalized to lean body mass using the liver as a reference organ, in contrast-enhanced 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging ": "Purpose\n                  To evaluate the reliability of standardized uptake value (SUV) normalized to lean body mass for maximum (SULmax) and mean values (SULmean) as well as maximum SUV values (SUVmax) in contrast-enhanced 18F-FDG PET/CT by assessment of inter-reader agreement, using the liver as a reference organ.\n               \n               \n                  Materials and methods\n                  272 images of baseline PET/CT scans were analyzed. A volume of interest (VOI) of 30-mm in diameter was placed by two independent readers in the right liver lobe to measure the parameters. An analysis was performed for the variance, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots.\n               \n               \n                  Results and discussion\n                  For Reader 1, the SUVmax ranging from 1.33 to 5.94 (3.20 \u00b1 0.69), SULmean ranging from 0.84 to 3.46 (1.90 \u00b1 0.40) and SULmax ranging from 1.18 to 4.07 (2.38 \u00b1 0.50), were obtained; for Reader 2 the SUVmax ranging from 1.47 to 5.43 (3.20 \u00b1 0.70), SULmean ranging from 0.84 to 3.45 (1.90 \u00b1 0.40), and SULmax ranging from 1.18 to 4.48 (2.38 \u00b1 0.50), were obtained. The coefficient of variance for SUVmax, SULmean, and SULmax, were 21.9%, 21.1%, and 20.8%, respectively, having no significant differences between Reader 1 and Reader 2. The ICC of the two readers for SUVmax, SULmean and SULmax were 0.975, 0.982 and 0.977 (95% CI of 0.97, 0.98 and 0.97; p < .001) respectively. Bland-Altman plots revealed that SUVmax gave the best agreement with 97.1% of measurements falling within 2SD.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  There is an excellent inter-reader agreement for liver SUVmax, SULmean and SULmax, and the best reliability of measurements achieved with SULmax in contrast-enhanced PET/CT scans.", "Theory and calculation of the atomic photoeffect ": "The so-called elementary theory of the atomic photoeffect is presented in a form that is suited for practical numerical calculation of subshell cross sections and angular distributions of emitted photoelectrons. Atomic states are described within the independent-electron approximation, with bound and free one-electron orbitals that are solutions of the Dirac equation with the Dirac\u2013Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Slater self-consistent potential of the ground-state configuration. Detailed derivations are given of subshell cross sections for both excitation to discrete bound levels and ionization. In the case of ionization, the cross section differential in the direction of the photoelectron is obtained for partially polarized photons, with the polarization specified by means of the Stokes parameters. The theoretical formulas have been implemented in a computer program named photacs that calculates tables of excitation and ionization cross sections for any element and subshell. Numerical calculations are practicable for excitations to final states with the principal quantum number up to about 20 and for ionization by photons with energy up to about 2MeV. Elaborate extrapolation schemes for determining the subshell cross section for excitation to bound levels with larger principal quantum numbers and for ionization by photons with higher energies are described. The effect of the finite width of atomic energy levels is accounted for by convolving the calculated subshell cross-section with a Lorentzian profile.", "Insight into restructuring of Pd-Au nanoparticles using EXAFS ": "We acquired Pd K-edge and Au L3-edge EXAFS spectra of two libraries of titania-supported Pd-doped Au nanoparticle catalysts representing the as-prepared and post-catalysis state. The nanoparticles have narrow particle size distributions, in the range 2.8\u20136.6\u202fnm, and were synthesized to preferentially locate the palladium atoms on the surface of a gold core, with Pd mole fractions of 1.4\u201338%. EXAFS spectra of both the as-prepared samples and post-catalysis Pd-Au particles were collected and modeled. EXAFS refinement of all samples showed contributions from both Pd-Au and Pd-Pd scattering paths, revealing that Pd and Au components alloyed together. Pd was in a partially oxidized state as evidenced by a Pd-O scattering contribution, unlike Au. Overlaying measured coordination numbers from the libraries with predicted values, using models of surface and bulk alloying, showed that Pd restructures among Au as a result of exposure to the reaction conditions.", "Effect of gamma irradiation and its convergent treatment for control of postharvest Botrytis cinerea of cut roses ": "Postharvest diseases cause considerable losses to harvested crops. Among them, gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) is a major problem of exporting to cut rose flowers into Korea. Irradiation treatment is an alternative to phytosanitary purposes and a useful nonchemical approach to the control of postharvest diseases. Gamma irradiation was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity against B. cinerea on cut rose varieties, \u2018Shooting Star\u2019 and \u2018Babe\u2019. The irradiating dose required to reduce the population by 90%, D10, was 0.99kGy. Gamma irradiation showed complete inhibition of spore germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea, especially 4.0kGy in vitro. Antifungal activity of gamma irradiation on rose B. cinerea is a dose-dependent manner. A significant phytotoxicity such as bent neck in cut rose quality was shown from gamma irradiation at over 0.4kGy (p<0.05) in both varieties. Although there is no significant difference in both varieties for fresh weight, in the case of flower rate, \u2018Babe\u2019 shows more sensitivity than \u2018Shooting Star\u2019. In vivo assays demonstrated that established doses in in vitro, over 4kGy, could completely inactive fungal pathogens, but such high doses can cause severe flowers damage. Thus, to eliminate negative impact on their quality, gamma irradiation was evaluated at lower doses in combination with an eco-friendly chemical, sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) to examine the inhibition of B. cinerea. Intriguingly, only the combined treatment with 0.2kGy of gamma irradiation and 70ppm of NaDCC exhibited significant synergistic antifungal activity against blue mold decay in both varieties. Together, these results suggest that a synergistic effect of the combined treatment with gamma irradiation and NaDCC can be efficiently used to control the postharvest diseases in cut rose flowers, and will provide a promising technology for horticulture products for exportation.", "The mechanical, thermal and morphological properties of \u03b3-irradiated PLA/TAIC and PLA/OvPOSS ": "In the present work, various blend ratios of poly (lactic acid) (PLA), triallylisocyanurate (TAIC) and octavinyl-POSS (OvPOSS) were prepared by melt compounding in an Xplore microcompounder and molded by an Xplore microinjection molding device. POSS is a new generation organic/inorganic hybrid nanoparticle having possibility to improve the performance of polymers without sacrificing mechanical and thermal properties. TAIC and OvPOSS were used as crosslinking agents. After the compounding process, PLA, PLA/TAIC and PLA/OvPOSS composites were exposed to a gamma irradiation at various adsorbed doses ranging from 0 to 100\u202fkGy. The properties of neat PLA, PLA/TAIC and PLA/OvPOSS composites were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and tensile testing. Results showed that both chain scission reactions and formation of network structure occurred simultaneously after gamma irradiation. The highest gel formation was obtained from PLA composites including 3\u202fwt% OvPOSS at the dose of 100\u202fkGy. DSC results indicated that a sharp decrease in the degree of crystallinity (Xc%) of PLA in the presence of TAIC and OvPOSS was obtained after gamma irradiation process. All irradiated composites exhibited lower elongation at break and higher E-Modulus values at any irradiation doses. TGA results showed that irradiated samples were more thermally stable than the unirradiated ones. Moreover, the heat deflection temperature (HDT) of PLA in the presence of TAIC and OvPOSS was found higher than that of neat PLA. Brittle surface morphology of composites after gamma irradiation process was obtained from SEM analysis.", "Attenuation efficiency of X-ray and comparison to gamma ray and neutrons in composite metal foams ": "Steel\u2013steel composite metal foams (S\u2013S CMFs) and Aluminum\u2013steel composite metal foams (Al\u2013S CMFs) with various sphere sizes and matrix materials were manufactured and investigated for nuclear and radiation environments applications. 316L Stainless steel, high-speed T15 steel and aluminum materials were used as the matrix material together with 2, 4 and 5.2mm steel hollow spheres to manufacture various types of composite metal foams (CMFs). High-speed T15 steel is selected due to its high tungsten and vanadium concentration (both high-Z elements) to further improve the shielding efficiency of CMFs. This new type of S\u2013S CMF is called high-Z steel\u2013steel composite metal foam (HZ S\u2013S CMF). Radiation shielding efficiency of all types of CMFs was explored for the attenuation of X-ray, gamma ray and neutron. The experimental results were compared with pure lead and Aluminum A356, and verified theoretically through XCOM and Monte Carlo Z-particle Transport Code (MCNP). It was observed that the radiation shielding effectiveness of CMFs is relatively independent of sphere sizes as long as the ratio of sphere-wall thickness to its outer-radius stays constant. However, the smaller spheres seem to be more efficient in general due to the fine fluctuation in the gray value profile of their 2D Micro-CT images. S\u2013S CMFs and Al\u2013S CMFs are respectively 275% and 145% more effective for X-ray attenuation than Aluminum A356. Compared to pure lead, CMFs show adequate attenuation with additional advantages of being lightweight and more environmentally friendly. The mechanical performance of HZ S\u2013S CMFs under quasi-static compression was compared to that of other classes of S\u2013S CMF. It is observed that the addition of high-Z elements to the matrix of CMFs improved their shielding against X-rays, low energy gamma rays and neutrons, while maintained their low density, high mechanical properties and high-energy absorption capability.", "The reaction of coumarin with the OH radical revisited: hydroxylation product analysis determined by fluorescence and chromatography ": "Aqueous solutions of coumarin have been used to detect the hydroxyl radicals produced as a result of gamma radiolysis. Reverse-phase chromatography and fluorescence measurements show that the 7-hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone) is produced. The hydroxycoumarin isomers of 3OH-, 4OH-, 5OH-, 6OH- and 8OH-coumarin are also produced although the fluorescence emission of these products is negligible compared to that of 7-hydroxycoumarin. The radiation chemical yield of 7-hydroxycoumarin has been studied in different gas conditions.", "Synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles by ionizing radiation \u2013 a review ": "Various methods of nanoparticle syntheses using ionizing radiation exist nowadays. The synthesis often proceeds in aqueous solutions and therefore the core principle lies in the radiolysis of water and subsequent reactions of formed intermediates with dissolved compounds. There is a noticeable variety of inorganic nanoscale materials prepared by radiation methods, mostly using gamma or accelerated electron irradiation. This review summarizes the radiation induced syntheses of numerous nano-sized compounds, including metals, metal alloys and core-shell systems, metal oxides, carbonates, sulfides, etc., nanomaterials on supports, various heterostructures and nanocomposites. Many of these compounds feature various enhanced properties related to their small size, when compared to bulk materials. Size of the prepared particles vary from subnanometric to several tens of nm and the morphology can be fine-tuned by dose, dose rate and the composition of irradiated solutions.", "Food irradiation: Standards, regulations and world-wide trade ": "There is an established framework of international standards for food irradiation covering human health, plant protection, labelling, dose delivery, quality assurance and facility management. Approximately 60 countries permit irradiation of one or more food or food classes. National regulations are briefly reviewed. Decontamination of spices, herbs and condiments remains the single largest application of irradiation. However, in recent years the market for irradiated fresh and processed meat has become firmly established in several countries including China and the USA. At least 10 countries have recently established bi-lateral agreements for trade in irradiated fresh fruits and vegetables using phytosanitary irradiation. Irradiated fresh produce volumes now exceed 20,000t per year. Rationalization and greater consistency in labelling regulations would be advantageous to the future growth of applications of food irradiation.", "Optimizing vertical profile measurements setup of gamma ray attenuation ": ":\n               \n                  For undisturbed measurements of material properties, the gamma ray attenuation (GRA) method is a commonly used approach, e.g. in soil sciences. So far, various setups of the GRA method are applied depending on specific purposes. For accurate measurements, statistical error due to radioactive decay must be considered. In addition, a careful setting of the further involved parameters such as collimator size, the distance between source and detector as well as the measuring time need to be taken into account. In this study, a method to optimize GRA measurements is presented by relating measuring time and collimator selection to the statistical error of radiation. As a result, a method for choosing the optimum collimator size and a mathematical equation for optimizing the measuring time are derived, which is helpful for planning the vertical profile measurement in terms of required time and spatial resolution.", "Simultaneous hydrogel crosslinking and silver nanoparticle formation by using ionizing radiation to obtain antimicrobial hydrogels ": "Hydrogel dressings are crosslinked hydrophilic polymers able of swelling in presence of water and can be used in many different types of wound care. In turn, in wound care, silver has been used for a long time as an effective antimicrobial agent. Recent studies have demonstrated an increase of its antimicrobial action when it is used at nanometer scale, that is, as silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which have anti-inflammatory effect on infected wounds, rashes, and mesh skin grafts. The objective of this work was to study hydrogel dressings containing AgNPs from silver nitrate, synthesized by radiation involving the formation of silver nanoparticles with simultaneous occurrence of crosslinking and sterilization of the polymer systems. One of the hydrogels was prepared with poly(N-vinyl-2- pyrrolidone) (PVP) and the other with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as main studied polymers. An aqueous solution of AgNO3 was added to both polymer systems separately. The AgNPs synthesis, polymer crosslinking and dressing sterilization were achieved simultaneously by irradiating the resultant solutions with gamma-rays from a 60Co source. Gel fraction, swelling in reverse osmosis water, SEM-EDS, UV-visible spectroscopy, and antimicrobial activity were performed and characterized. The obtained results showed that the dressings have a soft consistency, high degree of crosslinking and swelling, homogeneous distribution of AgNPs with peaks of plasmonic bands about 400\u202fnm, but only PVP hydrogel showed antimicrobial properties to P. aeruginosa and normal S. aureus. Moreover, this hydrogel also showed antimicrobial properties to S. aureus strain multiresistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones, and aminoglycosides, whereas the PVA hydrogel showed antimicrobial properties to P. aeruginosa and bacteriostatic activity to S. aureus. The results suggest that both synthesized dressings have potential for use in wounds and burns infected with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.", "Photon energy response of LiF:Mg,Ti (MTS) and LiF:Mg,Cu,P (MCP) thermoluminescent detectors: Experimental measurements and microdosimetric modeling ": "The photon energy response of six thermoluminescent detector types (6LiF:Mg,Ti, 7LiF:Mg,Ti, natLiF:Mg,Ti, 6LiF:Mg,Cu,P, 7LiF:Mg,Cu,P and natLiF:Mg,Cu,P) was studied in the energy range 12\u20131250\u202fkeV by means of irradiations with different \u03b3-ray sources and X-rays. As expected, for both LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors, no significant differences were found between the results of detectors with same dopant concentrations but different lithium isotopic enrichment. On the other hand, the type and concentration of dopants influence the photon energy response of the detectors up to 50%. The obtained results were compared with experimental data from literature showing good agreement. In addition, the recently developed Microdosimetric d(z) Model was employed to assess the photon response of these detectors. For microdosimetric calculations performed in the optimal site size of 40\u202fnm (determined in previous investigations with charged particles), a very good agreement was observed between results of the model and the experimental data with an average relative deviation of 3% and 4% for LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors respectively.", "Construction and characterization of materials equivalent to the tissues and organs of the human body for radiotherapy ": "Treatment planning systems (TPS) give analytical results with very high dose gradients. For this reason, it is necessary to have solid equivalent materials that replace the different tissues and organs of the human body for different applications in Medical Physics. The objective of this work was to manufacture equivalent or alternative materials of some human body tissues such as: soft tissue (SOT), adipose tissue (ADT), lung tissue (LUT), bone tissue (BOT), muscle tissue (MUT), brain tissue (BAT), breast tissue (BET) and, organs such as: liver (LI), kidney (KI), bladder (BL), characterize them, determining their densities, mass attenuation coefficient (TMAC) and effective atomic number (Zeff). TMAC values were obtained from PENELOPE version 2014 code and, to determine the Zeff values, the Auto-Zeff version 1.7 software was used. The equivalent materials were prepared based on epoxy resin, mixed with phenolic microspheres, calcium carbonate and pulverized bull bone, obtaining non-malleable, non-degradable and non-toxic solid samples, which were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Density values ranging from 0.29\u202fg/cm3 for lung and, to 1.80\u202fg/cm3 for bone, were obtained in the characterization of these equivalent materials. Electron microscopy analysis does not detect the hydrogen percentage by weight in all the samples. For this reason, for TMAC validation, these percentage values were taken from the ICRU-44 report and other scientific database to be compared with the materials manufactured and analyzed by SEM. Under these conditions it was shown that the manufactured materials are equivalent to the ICRU report and other publications. The results indicate a maximum Average Percentage Difference (APD) of 1.64% for BL and, a minimum APD of 0.29% for BOT with respect to the TMAC ICRU values. For Zeff results, a good agreement was found for BOT and LUT with respect to other related works for energies from 0.1\u202fMeV to 20\u202fMeV.", "xTunes: A new XAS processing tool for detailed and on-the-fly analysis ": "A new X-ray absorption spectrum processing tool, xTunes, with a friendly graphical user interface was developed to handle large XAS data sets. It is written in Fortran and Visual Basic. xTunes can import XAS data and perform basic XAS processing, such as background subtraction, normalization, extraction of EXAFS oscillation, Fourier transform, etc. The main feature of xTunes is live data plotting of XAS data stored in a target directory, in real-time, with pre-processed XAS data parameters, to efficiently handle time-resolved data from quick XAFS measurement. It also integrates ATOMS code to generate FEFF input files and FEFF8.5\u202fL code for conventional EXAFS curve fitting analysis.", "Fabrication, characterization and gamma rays shielding properties of nano and micro lead oxide-dispersed-high density polyethylene composites ": "Polymer composites of high-density polyethylene (HD-PE) filled with powdered lead oxide nanoparticles (PbO NPs) and bulk lead oxide (PbO Blk) were prepared with filler weight fraction [10% and 50%]. These polymer composites were investigated for radiation-shielding of gamma-rays emitted from radioactive point sources [241Am, 133Ba, 137Cs, and 60Co]. The polymer was found to decrease the heaviness of the shielding material and increase the flexibility while the metal oxide fillers acted as principle radiation attenuators in the polymer composite. The prepared composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (BET) and field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM). The morphological analysis of the assembled composites showed that, PbO NPs and PbO Blk materials exhibited homogenous dispersion in the polymer-matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated that the thermal-stability of HD-PE was enhanced in the presence of both PbO Blk and PbO NPs. The results declared that, the density of polymer composites was increase with the percentage of filler contents. The highest density value was identified as 1.652gcm\u22123 for 50wt% of PbO NPs. Linear attenuation coefficients (\u00b5) have been estimated from the use of XCOM code and measured results. Reasonable agreement was attended between theoretical and experimental results. These composites were also found to display excellent percentage of heaviness with respect to other conventional materials.", "Surface modification of cellulose via conventional and controlled radiation-induced grafting ": "Cellulose, the most abundant natural polymer in the world has many desired properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, durability, low cost, etc. But it lacks some of the versatile properties of synthetic polymers like compatibility, melt-processability and solubility. To mitigate these drawbacks or to produce new sustainable products, chemical modification of cellulose becomes necessary in most cases. Introduction of synthetic polymers with specific properties onto cellulose via radiation-induced grafting is one of the key approaches to modify its physical and chemical properties. Utilizing reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods in radiation induced grafting may provide unique opportunities to tailor the surface properties of cellulose by controlling the graft length and architecture. Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) is of prime importance as it constitutes a bridge between nanoscience and natural cellulosic resources. The modification of this nanomaterial via radiation-induced grafting approach represents a striking potential to be explored by academy and industry. In this article it is intended to highlight the recent works on the modification of cellulose and nanocellulose via radiation-induced graft copolymerization by conventional and RDRP methods.", "Irradiation treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in water and wastewater: An overview ": "Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), especially the pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) such as antibiotics and hormones have attracted great concerns worldwide for their persistence and potential threat to ecosystem and public health. This paper presents an overview on the ionizing irradiation-induced degradation of PPCPs in aqueous solution. Parameters that affect PPCPs degradation, such as the absorbed dose, solution pH, dose rate, water matrices and the presence of some inorganic ions and humic acid are evaluated. The mechanism and pathways of radiolytic degradation of PPCPs are reviewed. In many cases, PPCPs such as antibiotics and X-ray contrast agent could be removed completely by radiation, but a higher absorbed dose was needed for their mineralization and toxicity reduction. The combination of ionizing irradiation with other methods such as H2O2, ozonation and TiO2 nanoparticles could improve the degradation efficacy and reduce the cost. Ionizing irradiation is a promising alternative for degradation of PPCPs in aqueous solution.", "Fluorescence detection of hydroxyl radicals ": "The hydroxyl radical (\n                        \n                     OH), a product of water radiolysis, reacts to hydroxylate aromatic organic compounds. In some cases, these hydroxylated products are fluorescent. Examples include the benzoate, coumarin, and phenoxazinone systems. For representative members of these systems, we have determined both the rate constants for reaction with \n                        \n                     OH and the yields of the fluorescent products. The rate constants all fall in the range 2\u00d7109 to 2\u00d71010\n                     Lmol\u22121\n                     s\u22121, and the yields 5\u201311% per \n                        \n                     OH. These results suggest that it may prove feasible to construct a probe consisting of two groups both of which must react with \n                        \n                     OH to become fluorescent. The efficient process of fluorescence resonance energy transfer implies that such a probe might be able to detect \n                        \n                     OH clusters, which are generally assumed to be a characteristic feature of energy deposition by ionizing radiation.", "Radiation shielding properties of polyimide composite materials ": "This work presents data on the possibility and perspectives of using bismuth silicate as a filler for a radiation\u2013shielding composite based on the polyimide matrix. The aim of this work was to experimentally estimate the protective characteristics of this polymer composite during the passage of electron energy (from 1 to 6\u202fMeV) and gamma ray energy (0.4\u202fMeV and 0.662\u202fMeV). For a larger range of energy, theoretical calculations for the passage of electrons and gamma radiation through the composite were used. The introduction of the proposed filler in an amount of 70\u202fwt% reduced the effective range of the electron by two times in the polyimide. The absorption coefficient of electrons in the proposed composite was much greater than the coefficient of reflection for electrons of the same energy. As the initial energy of the electron increases, the effect of their reflection decreases and the effect of their absorption increases. According to experimental data, the linear attenuation coefficients at 0.5\u202fMeV and 0.662\u202fMeV of energy were 0.87\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fcm\u20131 and 0.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202fcm\u20131, respectively. At an energy of 0.5\u202fMeV, the linear attenuation coefficient for the composite was 2.5 times and 1.4 times more than that of aluminum at an energy of 0.5\u202fMeV and 1\u202fMeV, respectively. The difference between the estimated and experimental data was small (around 8\u201311%), such that the calculated and the experimental results were in agreement.", "Qualitative soil mineral analysis by EDXRF, XRD and AAS probes ": "Soil minerals study is vital in terms of investigating the major soil forming compounds and to find out the fate of minor and trace elements, essential for the soil\u2013plant interaction purpose. X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been a popular technique to search out the phases for different types of samples. For the soil samples, however, employing XRD is not so straightforward due to many practical problems. In the current approach, principal component analysis (PCA) has been used to have an idea of the minerals present, in qualitative manner, in the soil under study. PCA was used on the elemental concentrations data of 17 elements, determined by the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) technique. XRD analysis of soil samples has been done also to identify the minerals of major elements. Some prior treatments, like removal of silica by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) slurry and grinding with alcohol, were given to samples to overcome the peak overlapping problems and to attain fine particle size which is important to minimize micro-absorption corrections, to give reproducible peak intensities and to minimize preferred orientation. A 2\u03b8 step of 0.05\u00b0/min and a longer dwell time than normal were used to reduce interferences from background noise and to increase the counting statistics. Finally, the sequential extraction procedure for metal speciation study has been applied on soil samples. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used to find the concentrations of metal fractions bound to various forms. Applying all the three probes, the minerals in the soils can be studied and identified, successfully.", "Development of in situ cell for simultaneous XAFS/XRD measurements at high temperatures ": "A novel in situ cell was developed for simultaneous X-ray absorption fine structure and X-ray diffraction (XAFS/XRD) measurements at high temperatures up to 1773\u202fK in a gas atmosphere such as air containing reactive oxygen, in which typical heat-resistant or environmental-barrier materials are used. This new cell can provide multimodal information by combining the following complementary information: (a) chemical states of a specific element and the short-range order (SRO) structure around the atoms, via XAFS measurements, and (b) the long-range order (LRO) crystal structure, via XRD. In situ observation of XAFS/XRD is essential to characterize materials under severe conditions, because reactions sometimes accompany metastable states, and quenching high-temperature states down to room temperature is quite difficult.\n                  The performance of the new cell was checked by in situ XAFS/XRD observation of the phase transition of TiO2 from anatase to rutile. Then, the developed technique was applied to a new type of environmental-barrier coating material, Yb2Si2O7, which was exposed to heat cycles up to 1773\u202fK in air. The bulk structure maintained the chemical state of Yb3+ and the crystal structure of Yb2Si2O7, and no reaction phase was observed. The developed technique could provide fundamental information to understand the behaviors of materials used at high temperatures.", "A new atomic database for X-ray spectroscopic calculations ": "The authors undertook to compile a database of recent values of the atomic parameters required for fundamental parameters (FP) calculation of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra, calculation of X-ray absorption in crystals and other samples, and correction of X-ray absorption spectra for self-absorption effects. All values were obtained from published sources and include the elements hydrogen (atomic number 1) through californium (atomic number 98). The data were collected into a single unstructured ASCII text file.", "The early history of food irradiation ": "Immediately after the discovery of ionizing radiation speculations arose to use it for therapeutic treatment and also for food preservation. However, at that time no radiation sources suitable for such applications had been available. With the development of (military) nuclear technologies suitable radiation sources became more and more available. This article narrates the many early ideas developed and the approaches taken. However, on the level of industrial exploitation of radiation processing of food, several such great ideas could not survive; some are still playing a niche role today as described in the respective articles. Nevertheless and today, radiation processing of food has become a standard technology world-wide.", "The Lisbon ranking for smart sustainable cities in Europe ": "There has recently been a conscious push for cities in Europe to be smarter and more sustainable, leading to the need to benchmark these cities\u2019 efforts using robust assessment frameworks. This paper ranks 28 European capital cities based on how smart and sustainable they are. Using hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA), we synthesized 32 indicators into 4 components and computed rank scores. The ranking of European capital cities was based on this rank score. Our results show that Berlin and other Nordic capital cities lead the ranking, while Sofia and Bucharest obtained the lowest rank scores, and are thus not yet on the path of being smart and sustainable. While our city rank scores show little correlation with city size and city population, there is a significant positive correlation with the cities\u2019 GDP per inhabitant, which is an indicator for wealth. Lastly, we detect a geographical divide: 12 of the top 14 cities are Western European; 11 of the bottom 14 cities are Eastern European. These results will help cities understand where they stand vis-\u00e0-vis other cities, giving policy makers an opportunity to identify areas for improvement while leveraging areas of strength.", "Recent challenges in modeling of urban heat island ": "The elevated air temperature of a city, urban heat island (UHI), increases the heat and pollution-related mortality, reduces the habitats\u2019 comfort and elevates the mean and peak energy demand of buildings. To countermeasure this unwanted phenomenon, a series of strategies and policies have been proposed and adapted to the cities. Various types of models are developed to evaluate the effectiveness of such strategies in addition to predict the UHI. This paper explains the compatibility of each type of model suitable for various objectives and scales of UHI studies. The recent studies, mainly from 2013 to 2015, are further categorized and summarized in accordance with their context of study.", "Towards sustainable smart cities: A review of trends, architectures, components, and open challenges in smart cities ": "Smart city is an application of Internet of Things (IoT) notion. Unceasing growth of population and urbanization have intensified innovative ways to handle urbanization with minimal impact on environment, citizen lifestyles, and governance. Initial integration of information communication technology (ICT) into city operations have promoted telicity, information city, and digital city concepts. Later, the conception of IoT has founded the smart cities, which support the city operations intelligently with minimal human interaction. Smart city emerged as a solution to address the challenges arise with exponential growth of urbanization and population. However, smart city concept is still evolving and not mainstreamed throughout the globe due to technological, economical, and governing barriers. Therefore, this paper aims to deliver the essence of smart cities. The paper presents a brief overview of smart cities, followed by the features and characteristics, generic architecture, composition, and real-world implementations of smart cities. Finally, we present some challenges and opportunities identified through extensive literature survey on smart cities.", "Case study of train-induced airflow inside underground subway stations with simplified field test methods ": "With the rapid development of subway construction in developing countries like China, energy conservation in subway stations is gaining popularity within society. Generally, ventilation and air-conditioning play important roles in the total energy consumption. As a major feature of subway stations, the train-induced airflow (TIA) driven by moving trains has been recognized for years, having a great influence on indoor environment and energy consumption. However, there is a lack of case study on real amount of train-induced airflow inside stations. In order to get extensive knowledge of the real situation, this paper proposes a set of simplified methods to measure and calculate train-induced airflow rates. Using these methods, field tests were conducted in several typical underground subway stations in China during the spring of 2016. This paper presents the basic situation of train-induced airflow in these stations and the influence of different ventilation modes. Based on the fact that there exists unneglectable amount of train-induced airflow, and considering the demand-supply analysis of fresh air, the potential for high levels of energy savings could be identified in the mechanical ventilation systems of these stations. These new findings are of great benefit for energy-efficient operation of existing stations.", "Modeling and forecasting building energy consumption: A review of data-driven techniques ": "Building energy consumption modeling and forecasting is essential to address buildings energy efficiency problems and take up current challenges of human comfort, urbanization growth and the consequent energy consumption increase. In a context of integrated smart infrastructures, data-driven techniques rely on data analysis and machine learning to provide flexible methods for building energy prediction. The present paper offers a review of studies developing data-driven models for building scale applications. The prevalent methods are introduced with a focus on the input data characteristics and data pre-processing methods, the building typologies considered, the targeted energy end-uses and forecasting horizons, and accuracy assessment. A special attention is also given to different machine learning approaches. Based on the results of this review, the latest technical improvements and research efforts are synthesized. The key role of occupants\u2019 behavior integration in data-driven modeling is discussed. Limitations and research gaps are highlighted. Future research opportunities are also identified.", "Smart parking in IoT-enabled cities: A survey ": "The rapid growth in population has led to substantial traffic bottlenecks in recent transportation systems. This not only causes significant air pollution, and waste in time and energy, but also signifies the issue of the auto-park scarcity. In the age of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city ecosystems, smart parking and relevant innovative solutions are necessary towards more sustainable future cities. Smart parking with the help of sensors embedded in cars and city infrastructures can alleviate the deadlocks in parking problems and provide the best quality of services and profit to citizens. However, several design aspects should be well investigated and analyzed before implementing such solutions. In this paper, we classify the smart parking systems while considering soft and hard design factors. We overview the enabling technologies and sensors which have been commonly used in the literature. We emphasize the importance of data reliability, security, privacy and other critical design factors in such systems. Emerging parking trends in the ecosystem are investigated, while focusing on data interoperability and exchange. We also outline open research issues in the current state of smart parking systems and recommend a conceptual hybrid-parking model.", "Smart sustainable cities of the future: An extensive interdisciplinary literature review ": "In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state\u2013of\u2013the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form\u2014with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context\u2013aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance\u2014given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of one\u2019s knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere.", "A comprehensive study of geothermal heating and cooling systems ": "Geothermal heat is an energy source that is local, reliable, resilient, environmentally-friendly, and sustainable. This natural energy is produced from the heat within the earth, and has different applications, such as heating and cooling of buildings, generating electricity, providing warm/cold water for agricultural products in greenhouses, and balneological use. Geothermal energy is not dependent on weather or climate and can supply heat and electricity almost continuously throughout the year. It may even be possible to use geothermal projects as \u201cthermal batteries\u201d, wherein waste or collected heat is stored for future use, even seasonal use, making geothermal energy \u201crenewable\u201d at a time scale of years. Extensive research has been carried out on different technologies and applications of geothermal energy, but comprehensive assessment of geothermal heating and cooling systems is relevant because of changing understanding, scale of application, and technology evolution. This study presents a general overview of geothermal heating and cooling systems. We provide an introduction to energy and the environment as well as the relationship between them; a brief history of geothermal energy; a discussion of district energy systems; a review of geothermal heating and cooling systems; a survey of geothermal energy distribution systems; an overview of ground source heat pumps; and, a discussion of ground heat exchangers. Recognition and accommodation of several factors addressed and discussed in our review will enhance the design and implementation of any geothermal heating or cooling system.", "The contribution of wood-based construction materials for leveraging a low carbon building sector in europe ": "Increasing the use of engineered wood products in the European Union can contribute to leveraging a shift towards a more emission-efficient production of construction materials. Engineered timber products have already been substituted for carbon and energy intensive concrete and steel-based building constructions, but they still lack the capacities and market demand to be more than just a niche market.\n                  However, in the post-crisis period after 2008 the consumption of engineered wood products began rising in Europe. In this paper we analyse options for the future development of engineered wood products taking into consideration policy barriers and technical and environmental potentials for accelerating market introduction as part of a comprehensive scenario approach. For the European building sector we assessed an achievable potential for net carbon storage of about 46 million tonnes CO2-eqv. per year in 2030. To unlock this potential a bundle of instruments is necessary for increasing the market share for engineered wood products against the backdrop of existing policy instruments such as the gradual introduction of stricter rules for carbon emissions trading or more incentives for the voluntary use of innovative wood construction materials.", "Vertical farming: Skyscraper sustainability? ": "It is predicted that the world population will reach 9 billion by 2050, of which 70% will live in urban centres. This change, alongside a changing climate, will strain Earth's resources, especially the food supply chain. One idea that has been proposed to address this issue is vertical farming \u2013 the urban farming of fruits, vegetables, and grains, inside a building in a city or urban centre, in which floors are designed to accommodate certain crops. While an interesting theoretical concept, no studies currently exist that quantify or qualify the validity of such an idea. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the feasibility and plausibility of the vertical farming concept from a socio technical, mixed methods, research perspective. This includes (1) examining how much energy is needed to power such a building and whether renewable energy can meet the onsite demands of the building by constructing a energy model, (2) quantifying the carbon footprint of vertically grown produce and subsequently comparing that to conventionally grown produce, and (3) conducting interviews to explore how relevant stakeholders perceive the concept of vertical farming in order to identify what are current barriers and opportunities exist towards possible uptake of the technology. The findings indicate that vertical farming is a tool that can be used to supply food to cities in a sustainable manner, but this depends on the location and design. Areas of future research are identified.", "A review and outlook for integrated BIM application in green building assessment ": "In the past decade, there has been a momentous increase in the use of Green Building Assessment Schemes (GBAS). Also, the contribution of BIM (Building Information Modelling) in evaluating GBAS criteria has been extensively recognized and is driving research on utilizing BIM to obtain GBAS credits. Although many green BIM studies have been published, there is a lack of a comprehensive and in-depth overview to synthesize the integration of BIM with GBAS. To fill this research gap, this paper presents a thorough and systematic review on the breadth of green building evaluation matrixes achievable with BIM. Great opportunities are identified in parametric analyses and optimizations of a holistic sustainable design approach by integrating GBAS with BIM. In addition, the study summarizes the development of comprehensive databases, data-rich models, data exchange protocols, assessment modules and output presentations. The results indicate urgent research needs in the following directions: automating the development of a database of manufacturer-certified elements; comprehensiveness of data exchange protocols; practical demonstration and detailed reporting of unaddressed assessment criteria in GBAS; exploration of cloud-based BIM and GBAS.", "A global comparison and assessment of incentive policy on electric vehicle promotion ": "Environmental issues and energy security have led governments to introduce lots of incentive policies on electric vehicle promotion. Benefiting from policy dividend, the global threshold of 1 million electric cars on the road had been exceeded in 2015, closing at 1.26 million. Among these incentive policies, subsidy scheme was regarded as the most important and effective. However, many governments intend to abrogate subsidy for electric vehicle, such as China, America and Germany. It`s worth finding out the key factors including incentive measures and additional socio-economic factors that promote electric vehicle adoption. Utilizing multiple linear regression method, we explore the relationship between those variables and 30 national electric vehicle market shares for the year 2015. The results show that chargers` density, fuel price and road priority are significantly positive factors correlated with a country`s electric vehicle market share. Nevertheless, fiscal incentives are no longer the reasons for the huge differences of electric vehicle promotion over countries. This paper is helpful for policymakers to adjust and improve their policy for electric mobility.", "Can cities become smart without being sustainable? A systematic review of the literature ": "Smart cities are widely seen as localities that actively embrace new technologies to achieve desired urban outcomes. Despite sustainability often claimed to be a desired outcome of smart city initiatives, little evidence exists how sustainability outcomes are incorporated or achieved within the smart city initiatives. This paper aims to address the question of whether cities can become smart without actually being sustainable. The study undertakes a systematic review of the smart and sustainable cities literature. The analysis highlights an expectation in the reviewed academic literature for cities to become sustainable first in order to be considered truly smart. The results point to major challenges of smart cities in delivering sustainable outcomes: (a) Smart city policies are characterised by heavy technocentricity; (b) Smart city practices involve complexities, and; (c) Smart city notions are conceptualised in an ad-hoc manner. The findings provide evidence that the current smart city practice fails to incorporate an overarching sustainability goal that is progressive and genuine. This, then, highlights the need for a post-anthropocentric approach in practice and policymaking for the development of truly smart and sustainable cities. The findings seek to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on this topic.", "Urban sustainability assessment framework development: The ranking and weighting of sustainability indicators using analytic hierarchy process ": "The consideration of local contexts in urban sustainability assessment is important for developing countries because of their varying needs and priorities. Using Iraq as a case study, a stakeholder-driven structured methodology is presented which identifies and ranks context-relevant indicators and assigns weights for aggregating indicator scores by applying analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Results indicate that the identified factors and their weights and priorities for Iraq were markedly different from the widely-used tools \u2014 suggesting that global tools are not directly applicable in developing countries. In contrast with the \u2018ecological\u2019 focus in the global assessment frameworks, economic and infrastructural aspects of urban development are of greater importance in developing countries. Decades of political instability and the resulting deterioration of infrastructures in Iraq are manifested in the related indicators being rated highly important by the stakeholders, and their corresponding high weighting in the developed Iraqi urban sustainability assessment framework (IUSAF). \u2018Water\u2019, \u2018safety\u2019, and \u2018transportation and infrastructure\u2019 indicators were awarded high weighting scores of 8.5%, 7.9% and 7.8%, respectively. IUSAF is envisaged to play a key role in the promotion of built environment sustainability in Iraq by stimulating market demand for sustainable buildings, cities and conurbations.", "Water conservation through rainwater harvesting using different building forms in different climatic regions ": "Rainwater harvesting on buildings is directly related with water collection surfaces and thus with the building form. In this study, the amount of rainwater obtained using different building forms in different climatic regions were analysed comparatively. Two scenarios were used in this study.\n                  In the first scenario, 2 different public housing developments with different building forms and roof styles but with same occupant numbers and same site area in Bursa in the temperate-humid climate region and Diyarbakir in the hot-dry climate region were evaluated in relation to rainwater collection and water conservation. In the second scenario, a typical project developed by TOK\u0130 for the temperate climate region was also applied to the hot-dry climatic region and the amount of collected rainwater was evaluated taking into account also the characteristics of climatic region.\n                  The study found that in the first scenario 18% and 7%, and in the second scenario 13% and 5% of annual water consumption only in toilet flushing and bathrooms respectively (toilet flushing, sinks and bathtubs) was met by collected rainwater in Development 1. These values were 34% and 13% respectively for Development 2.", "Developing a social sustainability assessment framework ": "Green building appraisal tool evaluates, enhance and promote the level of sustainable development in the built environment. However, with a focus on the social criteria, the context of the building assessment tool has remained unexamined. Moreover, since a large number of green building evaluation tool, has been established throughout the years, there is by all accounts a significant lacuna in the classification and estimation of the investigation of social criteria in building assessment tools. Therefore, the study aims at developing a social criteria framework, supported by categories and indicators to evaluate sustainable development in buildings. The set of categories and indicators were proposed based on the adoption of LEED working sheet. Against the background, the study is organized by adopting Delphi techniques and interviews for building users. In doing so, a two-round questionnaire was responded to by qualified experts to help in the selection of key categories and indicators that support the evaluation of social criteria for GBAT. Also, the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process was employed to find the most relevant measurement and weight for the resulting indicators and categories. The findings will contribute to building practitioners in order to evaluate building projects socially, with a focus to attain sustainable development in the built environment.", "Biodiesel production from waste cooking oil: An efficient technique to convert waste into biodiesel ": "Biodiesel production from waste oils is an attractive option to produce biodiesel economically, but high free fatty acids (FFA) in waste oils are a serious bottleneck for the process of transesterification. Present investigation deals with the utilization of waste cooking oil (WCO) for the production of biodiesel. The acid value of WCO was 5.5\u202fmg KOH/g which indicated high FFA content. The WCO was subjected to esterification using different acid catalysts (HCl, H2SO4 and H3PO4) and H2SO4 catalyzed reaction was found to be the most efficient since the FFA reduced up to 88.8% at 60\u202f\u00b0C with 1:2.5 methanol to oil molar ratio. Transesterification was done in the presence of alkali catalyst (KOH) and Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield was 94% in the presence of 1% catalyst at 50\u202f\u00b0C. The biodiesel was characterized based on acid value, saponification value, iodine value, cetane number, specific gravity, viscosity, cloud point, pour point and calorific value. The Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis of synthesized biodiesel was also performed. Base on ASTM standards, alkali catalyzed transesterification was an efficient method to produce biodiesel form WCO. Results revealed that the waste cooking oils can be converted into biodiesel as an energy source along with environmental pollution reduction.", "Towards smart sustainable cities: A review of the role digital citizen participation could play in advancing social sustainability ": "The notion of smart cities needs to be broadened beyond the fascination with technology to incorporate an approach that invests in the growth of human, social, and environmental capitals to generate \u2018smart sustainable cities\u2019. One of the most recent debates in this context is digital citizen participation. This study aimed to identify the potential role of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in citizen participation as a major contributor towards \u2018smart sustainable cities\u2019. A systematic and exhaustive literature review, coupled with critical content analysis, was conducted. The focus was on a central research question: What kind of relationship is fostered in the literature between sustainability and digital citizen participation, and how can ICT contribute to social sustainability through digital citizen participation (DCP)? The results suggested a connection between smart sustainable cities and DCP. This article is concluded by emphasizing the role of ICT in citizen participation processes and its significant contribution to social sustainability and the creation of more-than-human smart cities.", "Implications of climate changes to building energy and design ": "Climate change is a widely acknowledged major environmental problem whose impacts on building energy use however are not fully understood. Various climate models have been developed and used to project climate changes; however most of existing studies on climate change impacts only use few model outcomes, providing narrow predictions on the influences. This study analyzed a large number (i.e., 56) of models and scenarios. The obtained future climate data showed a wider range of potential changes and thus impacts on building energy. Four reference climate models were identified to cover the full range of the 56 models for three time periods and seven climate zones. The accuracy of model projections was validated using historical data. The study predicted the potential energy implications of climate changes to a campus building stock. Influences of these changes on utility and economics were analyzed. The study further explored the potential impacts of climate change to the current climate zones that directly relate to building energy consumption.", "Ancile: Privacy-preserving framework for access control and interoperability of electronic health records using blockchain technology ": "Despite an increased focus on the security of electronic health records and an effort by large cities around the globe to pursue smart city infrastructure, the private information of patients is subject to data breaches on a regular basis. Previous efforts to combat this have resulted in data being mostly inaccessible to patients. Existing record management systems struggle with balancing data privacy and the need for patients and providers to regularly interact with data. Blockchain technology is an emerging technology that enables data sharing in a decentralized and transactional fashion. Blockchain technology can be leveraged in the healthcare domain to achieve the delicate balance between privacy and accessibility of electronic health records.\n                  In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based framework for secure, interoperable, and efficient access to medical records by patients, providers, and third parties, while preserving the privacy of patients\u2019 sensitive information. Our framework, named Ancile, utilizes smart contracts in an Ethereum-based blockchain for heightened access control and obfuscation of data, and employs advanced cryptographic techniques for further security. The goals of this paper are to analyze how Ancile would interact with the different needs of patients, providers, and third parties, and to understand how the framework could address longstanding privacy and security concerns in the healthcare industry.", "Urban resilience: A conceptual framework ": "Nowadays, natural disasters and human actions are considered uncertain, unpredictable urban threats. Therefore, cities must respond more quickly and more effectively to anticipate and minimize the associated consequences and dangers. Promoting urban resilience in relation to environmental, socioeconomic and political domains has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers and local authorities. Thus, this article reviewed the scientific and technical literature about urban resilience highlighting its definitions, dimensions, application areas, characteristics and challenges and opportunities. Considering these topics, the aim of this work was to create a systematic approach and a clear view about urban resilience for building and strengthening cities against new disturbances. It was concluded that urban resilience is based on four basic pillars: resisting, recovering, adapting and transforming. Urban resilience can also be divided in five dimensions: natural, economic, social, physical and institutional. Additionally, urban resilience evaluation models integrate eleven characteristics: redundancy, robustness, connectivity, independence, efficiency, resources, diversity, adaptation, innovation, inclusion and integration. Finally, it was concluded that there are a lack of tools and methods to evaluate resilience providing a main challenge and opportunity for developing future holistic studies about urban resilience, allowing the identification of the most effective measures to increase resilience of different urban systems.", "Demand side management in smart grid: A review and proposals for future direction ": "This paper mainly focuses on demand side management and demand response, including drivers and benefits, shiftable load scheduling methods and peak shaving techniques. Demand side management techniques found in literature are overviewed and a novel electricity demand control technique using real-time pricing is proposed. Currently users have no means to change their power consumption to benefit the whole system. The proposed method consists of modern system identification and control that would enable user side load control. This would potentially balance demand side with supply side more effectively and would also reduce peak demand and make the whole system more efficient.", "Towards the next generation of green building for urban heat island mitigation: Zero UHI impact building ": "At present, cities are under the threats of global warming and urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, where buildings are an important cause and also the sufferer of urban overheating. Therefore, building, especially the green building (GB), is predominantly provisioned to address the increasing energy consumption and carbon emissions in response to climate change, while to our best knowledge, it has been scarcely requested for UHI mitigation (UHIM). Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of GB-based UHIM system, or \u2018zero UHI impact building\u2019, or \u2018zero-heat building\u2019 or \u2018microclimate neutral building\u2019, aiming to achieve the zero-heat impact on surrounding environments through reasonably designing and operating buildings, or depending on innovative techniques to eliminate the excessive heats, on the basis of GB\u2019s goals. In specific, this paper defines the boundary of the GB-based UHIM system, analyzes the interactions between building and urban heat fluxes, and the factors that may affect the use of UHIM techniques on building components. The potentials to establish the GB-based UHIM system are further analyzed in aspects of the UHI impacts on the GB benefits and the principle for heat mitigation. Moreover, the pathway to GB-based UHIM system implementation is further elaborated and suggestions for future direction and work are given. Overall, this paper presents the theoretical and practical foundation for the establishment of GB-based UHIM system and it is a significant move of building sector in response to the temperature increase.", "Waste heat from data centers: An investment analysis ": "The growth of computing and Internet use have attracted the attention of the general public concerning the carbon footprint of data centers (DCs). Previous research has focused on the implementations of energy efficiency activities. However, little research has been published on the economic evaluation of waste heat utilization in the DC industry. This paper aims to provide an economic investment assessment of DC waste heat utilization. The contribution of this paper is the assessment of three different sized cases with realistic input factors affecting the net present value (NPV) model. We contribute to the ongoing discussion on the energy efficiency of DCs and provide a transparent assessment model for DC and district heating operators. We identified the positive NPV cases with high probability. The medium case has an NPV of 1.04 M\u20ac (with uncertainty, the results range from \u22120.332 M\u20ac to 2.57 M\u20ac). The large case has an NPV of 16.3 M\u20ac (with uncertainty, the results range from 4.1 M\u20ac to 30.2 M\u20ac). Both of these are clear-cut waste heat utilization investment proposals. The small case NPV is \u221248.5 k\u20ac (with uncertainty, the results range from \u2212264 k\u20ac to 143 k\u20ac). The small case is sensitive to input factor values.", "The IoT for smart sustainable cities of the future: An analytical framework for sensor-based big data applications for environmental sustainability ": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.", "Measuring the plasticity of clays: A review ": "Plasticity is the outstanding property of clay\u2013water systems. It is the property a substance has when deformed continuously under a finite force. When the force is removed or reduced, the shape is maintained. Mineralogical composition, particle size distribution, organic substances and additives can affect the plasticity of clays. Several measuring techniques and devices were proposed to determine the optimal water content in a clay body required to allow this body to be plastically deformed by shaping. In this review, methods of evaluating the plasticity of clay\u2013water systems are presented. Despite the advance in the theory of the plasticity and the methods of measurement, a common procedure for all types of materials does not exist. The most important methods are those that simulate the conditions of real processing.", "Layered double hydroxides: A brief review from fundamentals to application as evolving biomaterials ": "Layered double hydroxides (LDH) which are one type of layered materials and are also known as anionic clays, are promising layered materials due to some of their interesting properties, such as ease of synthesis, unique structure, uniform distribution of different metal cations in the brucite layer, surface hydroxyl groups, flexible tunability, intercalated anions with interlayer spaces, swelling properties, oxo-bridged linkage, and high chemical and thermal stability, ability to intercalate different type of anions (inorganic, organic, biomolecules, and even genes), delivery of intercalated anions in a sustained manner and also high biocompatibility. Considering the previous work on LDH as novel biomaterials, research on this particular materials has become one of the most interesting topic of today's research. LDH has become an important class of layered materials having prospects in the field of biomaterials, wherein great attention has been paid to the biocompatibility nature, exchange of the existing anion with the target anion, holding of guest species in between the interlayer space and its controlled release of the anion in a particular medium. This article, after deliberating the recent significant evolution in the structure and different methods of synthesis of different LDH materials and its applications in various extents especially its biological applications through their structural and functional properties, considers many typical examples. In particular, recent progress on the emerging strategies of LDH to improve their antimicrobial activity is also presented.", "Removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions by adsorption using single and mixed pillared clays ": "This work concerns the application of single and mixed pillared clays in adsorption of inorganic pollutant in the water: the cadmium, the cobalt, and the copper. Adsorption experiments were conducted under various conditions, i.e., pH, contact time, initial concentration, and temperature. A comparison of the adsorption of the three metals onto pillared clays and natural clays suggested that pillared clays had higher adsorption affinity for metals than the unpillared clays. The experimental results indicated that the pillared clays rich on cerium show better properties on Cd2+, Co2+, and Cu2+ adsorption than those without cerium, which made them the promising recycling metals adsorbents. The equilibrium isotherm data were analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations. In all cases, the adsorption process fitted the second-order kinetics well, and the isotherm equation due to Langmuir showed good fits with the experimental data.", "Interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals: New insights and broader applications ": "Interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals are ubiquitous in nature and are involved in the formation and transformation of clay minerals and the global cycles of many elements. The fungi/actinomyces in microbes are also associated with clay minerals, but bacteria are more widely linked. These interactions are also involved in the adsorption and fixation of heavy metals and the decomposition of organic pollutants in soil. Knowledge of these interactions can be utilised for the refinement and purification of clay minerals in industry. This review provides an overview of recent studies and obtains insights into the interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals. Microorganisms can induce the nucleation and growth of clay minerals. The metabolism of microorganisms can also degrade and transform clay minerals. The interaction between microorganisms and clay minerals promots the transformation of smectite to illite (S-I) and vice versa (I-S). Such interactions significantly contribute to the global cycles of various elements, such as Al, Si, Mg, Fe, P, S, C, and N. Microorganisms and clay minerals can form complexes and composite materials that adsorb heavy metals such as Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn, Co, Ni, Ag, and Hg. Microorganism adhesion to clay minerals is involved in the synergistic adsorption and decomposition of organic pollutants in soil and water. This literature review indicates that knowledge of the interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals has been significantly deepened over recent years. However, the interaction between microorganisms and clay minerals under natural geological conditions and the inherent mechanisms involved are not yet well understood. Future work on interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals has great implications for handling atmospheric micro/nano particle pollutants, understanding the formation, alteration and diagenesis of clay minerals and other related minerals, tracking primitive life on Earth and exploring extraterrestrial planets.", "Properties and applications of halloysite nanotubes: recent research advances and future prospects ": "Halloysite is a natural nanosized tubular clay mineral that has many potentially important uses in different industrial fields. In this paper, the key structural characteristics and properties of halloysite and their related applications are comprehensively reviewed. Research advances on halloysite, especially those from the past 20years, are summarized with some critical comments. Attention is mainly paid to the structure and morphology of halloysite and their changes, the formation of tubular structures, the physicochemical properties, the surface chemical modifications, and the halloysite-based advanced materials and some related applications. Additionally, future prospects and key problems to be solved in halloysite studies are discussed. This review shed new light on both fundamental and applied studies that focused on halloysite.", "Layered double hydroxide based bionanocomposites ": "Layered double hydroxides (LDH), also identified as anionic clays, have attracted much consideration due to their excellent ion exchange capacities, shape memory effect and ability to intercalate anions. LDH have been used in the different fields of applications such as biomedical, sensors and detectors, energy storage, novel and advanced functional materials etc. On other hand, biopolymers are environment friendly, fully degradable and sustainable materials, so they can be easily composed without harming nature. Degradation of biopolymers involves loss of structural, mechanical and chemical properties of the polymer and converting into biodegradable compounds which are helpful to the environment. Thus, bionanocomposites made from LDH and different biopolymers would have synergistic effect on their properties, which are necessary for actual applications. This review article deals with the preparation, properties and applications of bionanocomposites made from LDH and biopolymers such as heparin, deoxyribose nucleic acid, vitamin C and E, cellulose, chitosan, polylactic acid, different anionic biopolymers and starch.", "Alkali activation behaviour of un-calcined montmorillonite and illite clay minerals ": "Using alkali activation, un-calcined soils have potential as precursors for low carbon, low cost, geopolymer-stabilised construction materials. This technology has been recently promoted as a lower impact alternative to cement stabilisation for walling materials in construction around the world. There is a lack of fundamental understanding around the alkali activation of un-calcined montmorillonite and illite, which, along with kaolinite, are clay minerals commonly found in soils. Kaolinite, as a 1:1 clay mineral, has been shown to form crystalline hydrosodalite when alkali-activated, but 2:1 montmorillonite and illite could form stronger geopolymer structures due to the higher Si:Al ratio in the precursor mineral. The lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms at work with 2:1 clay minerals is a barrier to knowing how viable un-calcined geopolymer stabilised soil materials are for the range of soil types found in nature. In this study, montmorillonite and illite precursors were activated with a range of sodium hydroxide concentrations, compacted, and then cured at 80\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh. The cured samples were characterised using a variety of advanced analytical techniques, including powder XRD, SEM, TGA, 27Al and 29Si-MAS-NMR, and FTIR. For the first time it was confirmed that alkali activation of uncalcined montmorillonite forms a NASH or (N,C)ASH geopolymer as the major product phase, which increases in quantity with increasing Na:Al molar ratio of the system. Although it has a similar Si:Al ratio, alkali activation of illite seems to result in structural alteration and increased porosity for Na:Al\u202f\u2265\u202f0.5. The behaviour of these individual clay minerals suggests that the alkali activation of un-calcined 2:1 clay minerals is complex. Although alkali activation of montmorillonite can form a geopolymer, alkali activation of soils containing illite may lead to poor quality materials. This research has shown that the focus of future development work should be around montmorillonite-based clays.", "Keggin-Al30: An intercalant for Keggin-Al30 pillared montmorillonite ": "Clay minerals intercalated with inorganic species, known as pillared interlayered clays, have received extensive attention in recent decades. In this work, by comparison with those of Keggin-Al13, the formation processes of Keggin-Al30 are discussed based on different hydrolysis reactions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscope, and thermogravimetric analyses were applied to compare differences in crystal structure, morphology, and thermal stability between Keggin-Al13 and Keggin-Al30 (sulfates). High temperature and excess monomeric Al species are key factors controlling the transformation from \u03b5-Keggin-Al13 to \u03b4-Keggin-Al13 and finally to Keggin-Al30. A decrease of the crystal symmetry from Keggin-Al13 to Keggin-Al30 was confirmed by shifts of reflections (and decreases of intensities) on XRD patterns. Keggin-Al30 has a more compact structure, which leads to higher thermal stability. The distributions of functional groups and positive charges on the surface of Keggin-Al30 result in a \u201clying flat\u201d arrangement configuration in the interlayer region of montmorillonite. Exploring the behaviors of polycations as intercalants from their formation, transformation, and properties during the pillaring process may offer better understandings of the enhanced properties and wide applications of pillared interlayered clays.", "Exfoliation of montmorillonite and related properties of clay/polymer nanocomposites ": "Exfoliating montmorillonite (Mt) to nanolayers is a crucial step during producing clay/polymer nanocomposites(CPN). Only well-exfoliated and well-dispersed Mt. nanolayers in the polymer matrix can significantly improve the properties of the nanocomposites. This review examines the latest scientific advances in the exfoliation methods of Mt., the insights into the exfoliation mechanisms, and the peculiar functionalities of the resultant CPN. The direct exfoliation of Mt. dispersed in water or organic solvents is often intensified by ultrasonication. Grinding of Mt. in the form of solid in a high-energy ball mill can directly exfoliate Mt. to some extent. Exfoliating Mt. for producing CPN is mainly achieved through so-called in situ exfoliation, solution exfoliation and melt exfoliation. The Mt./polymer nanocomposites exhibit typically improved barrier properties, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and fire retardancy. The literature survey suggests that future work should place emphases on developing green and effective exfoliation methods, and deepening understanding of exfoliation mechanisms and the interfacial interactions between the inorganic Mt. nanolayers and organic monomers/polymers. Future research is suggested to assembling exfoliated Mt. nanolayers with functional polymeric molecules or other nano-scale building blocks to produce functional hierarchical nanomaterials with practical applications.", "Adsorption of propranolol onto montmorillonite: Kinetic, isotherm and pH studies ": "The objective of this study was to explore the potential use of the smectite clay mineral montmorillonite (Mt) as adsorbent in the removal of water containing the emerging compound propranolol. The Mt was deeply characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Zeta potential and thermogravimetric analysis (DSC-TG), before and after adsorption experiments, and their isotherms and kinetic models were fitted to assess the adsorption of propranolol.\n                  The incorporation of propranolol in the interlayer was demonstrated by XRD and DSC-TG. The results obtained by Zeta potential indicated no adsorption of propranolol in the surface. Kinetic of propranolol adsorption onto Mt. was evaluated using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intra-particle diffusion and Elovich models. Pseudo-second order was the kinetic model that best described the adsorption of propranolol (R2\u202f>\u202f0.999). It was possible to obtain a removal efficiency of approximately 96% in <1\u202fmin. The adsorption equilibrium isotherm was fitted with the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevitch mathematical models to obtain the respective parameters. Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevitch were the models that best fitted the experimental data (R2\u202f>\u202f0.999). Due to the cationic form of propranolol, the adsorption by ionic exchange between charged propranolol and sodium cations onto the interlayer space was the most favorable pathway proposed. Results indicate that adsorption onto Mt proved to be an efficient method for removing propranolol, thus being a viable alternative for the treatment of water contaminated with this drug.", "Refinement of industrial kaolin by microbial removal of iron-bearing impurities ": "The commercial value of kaolin raw materials is greatly affected by the presence and content of iron-bearing impurities, which can have a detrimental effect on the whiteness and refractoriness of manufactured products. Because of the high cost and environmental impact of techniques currently used to remove these impurities, some effort is now targeted toward the development of alternative methods, such as biological processes. This paper reports a series of anaerobic microcosm experiments conducted to evaluate the suitability of iron-respiring bacteria (IRB) of the Shewanella species (S. alga BrY, S. oneidensis MR-1, S. putrefaciens CN32, and S. putrefaciens CIP 8040), in bioleaching iron-bearing impurities from raw kaolin. All tested bacterial strains were able to reduce and leach ferric iron present in the kaolin, thereby substantially improving its color properties. Among the tested bacteria, S. putrefaciens CIP8040 produced the greatest improvements, with increases in ISO brightness and whiteness from 74% to 79% and from 54% to 66%, respectively, in 5days at 30\u00b0C. Neither secondary mineral nor crystal-chemical alteration of the kaolinite was observed by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. Observations of the biotreated kaolins by scanning electron microscopy showed that the original hexagonal shape of the clay particles became less regular. Further research and development should now focus on optimising the rate and extent of the bioleaching process before its application at a larger pilot or industrial scale. In particular, further studies should evaluate the environmental and economical benefits compared to currently used approaches, such as the chemical bleaching with sodium hydrosulfite.", "Removal of Methylene Blue from aqueous solutions by adsorption on Kaolin: Kinetic and equilibrium studies ": "Removal of Methylene Blue (MB) from aqueous solutions is studied using a raw Algerian kaolin sample as a low-cost adsorbent. The effects of pH, contact time, dye concentration and temperature are all taken into consideration. The adsorption kinetics results are adjusted to best fit the pseudo-second order model. The experimental data are analyzed by Langmuir isotherms, revealing that the maximum adsorption capacity of MB on this kaolin sample equals 52.76mg/g at T=25\u00b0C and pH=6.0. The calculated thermodynamic data demonstrates that adsorption is spontaneous and enhanced at higher temperatures. Desorption studies with water indicate that the adsorbent could successfully retain MB, even after four cycles. From these results, it can be considered that the raw Algerian kaolin sample tested herein is effective in the removal of MB from aqueous solutions and moreover may be used as an alternative to high-cost commercial adsorbents.", "Adsorption of a cationic methylene blue dye on an Algerian palygorskite ": "The capacity of an Algerian Tertiary sedimentary palygorskite to remove methylene blue was studied. The raw material was characterized using X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and chemical, granulometric and micotextural analyses. Kinetic experiments were carried out to study the effect of contact time, stirring speed, initial dye concentration and adsorbent mass on the adsorption processes. The palygorskite-rich material mainly consists of this fibrous clay (72%) and calcite (19%) with minor amounts of dolomite (5%), illite (2%) and quartz (2%). After 5\u202fmin contact time at room temperature, the adsorption reaction of a 50\u202fmL solution containing 10\u202fppm of methylene blue on 50\u202fmg of Cal-Pal as adsorbent reached equilibrium, and 97% of cationic dye was fixed. Temperature did not have a significant influence on methylene blue adsorption. The obtained adsorption isotherm indicates high affinity between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. The use of the studied Algerian palygorskite-rich sediment may have great potential for the elimination of textile dyes.", "Recent progress in layered double hydroxides (LDH)-containing hybrids as adsorbents for water remediation ": "With rapidly growing industrial development worldwide, the need for a new class of nanoparticles and techniques for treating wastewater remains a major concern to protect the environment. Layered double hydroxides and particularly LDH-containing hybrids are emerging as potential nano-sized adsorbents for water treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated LDH-containing hybrids as promising multifunctional materials for potential utilization in various applications such as, photo-catalysis, energy storage, nanocomposites and water purification. This article reviews the recent applications of LDH-containing hybrids as adsorbents for water remediation. The maximum adsorption capacities of various toxic heavy metals and dyes on different LDH hybrids were reported as 483mg/g for Pb2+, 95mg/g for Cd2+, 181mg/g for Cu2+, 649mg/g for Cr6+, 180mg/g As5+, 813mg/g for Hg2+, 450 for Ag+, 277mg/g for U6+, 1062mg/g for methyl orange, 185mg/g for methylene blue, and 1250mg/g for Congo red, which is comparatively higher than other commercial adsorbents. This review discusses the adsorption performance of manifold LDH-containing hybrids for treating various pollutants such as heavy metals and dyes. The mechanisms of interaction of LDH-containing hybrids with pollutants and the influence of key adsorption parameters such as pH, contact time, adsorbent dose and temperature have been comprehensively discussed. Moreover, the regeneration potential and reuse of spent LDH-containing hybrids and its toxicity effects have also been reviewed.", "Competitive adsorption of antibiotic tetracycline and ciprofloxacin on montmorillonite ": "As antibiotics continue to be released into soils, it poses a potential threat to human and animal health. The migration-transformation of contaminants in soils is strongly affected by adsorption on clay. Tetracycline (TC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) which are extensively used have been attracted attention recently. Based on adsorption kinetics, isotherm, FT-IR, XRD and molecular simulation, the intercalation and environmental behavior of TC or CIP by montmorillonite (Mt) as single or mixed substance were studied and the adsorption mechanism was also proved. In the mixed system, the relationship between TC and CIP was a competition, but no preferential adsorption. The interaction between antibiotics in interlayer and the adsorption energies were simulated and calculated by molecular simulation to reveal the experimental results.", "Performance of magnetite/layered double hydroxide composite for dye removal via adsorption, Fenton and photo-Fenton processes ": "In order to investigate the effect of the addition of magnetite in layered double hydroxide (LDH) from a structural and catalytic point of view, the synthesis of LDH containing cobalt and chromium (CoCr-LDH) was performed with or without Fe3O4. These materials were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N2 adsorption Isotherms, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and evaluated as adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts in Fenton-like and photo-Fenton-like reactions. The results showed that the magnetite was prepared and incorporated to the LDH with success, forming a composite providing magnetic properties and promoting alteration in the morphology, quantity and size of the LDH pores. The evaluation of the adsorption and oxidation processes utilizing the Fe3O4/LDH composite showed to be more efficient than for pure LDH. This better performance can be explained by higher surface area and larger pores for Fe3O4/LDH which allow a more effective contact with the dye solution and more proximity of large molecules like those of Reactive Black with the sites where the OH\u2022 radicals are formed.", "Sepiolite/TiO2 and metal ion modified sepiolite/TiO2 nanocomposites: synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic activity in abatement of NOx gases ": "Un-exchanged and Zn or Cu ion exchanged samples of a newly discovered sepiolite clay from Greece were combined with nanophase anatase titania for the synthesis of sepiolite based nanocomposites and tested for oxidation of NOx gases. The Zn or Cu ion exchanged clay was modified by replacing the exchangeable cations with Zn or Cu ions. Three separate single phase sepiolite samples were prepared, i.e., the sepiolite (S), the one modified with Zn (Zn-S) and the one modified with Cu (Cu-S). Additionally, three nanocomposites were synthesized combining the above three sepiolite samples with TiO2 in weight ratios of 30:70 and named S-TiO2, Zn-S-TiO2 and Cu-S-TiO2, respectively by depositing TiO2 (anatase) on the sepiolite surfaces using titanium isopropoxide as a precursor under hydrothermal treatment at 180\u202f\u00b0C. The phase composition, particle morphology and physical properties of the sepiolite samples and the nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, ATR-FTIR, TEM, DRS-UV\u2013Vis and N2-sorption/desorption analyses. The photocatalytic activity of all the clay mineral-titania nanocomposites was examined in the decomposition NOx gases. Sepiolite and especially Zn modified sepiolite based nanocomposites showed better photocatalytic activity for the oxidation of NOx gases compared to that of reference photocatalyst titania P25 under UV-light irradiation.", "Adsorbents based on montmorillonite for contaminant removal from water: A review ": "Clay minerals and their modified derivatives have composed a large family of adsorbents which can be used for the adsorption of most of the chemical contaminants from aqueous solution. Among this family of adsorbents, those based on montmorillonite (Mt), a typical 2:1 type clay mineral, have been most extensively studied. This article intends to give a general overview of the microstructure, adsorptive characteristics, and environmental applications of the Mt based adsorbents. A comprehensive survey of the numerous literatures shows that Mt based adsorbents have rather complicated structural and adsorptive characteristics. They may have porous or nonporous structure and contain various functional groups; their interlayer structure may be evidently affected by the incorporation of water molecules in aqueous medium. With the complicated structural characteristics, these adsorbents can be used for a wide variety of contaminants, including hydrophobic organic contaminants, cationic/anionic dyes, heavy metal cations, oxyanions, radioactive nuclides, etc. Accordingly, a wide variety of mechanisms are involved for the uptake of these contaminants, such as surface adsorption, partition, ion exchange, surface precipitation, and structural incorporation. Finally, the approaches for proper disposal/reutilization of the spent adsorbents after contaminant adsorption will be briefly discussed. This review on one hand can help the readers in choosing proper and developing novel clay mineral based adsorbents for target contaminants, and on the other hand can give a proper example to systematically show the various mechanisms for the uptake of contaminants on adsorbents.", "Clays and oxide minerals as catalysts and nanocatalysts in Fenton-like reactions \u2014 A review ": "Advanced oxidation processes (AOP), involving the generation of highly oxidizing radical species, have attracted much attention because of their potential in eliminating recalcitrant organic pollutants from different environmental matrices. Among the most investigated AOP is the Fenton reaction in which hydroxyl radicals (HO) are generated through the catalytic reaction of Fe(II)/Fe(III) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The use of clays and iron-oxide minerals as catalysts of Fenton-like reactions is a promising alternative for the decontamination of soils, groundwaters, sediments, and industrial effluents. The low cost, abundance, and environmentally friendly nature of clay minerals and iron oxides are an added advantage. Additionally, the introduction of nanoparticles in heterogeneous catalytic processes has led to appreciable improvements in catalytic efficiency. Here we review the application of clays and iron-oxide minerals as supports or active catalysts in Fenton-like reactions, and summarize the latest advances in nanocatalyst development. We also evaluate the potential use of allophane nanoparticles, coated with iron oxides, as catalysts of Fenton-like reactions.", "Hectorite: Synthesis, modification, assembly and applications ": "Hectorite (Na0.3Mg2.7Li0.3Si4O10(OH)2) is a trioctahedral clay mineral with peculiar cation exchange capacity, surface reactivity and adsorption, and easy delamination in water into individual nanolayers, which can then re-assemble in various ways. The aqueous dispersion of hectorite exhibits exclusive rheological and thixotropic properties. The paper reviews recent progress in the synthesis, modification, assembly and applications of hectorite. The present methods for synthesizing hectorite are hydrothermal synthesis, melt synthesis and structure-directed synthesis. Modification of hectorite can be made by ion exchange, intercalation, pillaring and grafting. Layer-by-layer assembly, template assembly and hierarchical assembly have been used to formed a variety of hectorite-containing hybrids and nanocomposites such as films, membranes, capsules and Janus nanoparticles. Hectorite and hectorite-derived materials can be used as adsorbents, catalysts, fluorescent reporters, hydrogels, and biomaterials. Literature survey has indicated that hectorite has been successfully used as rheological and thixotropic materials, and are being developed to be used in battery, fluorescent reporters, drug vehicles and tissue engineering.", "Halloysite based nanocomposites and photocatalysis: A Review ": "Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an efficient, relatively cheap and environmentally friendly technology for decomposing various organic and air pollutants. Halloysite is a natural clay mineral usually in the form of nanotubes that has many applications as well as potential uses including photocatalysis. In this paper the photocatalytic activities of halloysite-based nanocomposites in combination with various photocatalysts that have been synthesized and tested in decomposing organic and air pollutants are reviewed. Many photocatalysts have been synthesized and among them TiO2 in the form of anatase, or rutile, or a mixture of both is the most common photocatalyst due to its effectiveness and low cost. Researches by many investigators are summarized and discussed. The possibilities and limitations of halloysite-based nanocomposites for future applications are also discussed and new fields of research are proposed. It is suggested that Halloysite-based nanocomposites are more promising in positively charged organic substrates like tetracycline and Rhodamine B where the organic pollutant is attracted by halloysite's negatively charged external surfaces close to the photocatalysts, than neutral like paracetamol or negatively charged which that attraction does not occur.", "Phosphate capture by ultrathin MgAl layered double hydroxide nanoparticles ": "Capture of phosphorus from runoff and wastewater is of high priority in order to reclaim phosphorus for food security and to prevent water pollution. Here we report an environmentally friendly method to synthesize ultrathin MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles for phosphorus adsorption. Fast co-precipitation of magnesium and aluminum at 25\u201380\u202f\u00b0C in the presence of urea resulted in the desired LDH with variable admixtures of amorphous aluminum hydroxide (16\u201338%) quantified from solid state 27Al MAS NMR. Freshly synthesized particles appeared as exfoliated single layers that upon drying stacked to form particles with thickness of 3 to 5\u202fnm (four to six LDH layers) and lateral sizes of ~30\u202fnm, as seen by XRD, SEM, TEM, and AFM. Phosphate adsorption on LDH nanoparticles synthesized at room temperature (LDHns-U25) was very fast and reaction reached equilibrium within 15\u202fmin at pH\u202f8.5. The freeze-dried LDHns-U25 nanoparticles exhibited phosphate sorption capacity of 98\u202f\u00b1\u202f15\u202fmg P\u00b7g\u22121, which is 55% higher than for conventional LDH. Phosphate was bound to LDH electrostatically and via inner-sphere surface complexation as evidenced from a combination of 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy, surface potential measurements, IR spectroscopy, and ionic strength effects on phosphate sorption. This study demonstrates that urea-facilitated synthesis of LDH nanoparticles provides high capacity phosphate sorbents with potentials for phosphate recovery from waste waters.", "Effects of properties of minerals adsorbents for the adsorption and desorption of volatile organic compounds (VOC) ": "In this study, adsorption and desorption performance of three mineral adsorbents (diatomite, clinoptilolite, and palygorskite) was investigated for abatement of six VOC with distinct physical and chemical properties and functional groups. Among the three mineral adsorbents, palygorskite exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for all the tested VOC as indicated by the adsorption breakthrough curves. Characterization of the adsorbents showed that palygorskite had the highest specific surface area and pore volume. The distinct adsorption capacities of minerals for VOC can be attributed to the difference of VOC's boiling point and polarity. Increasing the adsorption temperature and relative humidity decreased adsorption capacity of the minerals for VOC. Non-polar VOC showed more sensitivity to changes in temperature and relative humidity compared to polar VOC. Desorption performance of the mineral adsorbents was studied in 5-cycle adsorption/desorption experiments. The results indicated that the desorption purge gas has no significant impact on desorption efficiency. However, increasing desorption temperature clearly decreased the cumulative heel on the adsorbent. Moreover, non-polar VOC desorbed better from the mineral surface than polar VOC.", "Rectorite-supported nano-Fe3O4 composite materials as catalyst for P-chlorophenol degradation: Preparation, characterization, and mechanism ": "Clay minerals, as abundant natural resources, are among the most suitable supporting materials for nano metal. In this manuscript, new Fe3O4 nanoparticle/rectorite (Fe3O4/rectorite) catalysts are developed via in-situ precipitation oxidation reaction. Various physicochemical characterizations of Fe3O4/rectorite show that Fe3O4 nanoparticles (nano-Fe3O4) with an average particle diameter of approximately 10\u201320\u202fnm are effectively loaded on the surface of acid leached rectorite (Al-rectorite) and have low coaggregation and improved dispersion. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Fe3O4/rectorite on degradation of P-chlorophenol by heterogeneous Fenton method is studied. Results of degradation experiments show that Fe3O4/rectorite has higher degradation efficiency of P-chlorophenol than bare nano-Fe3O4. Regeneration studies also show that Fe3O4/rectorite maintains 100% of its maximum P-chlorophenol degradation capacity after seven consecutive cycles. Fe3O4/rectorite can be easily separated by magnetic separation, and thus has good stability and reusability. The degradation mechanism of Fe3O4/rectorite is adsorption coupled with a Fenton-like reaction, which accounts for P-chlorophenol degradation of up to 625\u202fmg/g. This work demonstrates a new composite material for the effective remediation of refractory organic compounds from wastewater.", "MgAl-LDH/Biochar composites for methylene blue removal by adsorption ": "In this work, LDH-biochar composites were synthesized in different molar ratios of Mg:Al (2:1, 3:1 and 4:1) using co-precipitation method. The composites were applied to remove an organic dye from aqueous solutions by adsorption. The composites and the pure bovine bone biochars were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG), dispersive energy spectroscopy (DES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The methylene blue dye adsorption experiments were conducted in a finite bath. The results indicate that pH\u202f12 is more suitable for dye adsorption process, with a removal >95% for all composites. The adsorption kinetic was best described by the pseudo-second order model, reaching the equilibrium in approximately 20\u202fmin. The Redlich-Peterson model fit the adsorption equilibrium isotherms satisfactorily. It was obtained a maximum adsorption capacity of 406.47\u202fmg\u00b7g\u22121 at 40\u202f\u00b0C. Negative values of \u0394G indicate the spontaneity of the adsorption process. The positive value of \u0394H (30.72\u202fkJ\u00b7mol\u22121) indicates the physical nature of the adsorption and the positive value of \u0394S (0.1863\u202fkJ\u00b7mol\u22121) indicates that there was a change in the structure of the adsorbent and increased randomness during the fixing of the dye.", "Open source all-iron battery for renewable energy storage ": "The price of renewable energy is dropping rapidly. Energy storage will be needed to take full advantage of abundant but intermittent energy sources. Even with economies of scale, the price is prohibitively high for a lithium-ion battery pack capable of storing tens of kilowatts of energy for many consumers. A more abundant and less expensive material is necessary. All-iron chemistry presents a transformative opportunity for stationary energy storage: it is simple, cheap, abundant, and safe. All-iron batteries can store energy by reducing iron (II) to metallic iron at the anode and oxidizing iron (II) to iron (III) at the cathode. The total cell is highly stable, efficient, non-toxic, and safe. The total cost of materials is $0.1 per watt-hour of capacity at wholesale prices. This battery may be a useful component of open source hardware projects that require a safe and ecologically friendly battery. This is also one of the few battery chemistries that can be built safely in a DIY setting.", "RepRapable Recyclebot: Open source 3-D printable extruder for converting plastic to 3-D printing filament ": "In order to assist researchers explore the full potential of distributed recycling of post-consumer polymer waste, this article describes a recyclebot, which is a waste plastic extruder capable of making commercial quality 3-D printing filament. The device design takes advantage of both the open source hardware methodology and the paradigm developed by the open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer community. Specifically, this paper describes the design, fabrication and operation of a RepRapable Recyclebot, which refers to the Recyclebot\u2019s ability to provide the filament needed to largely replicate the parts for the Recyclebot on any type of RepRap 3-D printer. The device costs less than $700 in mate rials and can be fabricated in about 24\u202fh. Filament is produced at 0.4\u202fkg/h using 0.24\u202fkWh/kg with a diameter \u00b14.6%. Thus, filament can be manufactured from commercial pellets for <22% of commercial filament costs. In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5\u202fcents/kg, which is <1000X commercial filament costs. The system can fabricate filament from polymers with extrusion temperatures <250\u202f\u00b0C and is thus capable of manufacturing custom filament over a wide range of thermopolymers and composites for material science studies of new materials and recyclability studies, as well as research on novel applications of fused filament based 3-D printing.", "Smart Citizen Kit and Station: An open environmental monitoring system for citizen participation and scientific experimentation ": "In the past years, multiple research projects have explored the potential of low-cost environmental sensors for urban air pollution monitoring. However, each project has taken its own independent and in many cases, fully or partially closed approach. We present the Smart Citizen System, a flexible, easy-to-use and fully open-source environmental monitoring solution for particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, noise levels, and many other indicators. The use of low-cost sensors in recent years has been generally approached in two different ways citizen science and educational activities, where the primary purpose is to engage citizens in the measurement process and raise awareness of environmental concerns; and a more sophisticated scientific approach, where the main aim is to study the potentiality of the low-cost sensing technologies. The Smart Citizen System balances modularity with integration to fulfil both needs by providing an extendable solution, with different ranges of sensors based on the same core components. With that aim, two solutions have been developed: the Smart Citizen Kit, intended for citizen science and awareness activities; and the Smart Citizen Station, designed to serve as a more complex and accurate set of air pollution sensors. The design is based on the principle of reproducibility, also integrating non-hardware components such as a dedicated storage platform and a sensor analysis framework. The core system bases its sensing capabilities in widely reviewed low-cost sensors and aims to provide a robust framework for environmental monitoring activities. By making everything open, from the hardware to the software platform or the sensor post-processing algorithms, we hope others might find it useful as a development platform allowing them to focus on their project particular needs instead of reinventing everything from the ground-up.", "Large volume syringe pump extruder for desktop 3D printers ": "Syringe pump extruders are required for a wide range of 3D printing applications, including bioprinting, embedded printing, and food printing. However, the mass of the syringe becomes a major challenge for most printing platforms, requiring compromises in speed, resolution and/or volume. To address these issues, we have designed a syringe pump large volume extruder (LVE) that is compatible with low-cost, open source 3D printers, and herein demonstrate its performance on a PrintrBot Simple Metal. Key aspects of the LVE include: (1) it is open source and compatible with open source hardware and software, making it inexpensive and widely accessible to the 3D printing community, (2) it utilizes a standard 60\u202fmL syringe as its ink reservoir, effectively increasing print volume of the average bioprinter, (3) it is capable of retraction and high speed movements, and (4) it can print fluids using nozzle diameters as small as 100\u202f\u03bcm, enabling the printing of complex shapes/objects when used in conjunction with the freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) 3D printing method. Printing performance of the LVE is demonstrated by utilizing alginate as a model biomaterial ink to fabricate parametric CAD models and standard calibration objects.", "A USB-controlled potentiostat/galvanostat for thin-film battery characterization ": "This article describes the design of a low-cost USB-controlled potentiostat/galvanostat which can measure or apply potentials in the range of \u00b18V, and measure or apply currents ranging from nanoamps to max. \u00b125mA. Precision is excellent thanks to the on-board 20-bit D/A-convertor and 22-bit A/D-convertors. The dual control modes and its wide potential range make it especially suitable for battery characterization. As an example use case, measurements are presented on a lithium-ion test cell using thin-film anatase TiO2 as the working electrode. A cross-platform Python program may be used to run electrochemical experiments within an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

It has potential applications in the development of animal free models for drug toxicity screenings or for personalized medicine approaches. Here we report the conversion of the worldwide used open source 3D printer (RepRap, Prusa i3) to a functional and affordable bioprinter by substituting the common plastic-extruder with the Nydus One Syringe Extruder (NOSE). The NOSE modification enables mechanical hydrogel extrusion as well as a tunable deposition precision and volume by featuring a modular syringe-holder concept. A cost effective and simple hardware design including a custom software (termed \u2018composer\u2019) was developed to prove that this technique can be made accessible for a broader public. Furthermore, the printing procedure was optimized for the peer-reviewed FRESH-method by Hinton et al. which allows to print geometrical complex cell-laden constructs. We provide a detailed protocol on the creation of the FRESH-gel to ensure the reproducibility of this state of the art method. As a proof of concept HEK293 cells as well as mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) were utilized for cell-laden printing. Depending on the cellular source the survival rates range from 60% up to 95%. Automatized quantitative viability analysis was performed using the open source image analysis tool Icy, in particular the \u201cspot detector\u201d plugin. A detailed protocol allows the recreation of the assay.

To capture it, scientists commonly use ruggedized, but expensive acoustic monitoring equipment. In this paper we fully describe the hardware build of a low-cost, small, full-spectrum alternative, called AudioMoth. The credit-card sized device consists of a printed circuit board, micro-controller and a micro-electro-mechanical systems microphone. This simple to construct device facilitates: (1) deployments in remote locations, with a small size and a simple mechanism that allows it to be retrofitted into numerous low-cost ruggedized enclosures; (2) long-term monitoring, with low-power operation; (3) modular expansion, with easy to access general purpose input and output pins; and (4) acoustic detection, with onboard processing power.", "A low-cost Arduino-based datalogger with cellular modem and FTP communication for irrigation water use monitoring to enable access to CropManage ": "The Resource Conservation District of Santa Cruz County implemented a project to improve irrigation management through providing field assistance to growers. A web-based decision support tool called CropManage (https://v3.cropmanage.ucanr.edu) developed by the University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE) of Monterey County aids growers with irrigation scheduling. However, CropManage requires a flowmeter and a monitoring station to track water use in the field. In this article, we describe a device that was conceived as a low-cost alternative to Campbell Scientific flowmeter-monitoring stations that include data logger, modem, enclosure, battery, solar panel and charge regulator and cost above $2000. The device was designed for low-cost, ease of construction and with the capability of emulating the Campbell Scientific equipment functions and outputs. The devices were enabled with FTP communication to a central FTP server and were built with an Arduino MEGA, an Adafruit Datalogging Shield and an Adafruit FONA cellular modem. A voltage divider was added to monitor the external 12\u202fV battery voltage and a DC/DC converter was used to convert 12\u202fV to 5\u202fV. Each field station, including the device, battery, enclosure and solar panel has a total cost below $300, while the FTP server costs less than $100. The device was tested for two years in filed conditions and gave output equivalent to the Campbell Scientific equipment. The device is a low-cost technology that enables growers to gain access to CropManage cheaply and reliably.", "Open-source wideband (DC to MHz range) isolated current sensor ": "A low-cost open-source wideband current sensor, measuring currents in a frequency range from DC to 5\u202fMHz, is proposed. The sensor provides galvanic isolation, low insertion impedance, and can be used together with an oscilloscope as replacement for an expensive current probe, or as circuit integrated sensor, to measure currents with peak values up to 20\u202fA. The hardware of the sensor consists of standard parts soldered on a printed circuit board; no special custom parts and/or manufacturing steps are needed to build. Applications are general measurement and laboratory use, e.g. measuring current waveforms in lab experiments. But the sensor can also be integrated in control circuits requiring measurements of time varying currents, e.g. for high speed current mode control in power electronics.", "Peta-pico-Voltron: An open-source high voltage power supply ": "We present the design (hardware\u202f+\u202fsoftware) of \u201cPeta-pico-Voltron\u201d, a low-current high voltage power supply for electrostatic actuators. Developed primarily for dielectric elastomer actuators, it offers a low-cost solution to generate user controllable voltages up to 5\u202fkV, either continuous, or as square waves with a frequency range between 1\u202fmHz and 1\u202fkHz. The high voltage power supply was developed as an answer to the lack of commercial devices that combine a low cost (<450 USD), portability, and the ability to generate square signals with a high slew rate (>15\u202fV/\u00b5s for a 1\u202fpF load). The PCB is designed to be easy to assemble, with a minimum of panel-mounted elements: the unit is controlled from a computer with a user-friendly interface. A Python library of functions is provided, which enables seamless integration of the power supply with other instruments. Alternatively, simple commands can be sent via a serial connection, which makes it possible to control the power supply with any programming language.

In addition, the system can be fabricated using only open source software and hardware. The design revolves around the Digital Universal Energy Logger (DUEL) Node, which is responsible for reading and properly scaling the voltage and current of a particular load, and then serializing it via an on-board ATTiny85 chip. The configuration of the DUEL node allows for custom sensitivity ranges, and can handle up to 50 A and 300\u202fV. Up to 127 DUEL nodes communicate via Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) on a bus, which can be monitored and logged through an Arduino UNO, or other compatible microcontroller. Using accessible equipment, the DUEL node can be calibrated to a desirable accuracy and error. The DUEL nodes are also completely customizable, making them fit for any input range, where all commercially-available products are fixed range.

First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90% of the costs.", "The Stalker: An open source force meter for rapid stalk strength phenotyping ": "Plant breeding programs use easily measured traits to determine plant selection for the next cycle of testing. Often ratings (1\u201310) are used for generalized biomechanical properties such as lodging, the act of a plant falling over due to environmental conditions.

The microfluidics control system requires only a power source and a computer or mobile device for its operation. A touchscreen interface communicates with the microcontroller over USB or Bluetooth and allows users to control the system with ease either manually or autonomously, allowing experiments to run with no user intervention.

These regulators can also be used as stand-alone devices in any other application.", "An open-source, programmable pneumatic setup for operation and automated control of single- and multi-layer microfluidic devices ": "Microfluidic technologies have been used across diverse disciplines (e.g. high-throughput biological measurement, fluid physics, laboratory fluid manipulation) but widespread adoption has been limited in part due to the lack of openly disseminated resources that enable non-specialist labs to make and operate their own devices. Here, we report the open-source build of a pneumatic setup capable of operating both single and multilayer (Quake-style) microfluidic devices with programmable scripting automation. This setup can operate both simple and complex devices with 48 device valve control inputs and 18 sample inputs, with modular design for easy expansion, at a fraction of the cost of similar commercial solutions.

In this context, the educational buildings sector presents a very interesting and important case for the monitoring and management of buildings, since it addresses both energy and educational issues. In this work, we present and discuss the hardware IoT infrastructure substrate that provides real-time monitoring in multiple school buildings. We believe that such a system needs to follow an open design approach: rely on hardware-agnostic components that communicate over well-defined open interfaces. We present in detail the design of our hardware components, while also providing insights to the overall system design and a first set of results on their operation. The presented hardware components are utilized as the core hardware devices for GAIA, an EU research project aimed at the educational community.

SCA is responsible for over 300,000 deaths per year both in Europe and in USA, and immediate clinical assistance through defibrillation is fundamental for recovery. In this context, an open-source approach can easily lead in improvements to the distribution and efficiency of AEDs. The proposed Open-Source AED (OAED) is composed of two separate electric boards: a high voltage board (HV-B), which contains the circuitry required to perform defibrillation and a control board (C-B), which detects SCA in the patient and controls the HV-B. Computer simulations and preliminary tests show that the OAED can release a 200J biphasic defibrillation in about 12s and detects SCA with sensitivity higher than 90% and specificity of about 99%. The OAED was also conceived as a template and teaching tool in the framework of UBORA, a platform for design and sharing medical devices compliant to international standards.", "Osmar, the open-source microsyringe autosampler ": "Microsyringe manipulation is a common approach for the automated sampling of liquids or gases.

Here, we present osmar, an open-source autosampler built by combining parts of two low-cost G-code machines. Movement precision was excellent (error <1% in repeated injections, equivalent to the error reported by the microsyringe manufacturer), and system reliability was comparable to that of commercial models. Also, users do not need extensive knowledge in electronics or advanced computing to make osmar work as an autosampler, because it can easily be integrated with analytical instruments using AutoIt, a scripting language for the Windows Operating System. Therefore, osmar is a viable, low-cost, and technically-accessible alternative for automated sampling with microsyringes, and can be also adapted and expanded for more general liquid handling tasks.", "Programmable and low-cost ultraviolet room disinfection device ": "Here is presented a room disinfection device based in Ultraviolet-C radiation.

Additionally, ocean current observations near icebergs and marine-terminating glaciers are necessary to estimate their melt rates. Rocky coastlines, icebergs and glaciers, however, present a significant safety risk to manned vessels. We developed an affordable and portable autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) that can safely obtain bathymetry and ocean current measurements in dangerous environments. The Arctic Research Centre Autonomous Boat (ARCAB) is a student-built ASV that can be transported on a euro-pallet and operated from a small boat and from shore. ARCAB has a minimum battery life of 2\u202fh and accommodates a SonTek M9 RiverSurveyor system for bathymetry and ocean current measurements.

Existing commercial USVs are expensive and not fully based on open-source hardware, making it difficult to purchase them and to modify their designs and programming to suit various environments. In contrast, the USV platform proposed in this paper is completely open-source, from hardware to software; most parts of the platform can be 3D-printed, and it can be easily modified and upgraded in terms of both design and programming. The platform is equipped with off-the-shelf water sensors for acquiring data like as pH, turbidity, and temperature to measure water quality in real water resources (such as ponds, reservoirs, and lakes). Furthermore, we provide an Android application through which users can easily control the USV via Bluetooth and display the sensor and GPS data the platform generates. We validated the performance of the platform in terms of usability, mobility, and stability through field experiments in various locations, including both the USA and Peru. Moreover, we present a potential application and approach in which this platform can navigate autonomously by utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Bluetooth protocols.", "An efficient and cost effective FPGA based implementation of the Viola-Jones face detection algorithm ": "We present an field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) based implementation of the popular Viola-Jones face detection algorithm, which is an essential building block in many applications such as video surveillance and tracking.

It is designed to maximise field strength while increasing the pole gap to 5\u202fmm, providing a sample volume large enough for wide applicability. The production of this equipment aims to provide a homogeneous, high field (\u223c2.5\u202fT) magnetic sample environment with a volume large enough to accommodate solution crystallisation experiments in sample chambers such as NMR tubes and cuvettes whilst simultaneously allowing direct observation of the sample from a wide angle. Although the resulting rig is not lightweight at 26.5\u202fkg it is eminently more portable than an equivalent electromagnet system (of the order of 625\u202fkg), and provides a max field strength of 2.468\u202fT with relatively low stray field.", "Implementation of a flexible, open-source platform for ion mobility spectrometry ": "When operated as a stand-alone device, an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) routinely offers low limits of detection (pptv-range) for gas-phase analytes even for measurement times less than a second. Mass analyzers further enhance the analytical power of IMS separations, however, high performance drift-cell IMS instruments are often highly customized, relatively large, and require extensive expertise to operate. In this work we present an optimized, low cost IMS system that leverages an easy-to-assemble ion gating structure that enables IMS spectra with resolving powers exceeding 90 for a drift cell only 10\u202fcm in length. The IMS presented in this work consists of stacked rings divided by spacers all fabricated from printed circuit boards (PCB). The rings are connected via a slotted PCB-board containing a surface mounted voltage divider that connects directly to the ring electrodes allowing a fast and easy assembly. This highly modular design enables e.g. the realization of variable drift tube lengths or single and dual gate setups. Instead of the commonly used Bradbury Nielsen gates, the IMS is equipped with a 3-grid ion gate allowing the generation of short (<50\u202f\u03bcs) ion packets increasing the resolving power of the instrument.", "The impact of future sea-level rise on the global tides ": "Tides are a key component in coastal extreme water levels. Possible changes in the tides caused by mean sea-level rise (SLR) are therefore of importance in the analysis of coastal flooding, as well as many other applications. We investigate the effect of future SLR on the tides globally using a fully global forward tidal model: OTISmpi. Statistical comparisons of the modelled and observed tidal solutions demonstrate the skill of the refined model setup with no reliance on data assimilation. We simulate the response of the four primary tidal constituents to various SLR scenarios. Particular attention is paid to future changes at the largest 136 coastal cities, where changes in water level would have the greatest impact.\n                  Spatially uniform SLR scenarios ranging from 0.5 to 10m with fixed coastlines show that the tidal amplitudes in shelf seas globally respond strongly to SLR with spatially coherent areas of increase and decrease. Changes in the M2 and S2 constituents occur globally in most shelf seas, whereas changes in K1 and O1 are confined to Asian shelves. With higher SLR tidal changes are often not proportional to the SLR imposed and larger portions of mean high water (MHW) changes are above proportional. Changes in MHW exceed \u00b110% of the SLR at ~10% of coastal cities. SLR scenarios allowing for coastal recession tend increasingly to result in a reduction in tidal range. The fact that the fixed and recession shoreline scenarios result mainly in changes of opposing sign is explained by the effect of the perturbations on the natural period of oscillation of the basin. Our results suggest that coastal management strategies could influence the sign of the tidal amplitude change. The effect of a spatially varying SLR, in this case fingerprints of the initial elastic response to ice mass loss, modestly alters the tidal response with the largest differences at high latitudes.", "Swash-zone morphodynamics ": "Hydrodynamic forcing with respect to sediment transport and morphologic change, paying particular attention to relevant swash asymmetries, is reviewed. The hydrodynamics are categorized into their individual effects: high- and low-frequency motions, bores and turbulence, in/exfiltration, shear stresses and friction coefficients. Individual effects are then related to their potential for driving or influencing sediment transport and morphological change. Additional concepts such as settling/scour lag and sediment advection that have largely been ignored are also discussed. A simple framework is presented for the morphological response of the beachface under swash zone hydrodynamic processes. The framework acknowledges that the beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the surf zone and that the two zones are strongly linked through feedback processes. The swash zone itself is also a morphodynamic system and morphological response occurs as a result of disequilibrium between the beachface gradient and asymmetries in the swash hydrodynamics. Any beachface morphological development in response to such equilibrium will have direct and indirect effects on swash hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes. It is concluded that the two issues requiring most urgent research attention with regards to swash zone sediment transport processes are the roles of sediment advection and longshore swash motion.", "The impact of channel deepening and dredging on estuarine sediment concentration ": "Many estuaries worldwide are becoming more urbanised with heavier traffic in the waterways, requiring continuous channel deepening and larger ports, and increasing suspended sediment concentration (SSC). An example of a heavily impacted estuary where SSC levels are rising is the Ems Estuary, located between the Netherlands and Germany. In order to provide larger and larger ships access to three ports and a shipyard, the tidal channels in the Ems Estuary have been substantially deepened by dredging over the past decades. This has led to tidal amplification and hyper concentrated sediment conditions in the upstream tidal river. In the middle and outer reaches of the Ems Estuary, the tidal amplification is limited, and mechanisms responsible for increasing SSC are poorly understood. Most likely, channel and port deepening lead to larger SSC levels because of resulting enhanced siltation rates and therefore an increase in maintenance dredging. Additionally, channel deepening may increase up-estuary suspended sediment transport due to enhanced salinity-induced estuarine circulation.\n                  The effect of channel deepening and port construction on SSC levels is investigated using a numerical model of suspended sediment transport forced by tides, waves and salinity. The model satisfactorily reproduces observed water levels, velocity, sediment concentration and port deposition in the estuary, and therefore is subsequently applied to test the impact of channel deepening, historical dredging strategy and port construction on SSCs in the Estuary. These model scenarios suggest that: (1) channel deepening appears to be a main factor for enhancing the transport of sediments up-estuary, due to increased salinity-driven estuarine circulation; (2) sediment extraction strategies from the ports have a large impact on estuarine SSC; and (3) maintenance dredging and disposal influences the spatial distribution of SSC but has a limited effect on average SSC levels.", "Analysis of tidal currents in the North Sea from shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler data ": "North Sea tidal currents are determined by applying harmonic analysis to ship-borne acoustic Doppler current profiler data recorded from 1999 to 2016, covering large areas of the northern North Sea. Direct current measurement data sets of this magnitude are rare in the otherwise well investigated North Sea, and thus it is a valuable asset in studying and expanding our understanding of its tidal currents and circulation in general. The harmonic analysis is applied to a least squares fit of the current observations at a set of knot points. Results from the harmonic analysis compare favorably to tidal parameters estimated from observations from moored instruments. The analysis shows that the tides are characterized by strong semi-diurnal component, with amplitudes of the principal Lunar constituent ranging from 1.6\u202fcm/s in the Skagerrak to 67\u202fcm/s in the Fair Isle Channel. Diurnal tides are found to be approximately one fifth the strength of the predominant semi-diurnal constituent. Output from a regional barotropic tide model compares well to tidal current determined from the harmonic analysis of the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data.", "Surface and bottom temperature and salinity climatology along the continental shelf off the Canadian and U.S. East Coasts ": "A new hydrographic climatology has been created for the continental shelf region, extending from the Labrador shelf to the Mid-Atlantic Bight. The 0.2-degree climatology combines all available observations of surface and bottom temperature and salinity collected between 1950 and 2010 along with the location, depth and date of these measurements. While climatological studies of surface and bottom temperature and salinity have been presented previously for various regions along the Canadian and U.S. shelves, studies also suggest that all these regions are part of one coherent system. This study focuses on the coherent structure of the mean seasonal cycle of surface and bottom temperature and salinity and its variation along the shelf and upper slope. The seasonal cycle of surface temperature is mainly driven by the surface heat flux and exhibits strong dependency on latitude (r\u2248\u22120.9). The amplitude of the seasonal cycle of bottom temperature is rather dependent on the depth, while the spatial distribution of bottom temperature is correlated with latitude. The seasonal cycle of surface salinity is influenced by several components, such as sea-ice on the northern shelves and river discharge in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The bottom salinity exhibits no clear seasonal cycle, but its spatial distribution is highly correlated with bathymetry, thus Slope Water and its intrusion on the shelf can be identified by its relatively high salinity compared to shallow, fresher shelf water. Two different regimes can be identified, especially on the shelf, separated by the Laurentian Channel: advection influences the phasing of the seasonal cycle of surface salinity and bottom temperature to the north,\u00a0while in the southern region, river runoff and air-sea heat flux forcing are dominant, especially over the shallower bathymetry.", "Sea-level rise impacts on the tides of the European Shelf ": "Sea-level rise (SLR) can modify not only total water levels, but also tidal dynamics. Several studies have investigated the effects of SLR on the tides of the western European continental shelf (mainly the M2 component). We further investigate this issue using a modelling-based approach, considering uniform SLR scenarios from \u22120.25m to +10m above present-day sea level. Assuming that coastal defenses are constructed along present-day shorelines, the patterns of change in high tide levels (annual maximum water level) are spatially similar, regardless of the magnitude of sea-level rise (i.e., the sign of the change remains the same, regardless of the SLR scenario) over most of the area (70%). Notable increases in high tide levels occur especially in the northern Irish Sea, the southern part of the North Sea and the German Bight, and decreases occur mainly in the western English Channel. These changes are generally proportional to SLR, as long as SLR remains smaller than 2m. Depending on the location, they can account for +/\u221215% of regional SLR. High tide levels and the M2 component exhibit slightly different patterns. Analysis of the 12 largest tidal components highlights the need to take into account at least the M2, S2, N2, M4, MS4 and MN4 components when investigating the effects of SLR on tides. Changes in high tide levels are much less proportional to SLR when flooding is allowed, in particular in the German Bight. However, some areas (e.g., the English Channel) are not very sensitive to this option, meaning that the effects of SLR would be predictable in these areas, even if future coastal defense strategies are ignored. Physically, SLR-induced tidal changes result from the competition between reductions in bed friction damping, changes in resonance properties and increased reflection at the coast, i.e., local and non-local processes. A preliminary estimate of tidal changes by 2100 under a plausible non-uniform SLR scenario (using the RCP4.5 scenario) is provided. Though the changes display similar patterns, the high water levels appear to be sensitive to the non-uniformity of SLR.", "Erosion of the coastal Mekong delta: Assessing natural against man induced processes ": "The Lower Mekong Delta Coastal Zone (LMDCZ) is emblematic of the coastal erosion problem facing many tropical deltas. Over the last 3500 years, large river sediment fluxes expanded the delta seaward, and waves and currents formed the Ca Mau Peninsula to the southwest. Since the middle of the 20th century, the LMDCZ is affected by various human activities that include reduction of river fluxes due to damming and sand mining, land subsidence due to groundwater extraction, and reduction of protective coastal mangroves in favor of agriculture and aquaculture. Coastal erosion is observed along many sections of the delta, with a rate of up to 50\u202fm per year in some areas. However, the role of human activities remains difficult to assess because of its complexity. The present modeling study is designed to sort out the contribution of natural hydrodynamic redistribution of sediments from man-induced erosion. The modeling system used is based on CROCO, forced by global reanalyses at the boundaries and at the surface, including wave statistics (required by the sediment transport model). Tides and realistic river forcing are also included. Calibration and validation relies on a combination of in situ and remotely-sensed observations, and laboratory experiments. Once validated, coastal dynamics are investigated by performing sensitivity experiments for both the hydro- and sediment dynamics. The results suggest that while wind is the main factor driving the coastal currents, the sediment dynamics is essentially the result of re-suspension due to wave-induced bed shear stress. The suspended sediments are then redistributed by coastal currents that are not limited to the nearshore zone. Strong seasonality of the process is observed with the northeast winter monsoon being the season of strongest re-suspension and sediment redistribution. The annual sediment budget is characterized by important local disequilibrium, with alongshore patterns that are in agreement with the observed shoreline evolution. The effect of a decrease in river sediment supply is difficult to evaluate because the estuarine zone is still in accretion, apart from the particular case of Go Cong shores. Far from the estuarine zone, subsidence is an additional strong candidate to explain erosion in areas that should naturally be accreting. Synthesizing these results, the study proposes a first attempt at a \u201ctaxonomy and geography\u201d of processes along the coastal Mekong delta that can explain the recent observations of shoreline changes and help design protection measures.", "Extreme westward surface drift in the North Sea: Public reports of stranded drifters and Lagrangian tracking ": "Observations using two kinds of drifters were carried out in the southern North Sea aiming to study the propagation pathways of marine litter. One drifter, which was driven by the upper layer currents, was equipped with Global Positioning System. Further 1600 wooden drifters, mostly driven by wind and Stokes drift, were released offshore in German waters. The detailed reports of stranded wooden drifters from members of the public, the majority of which are likely to be non-scientists, provided a valuable contribution to the drifter experiment demonstrating the usefulness of citizen science. In 2018, an extreme wind event reversed the circulation of North Sea for more than a month which resulted in a large number of wooden drifters being washed ashore on the British coast. Lagrangian numerical experiments, calibrated using data from the drifter observations, helped explain the anomalous transport and the reversal of the circulation at the sea surface and in deeper layers. The plausibility of similar events during past decades has also been estimated using data from atmospheric analyses. Events as strong as the one observed in 2018 occurred only four times in the last 40 years.", "Palaeoshorelines on the Australian continental shelf: Morphology, sea-level relationship and applications to environmental management and archaeology ": "Palaeoshorelines that lie submerged on stable continental shelves are relict coastal depositional and erosional structures formed during periods of lower sea level. An analysis of the well-dated Late Quaternary (0\u2013128 ka) sea-level record indicates that the most persistent (modal) lower sea levels were at 30 \u2013 40m below present, which occurred between 97 and 116 ka and at approximately 85 ka and 10 ka. A secondary modal position was at 70\u201390m that occurred mostly during a period of fluctuating sea level between 30 and 60 ka, as well as at around 87 ka (70 \u2013 80m only) and 12\u221215 ka. For the tectonically stable Australian continental shelf, we show that a range of shorelines formed at each of these sea level modal positions and their morphology and degree of preservation depends on composition (carbonate vs siliciclastic) and oceanographic setting (wave, tide and wind energy). These ancient coasts record a range of oceanographic and geological regimes that existed during relatively long periods of lower sea level and provide a guide to the general depth zones in which similar features likely occur on other shelves globally. Australian palaeoshorelines represent distinctive benthic habitats that strongly influence the distribution of biodiversity across the shelf. Accurate mapping of these features provides a robust geospatial framework for investigations of marine species distributions and environmental change monitoring. These data also enable the better targeting of relict coastal areas that potentially include sand resources and sites of human occupation during periods of lower sea level.", "Application of UAV techniques to expand beach research possibilities: A case study of coarse clastic beach cusps ": ":\n               \n                  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have widely been documented as accessible, low cost, high-resolution coastal monitoring platforms. To date, however, UAVs have primarily been employed in coastal research as an alternative to traditional survey methods, such as beach profiling, despite their capabilities far exceeding such uses. In this contribution, we present UAV surveys as a technique to expand upon previous research possibilities through a case study on coarse clastic beach cusps. Currently no consensus exists regarding the primary mechanism responsible for development of these rhythmic features, not least due to the need for more comprehensive and timely observational data. Previous research on beach cusps is limited to repeat monitoring of a small number of cusps, or monitoring large cusp sets at relatively coarse spatial resolution. Here, repeat UAV surveys along a 600\u202fm stretch of composite beach in New Zealand are employed to produce the most comprehensive characterisation of cusp parameters (spacing, amplitude, depth) available to date. Furthermore, the use of UAVs in this mixed sediment environment has made it possible to link cuspate morphology, such as horns and bays, to surface sediment texture. This critical advance provides new opportunities for coupling textural and topographic data in future analyses and modelling approaches. We argue that the enhanced, but still nascent, opportunity to observe morphodynamics using UAV survey methods can be critical to advancing our understanding of complex coastal zone features and changes.", "Sediment transport and morphodynamical modeling on the estuaries and coastal zone of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta ": "The estuaries and coastal zones of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta located at the end of the Mekong Basin are susceptible to a large variety of natural threats and human interventions such as upstream dam construction, climate change and sea level rise. In this study, we investigated sediment dynamics and morphodynamic changes in the Mekong estuaries and coastal zone, using a well-calibrated Delft3D-4 model for a 10-years period simulation. For the first time, the impacts of different drivers were distinguished to guide future adaptation strategies and policies. Our investigations pointed out that the influences of upstream sediment reduction and large-scale sand extraction would cause substantial modifications in the subaqueous delta region. Besides human-induced impacts, modeling results also showed that the sediment volume and spatial distribution changed through the simulated period according to monsoonal variation. The influence of each driver, however, not only varied in space but also time. In the flood season, the Mekong and Bassac Rivers provided a large amount of sediment (more than 90%) that was deposited on the delta front due to coastal processes. The sediment quantity transported along the coastline changed with the monsoon and was in a dominantly south-west direction due to the northeast monsoon, especially in November, December and January. As a natural process, in the estuarine region, erosion and deposition occurred alternately, but the south-west coast region (belonging to the Ca Mau peninsula) was dominated by erosion. This is because of the formation of sand bars in front of the Bassac estuaries, which influences the capacity of sediment transportation to the south-west. Consequently, navigation capacity will reduce significantly in the estuaries and coastline erosion in the Ca Mau peninsula leads to substantial loss of houses and assets of local people. Urgent actions such as stopping sand mining or modifying dam designs are needed to sustain the delta coastline.", "Ocean acidification along the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the USA ": "As part of an effort to monitor changes in inorganic carbon chemistry of the coastal ocean, near-synoptic cruises are being conducted in the Northern Gulf of Mexico and along the East Coast of the United States. Here we describe observations obtained on a cruise in the summer of 2012 and compare them with results from a cruise following a similar track in 2007. The focus is on describing spatial patterns of aragonite saturation state (\u03a9\n                     Ar). This parameter is an indicator of ecosystem health, in particular for calcifying organisms. The results show large-scale regional trends from different source waters at the northeastern and southwestern edges of the domain, along with the modulating effects of remineralization/respiration and riverine inputs. The broader patterns and changes over five years along the coast can be well described by the impacts of large-scale circulation, notably changes in source water contributions. Changes in the well-buffered Loop Current and Gulf Stream with high \u03a9\n                     Ar impact the waters in the southern part of the study area. The less buffered southward coastal currents with low \u03a9\n                     Ar originating from the Labrador Sea and Gulf of St. Lawrence impact the \u03a9\n                     Ar patterns in the Northern regions. The expected 2% average decrease in \u03a9\n                     Ar in the surface mixed layer due to increasing atmospheric CO2 levels over the 5-year period is largely overshadowed by local and regional variability from changes in hydrography and mixed layer dynamics.", "Non-cohesive and cohesive sediment transport due to tidal currents and sea waves: A case study ": "A model is proposed to determine the sediment transport rate generated by the combined action of sea waves and tidal currents, the latter being modelled as a sequence of steady currents because of the large values of the Keulegan-Carpenter number of the tidal flows, which allow to neglect inertial effects in their modelling. The hydrodynamic module solves Reynolds-averaged momentum equations by introducing a two-equation turbulence model, which considers also the flow in the region closest to the sea bottom and enforces the no-slip condition and the vanishing of the turbulent kinetic energy at the bottom without the need to assume the existence of a logarithmic velocity profile and to fix the normal derivative of the turbulent kinetic energy close to the sea bed. Hence, the evaluation of the velocity profile in the near-bed region turns out to be accurate. The sediment transport module determines the sediment concentration and sediment transport for a mixture of non-cohesive and cohesive sediments. To validate the model, its predictions are compared with laboratory measurements and field data collected over rippled beds at two different tidal estuaries. Then, results are obtained for values of the parameters chosen to mimic a site close to Punta Umbr\u00eda (Huelva, Spain) and considering different hydrodynamic conditions and different sediment mixtures. The influence of the waves on the suspended sediment concentration is lower for the cohesive fraction than for the non-cohesive fraction. For all the sediment mixtures, it turns out that the cohesive fraction is well mixed over the whole water depth, meanwhile the concentration of the non-cohesive fraction has significant values only near the bottom, thus showing that an accurate description of turbulence dynamics in the buffer layer and viscous sublayer (if it exists) is important to quantify the sediment transport rate.", "German Bight estuaries: An inter-comparison on the basis of numerical modeling ": "The Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM), which is an unstructured-grid model, was coupled with a 3D sediment model and established for the German Bight and its estuaries. The horizontal resolution of the model ranges from ~10\u202fm in the estuaries to ~400\u202fm in most of the open sea. Validation against tidal gauge data, fixed station data, and FerryBox data demonstrated that the model adequately simulated tidal dynamics in the entire area as well as the salinity fronts and estuarine turbidity maxima in the Ems, Weser and Elbe estuaries. Comparisons of model output with that of experiments with constant density allowed to estimate the role of density control, which appeared to be strongest in the landward reaches of salinity front. The increase of tidal range caused by density effects was most prominent in the Weser and Elbe estuaries, and relatively small in the Ems, where the runoff was also small. The magnitude of the density effect on the sea level oscillations was comparable to that of the M4 tide amplitude, demonstrating its importance in shaping the tidal asymmetry in the estuaries. Density effects not only reduced the dissipation of tidal energy; density stratification suppressed also the resuspension of sediment and contributed to a displacement of the position of the estuarine turbidity maximum upstream compared to the case of an homogeneous estuary. In the case of hyper-turbid Ems Estuary, density effects on stratification caused by high sediment concentrations resulted in a suppression of turbulence and further increase of concentration of suspended matter at the bottom. Although the three estuaries, which are only ~100\u202fkm apart, were driven by similar tidal and atmospheric forcings, they exhibited different extensions of both fronts and vertical stratification, mainly due to different river runoff conditions. At intra-tidal time scales, the dependencies between sea surface height and sea surface salinity varied considerably from estuary to estuary, and the largest flood asymmetry appeared in the Elbe Estuary. Wind acted as the dominant factor driving the longer-term estuarine variability; the correlation between zonal wind magnitude and sea surface height appeared to be very strong. The simulated suspended particulate matter dynamics and position of the estuarine turbidity maxima (ETM) were in agreement with observations. Secondary ETM appeared at different locations depending on the grain size, providing an illustration of sediment sorting.", "Distinctive characteristics of upwelling along the Peninsular Malaysia's east coast during 2009/10 and 2015/16\u202fEl Ni\u00f1os ": "We investigate the southwest monsoon average structure and interannual variability of upwelling along the Peninsular Malaysia's east coast (PMEC) based on satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), reanalysis wind data and cruise observations. The upwelling area prompted by southwest monsoon winds is represented by a patch of cooler water along the coast. This cooler water is also an outcome of the cooler water flooded from the Karimata Strait, nonetheless, localised upwelling conditions demonstrating their substantial impact to further cool down this already cooled water. Results from empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis revealed that variation in SST was dominated by the first EOF mode, which accountable of 80.99% of total variance and its loading map demonstrated a persistence of SST front, represented the signature of upwelling. The time series of the first EOF mode was highly correlated with the alongshore wind stress anomalies, indicating the Ekman transport driven nature of upwelling interannual variability. We demonstrate that a delayed El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect as an important factor for the interannual variations of upwelling along the PMEC. Our analysis focusing on the two recent strongest El Ni\u00f1os, 2009/10 and 2015/16 revealed that the intense northwest Pacific anticyclone anomaly (NWPAA) and the occurrence of the northerly wind anomalies from the subtropical western Pacific (SWP) in 2010 weakened the upwelling along the PMEC. While in 2016, the occurrence of the \u2018C-shape\u2019 wind anomalies generated by the warming of the southeast tropical Indian Ocean (SETIO) weakened the upwelling along the PMEC.", "Characterizing the vertical distribution of chlorophyll a in the German Bight ": "Coastal and shelf seas display strong variability in the horizontal and vertical distributions of chlorophyll a (CHL). Detailed data are required to identify the processes that drive the observed spatio-temporal dynamics. A high-resolution, vertically resolved transect data set for biogeochemical and physical properties was collected in the inner German Bight (GB) from 2009 to 2011 on a seasonal basis. We used fluorescence as an indicator for phytoplankton biomass via the CHL concentrations. We classified profiles into different types by evaluating the heterogeneity of CHL vertical distribution and identifying vertical location (upper mixed layer, subsurface layer, bottom mixed layer of water column) of high CHL concentration in each profile. We analyzed the spatio-temporal occurrences of the different CHL vertical distribution types in the context of the hydrodynamic environment. More than half (68.7%) of all profiles showed vertically homogeneous CHL distributions. A smaller subset (3.2%) of all profiles showed subsurface CHL maximum layers (SCMLs) in the vicinity of the pycnocline, co-varying with strongly stratified conditions in deeper water. Profiles with highest concentration of CHL in the upper part of the water column (HCU) were observed in 11.5% of all profiles. Profiles with highest concentrations of CHL in the lower part of the water column (HCL) comprised 16.6% of all profiles. HCL profiles were extensively observed during the decay phase of the spring bloom and were associated with resuspension and erosion from pre-existing SCMLs, which could be driven by tide; photosynthetic activity below the pycnocline could also contribute. Under moderate weather conditions, tidal currents were the main driver of resuspension. This study highlighted the occurrence of SCMLs and HCL patterns in vertical CHL profiles in shallow shelf seas, such as the GB.", "Marine megafauna niche coexistence and hotspot areas in a temperate ecosystem ": "In the last few decades, there has been a remarkable development of niche models to help understand the ecological response of species to current rapid environmental changes. In the present study, we applied niche modelling to the megafauna community of shelf waters of the northwestern (NW) and northern Iberian Peninsula in order to analyse the coexistence of different species taking into consideration their niche preferences. The Spanish Institute of Oceanography conducts the PELACUS multidisciplinary survey annually to assess pelagic fish stocks and collect information on the status of other ecosystem components, such as oceanographic conditions, phytoplankton, zooplankton and marine megafauna. Using data collected from these surveys, we developed niche models for 14 marine megafauna taxa (3 cetaceans, 10 seabirds and 1 fish) incorporating multi-trophic ecological descriptors collected simultaneously during the surveys alongside the more commonly used oceanographic variables (e.g. chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature). Megafauna niche models were developed by pooling observations from 2007 to 2013 and were found to be driven by mean fish biomass and its variability, in addition to sea surface temperature. Hierarchical clustering identified four distinct megafauna assemblages, the first comprising wide-ranging species and the other three associated with shelf-slope waters in Galicia, coastal/shelf waters in Galicia, and the eastern Cantabrian Sea, respectively. Community-level hotspot areas were found in shelf and shelf-break sectors of Galicia, along with small diversity spots scattered throughout the Cantabrian coastal area. Our results showed that synoptically collected survey-based ecological descriptors, especially acoustic-based preyscapes, were among the most important variables explaining megafauna niche preference. These findings highlight the advantage of using integrated ecosystem surveys to collect simultaneous information on a suite of ecosystem components for spatial assessments.", "Factors regulating the phytoplankton and tintinnid microzooplankton communities in the East China Sea ": "To investigate the effect of bottom-up factors (resource, hydrography, and environmental factors) on the phytoplankton and tintinnid microzooplankton communities, the research voyage was conducted in September 2017\u202fat the East China Sea. An aggregate of 273 taxa of phytoplankton and 65 taxa of tintinnids were identified. Diatoms and dinoflagellates were the major groups of phytoplankton observed while the chain-forming diatoms were the most dominant group present in the study area. The coastal water and Kuroshio water influenced the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients as well as phytoplankton abundance. The concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients increased vertically with the water depth while the phytoplankton and tintinnid abundance diminished. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Pearson correlation analysis were conducted to analyze the relationship between the planktonic community and the ecological components. The RDA analysis between phytoplankton abundance and nutrients concentration showed that phytoplankton abundance increased with the increase in concentration of ammonium while a negative relationship was observed between phytoplankton abundance and nitrate, phosphate, and silicate. There was a significant positive correlation between the tintinnid microzooplankton and nanophytoplankton abundance as well as in their species richness which indicated that the tintinnid community depended upon nanophytoplankton for their feeding habit and growth rather than nutrients.", "Shelf sea subsurface chlorophyll maximum thin layers have a distinct phytoplankton community structure ": "The Western English Channel is a seasonally stratified temperate coastal sea where a subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) is typically detectable within the seasonal thermocline. The SCM often develops as a thin layer (<\u00a05\u202fm) that may contain elevated concentrations of phytoplankton (subsurface chlorophyll maximum thin layer; SCMTL). During summer 2013 a study was conducted offshore of Falmouth, UK to assess spatial and short-term temporal variability in SCM thickness in relation to water column structure and physical conditions and to evaluate any associated changes in phytoplankton community structure. SCMTLs were observed in 18 of 52 vertical profiles, typically characterised by higher chlorophyll concentrations than broader SCMs. SCMTLs were generally associated with a \u2018stepped\u2019 thermocline, likely representing the presence of one or more shallow mixed layers forming above/within the seasonal thermocline, and related to increased stratification compared to broader SCMs. Pseudo-nitzschia was almost exclusively the dominant diatom taxon in SCMs, yet statistically distinct differences in community structure existed between SCMTLs and broader SCMs. Within the phytoplankton, the distinction was largely due to a greater biomass of Proboscia alata and other rhizosolenid diatoms, and the dinoflagellate Ceratium lineatum in SCMTLs, and a smaller population of the diatom Chaetoceros spp. There was also a distinction amongst heterotrophic dinoflagellates, with enhanced biomass of Gyrodinium spp. in SCMTLs and a reduction in Diplopsalis lenticula. We propose that this observed difference resulted from promotion of phytoplankton better adapted to environmental conditions more specific to SCMTLs compared to broader SCMs. With more intense and prolonged stratification projected for the NW European shelf, there may be increased prevalence of SCMTLs and the associated larger-sized specialised taxa, with implications for increased carbon export. This study adds to a growing body of evidence of the importance of SCMTLs in coastal and shelf seas, and highlights the requirement for improved understanding of physical forcing and the ecology and physiology of key taxa, particularly as predicted changes in stratification could alter the role of SCM phytoplankton in a future influenced by climate change.", "Modeling salt intrusion in the San Francisco Estuary prior to anthropogenic influence ": "Anthropogenic changes have dramatically transformed the upper San Francisco Estuary over the past two centuries. Key changes influencing the region\u2019s hydrology and hydrodynamics include land use changes, levee construction and channel modifications, upstream reservoir construction, and out-of-basin water exports. In order to examine how these changes have altered the physical characteristics of the estuary, 3-D hydrodynamic models were constructed to study the system in its \u201cpre-development\u201d condition, prior to significant modern anthropogenic influence, and in its contemporary condition. The pre-development system model was calibrated by varying marsh plain elevations in order to match sparse observations of tidal characteristics; the contemporary system model was calibrated to observed flow, stage, and salinity data. A recent three-year period covering a wide range of flow conditions was used to compare and contrast the hydrodynamic behavior of the two systems. While the contemporary model simulation assumed historical observed boundary conditions, the pre-development model simulation assumed conditions thought to exist prior to the alterations of the past two centuries. The relationship between estuary outflow and the longitudinal distance from the estuary mouth to the 2psu bottom salinity isohaline (X2) was analyzed. Salt intrusion in the pre-development system was found to be slightly more sensitive to outflow and responded faster to changes in outflow than in the contemporary system. Changes in estuary outflows were responsible for more of the salt intrusion differences between the two systems than were changes in estuary geometry and bathymetry. An analysis of the physical mechanisms contributing to salt intrusion found tidal trapping and other unsteady processes to be more important in the pre-development estuary than in the contemporary one. In both systems, steady processes such as estuarine circulation were strongest during neap tides and unsteady salt intrusion processes were strongest during spring tides, resulting in limited spring-neap variability in salt intrusion.", "Properties of Red Sea coastal currents ": "Properties of coastal flows of the central Red Sea are examined using 2 years of velocity data acquired off the coast of Saudi Arabia near 22\u00b0N. The tidal flow is found to be very weak. The strongest tidal constituent, the M2 tide, has a magnitude of order 4cms\u22121. Energetic near-inertial and diurnal period motions are observed. These are surface-intensified currents, reaching magnitudes of >10cms\u22121. Although the diurnal currents appear to be principally wind-driven, their relationship with the surface wind stress record is complex. Less than 50% of the diurnal current variance is related to the diurnal wind stress through linear correlation. Correlation analysis reveals a classical upwelling/downwelling response to the alongshore wind stress. However, less than 30% of the overall sub-inertial variance can be accounted for by this response. The action of basin-scale eddies, impinging on the coastal zone, is implicated as a primary mechanism for driving coastal flows.", "A water column study of methane around gas flares located at the West Spitsbergen continental margin ": "In the Arctic Seas, the West Spitsbergen continental margin represents a prominent methane seep area. In this area, free gas formation and gas ebullition as a consequence of hydrate dissociation due to global warming are currently under debate. Recent studies revealed shallow gas accumulation and ebullition of methane into the water column at more than 250 sites in an area of 665km2. We conducted a detailed study of a subregion of this area, which covers an active gas ebullition area of 175km2 characterized by 10 gas flares reaching from the seafloor at~245m up to 50m water depth to identify the fate of the released gas due to dissolution of methane from gas bubbles and subsequent mixing, transport and microbial oxidation.\n                  The oceanographic data indicated a salinity-controlled pycnocline situated ~20m above the seafloor. A high resolution sampling program at the pycnocline at the active gas ebullition flare area revealed that the methane concentration gradient is strongly controlled by the pycnocline. While high methane concentrations of up to 524nmolL\u22121 were measured below the pycnocline, low methane concentrations of less than 20nmolL\u22121 were observed in the water column above.

A gas bubble dissolution model indicates that ~80% of the methane released from gas bubbles into the ambient water takes place below the pycnocline. This dissolved methane will be laterally transported with the current northwards and most likely microbially oxidized in between 50 and 100 days, since microbial CH4 oxidation rates of 0.78nmold\u22121 were measured. Above the pycnocline, methane concentrations decrease to local background concentration of ~10nmolL\u22121.\n                  Our results suggest that the methane dissolved from gas bubbles is efficiently trapped below the pycnocline and thus limits the methane concentration in surface water and the air\u2013sea exchange during summer stratification. During winter the lateral stratification breaks down and fractions of the bottom water enriched in methane may be vertically mixed and thus be potentially an additional source for atmospheric methane.", "Benthic controls of resuspension in UK shelf seas: Implications for resuspension frequency ": "In situ measurements and ship-based resuspension experiments using annular flumes are used to determine sediment stability and critical erosion thresholds for four sites with significantly different sediment characteristics, located in the Celtic Sea at water depths of 100\u202fm. Seasonal and spatial variability of sediment characteristics and erodability is examined, and found to be the result of changes in percentage of organic carbon in the surface sediments (R2 = 0.82) and bulk density (R2 = 0.73) respectively when individual characteristic bed parameters are considered. Principal component analysis and linear regression analysis are used to determine a predictive model for erosion threshold in the Celtic Sea (R2 = 0.99), based on grain size, sorting, kurtosis, bulk density, porosity, percentage fines, organic carbon content and chlorophyll a concentration. Physical sediment characteristics were found to be more significant controls of bed stability than biological factors. Local hydrodynamic conditions are used to determine the likelihood and frequency of resuspension given these critical erosion thresholds. Resuspension is driven by tidal currents, and is common year-round, leading to a constant re-working of bed sediments in particular at the muddier sites. This is confirmed by in situ measurements of suspended sediment concentration.", "Spatiotemporal variation in summer net community production in the Amundsen Sea Polynya: A self-organizing map analysis approach ": "We estimated weekly summer net community production (NCP) in the Amundsen Sea Polynya for 2010\u20132011 and 2011\u20132012 using the self-organizing map analysis technique, which is a type of artificial neural network useful for discovering underlying structure in datasets. The net community production estimates derived with four variables (sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, chlorophyll-a, and photosynthetically available radiation) robustly reproduced the observed net community production in the Amundsen Sea Polynya. The mean net community productions were estimated as 0.42\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09 and 0.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.07 gC m\u22122\u202fd\u22121 in 2010\u20132011 and 2011\u20132012, respectively. The maximum weekly net community production of 1.29 gC m\u22122\u202fd\u22121 in 2011\u20132012 was greater than in 2010\u20132011 by 0.32 gC m\u22122\u202fd\u22121. The net community production in 2010\u20132011, derived using the self-organizing map, showed weekly variation similar to the trend of satellite-derived production of the Eppley-Vertically Generalized Production Model. However, in 2011\u20132012, it exhibited different temporal variation both in peak timing and in magnitude of the bloom. This implies the existence of complex processes not readily resolved by the four variables used in our self-organizing map analysis. Therefore, further observations during different blooming stages are required to improve self-organizing map-derived net community production estimates.", "The influence of aggregation on cohesive sediment erosion and settling ": "The influence of aggregation on cohesive sediment erosion and settling was investigated in a semi-enclosed coastal lagoon with a bed consisting of sediment in the clay to sand size range. Cores of bed material and seawater were used for ex situ laboratory experiments investigating the erosion of the sediment bed and the settling of aggregates. The results showed that the cohesive bed was primarily eroded as aggregates and aggregation was the major contributor to the formation of microflocs in the system. The aggregates eroded from the bed were relatively stable up to a bed shear stress level of at least 0.5\u202fN\u202fm\u22122. The eroded aggregates displayed high settling velocities relative to the aggregate sizes in comparison to previous water column studies from similar environments. Since high settling velocities limit the advective transport, the erosion of aggregates potentially plays a significant role for the cohesive sediment dynamics of a coastal system. The impact of aggregation on cohesive sediment erosion and settling is important to understand in order to improve general understanding of coastal environments and to strengthen the reproduction of cohesive sediment dynamics in numerical models.", "The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and their energy, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions implications: An overview ": "This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400\u20131200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2\u00b0C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).", "Climate, conflict and forced migration ": "Despite the lack of robust empirical evidence, a growing number of media reports attempt to link climate change to the ongoing violent conflicts in Syria and other parts of the world, as well as to the migration crisis in Europe. Exploiting bilateral data on asylum seeking applications for 157 countries over the period 2006\u20132015, we assess the determinants of refugee flows using a gravity model which accounts for endogenous selection in order to examine the causal link between climate, conflict and forced migration. Our results indicate that climatic conditions, by affecting drought severity and the likelihood of armed conflict, played a significant role as an explanatory factor for asylum seeking in the period 2011\u20132015. The effect of climate on conflict occurrence is particularly relevant for countries in Western Asia in the period 2010\u20132012 during when many countries were undergoing political transformation. This finding suggests that the impact of climate on conflict and asylum seeking flows is limited to specific time period and contexts.", "Food choices, health and environment: Effects of cutting Europe's meat and dairy intake ": "Western diets are characterised by a high intake of meat, dairy products and eggs, causing an intake of saturated fat and red meat in quantities that exceed dietary recommendations. The associated livestock production requires large areas of land and lead to high nitrogen and greenhouse gas emission levels. Although several studies have examined the potential impact of dietary changes on greenhouse gas emissions and land use, those on health, the agricultural system and other environmental aspects (such as nitrogen emissions) have only been studied to a limited extent. By using biophysical models and methods, we examined the large-scale consequences in the European Union of replacing 25\u201350% of animal-derived foods with plant-based foods on a dietary energy basis, assuming corresponding changes in production. We tested the effects of these alternative diets and found that halving the consumption of meat, dairy products and eggs in the European Union would achieve a 40% reduction in nitrogen emissions, 25\u201340% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and 23% per capita less use of cropland for food production. In addition, the dietary changes would also lower health risks. The European Union would become a net exporter of cereals, while the use of soymeal would be reduced by 75%. The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of the food system would increase from the current 18% to between 41% and 47%, depending on choices made regarding land use. As agriculture is the major source of nitrogen pollution, this is expected to result in a significant improvement in both air and water quality in the EU. The resulting 40% reduction in the intake of saturated fat would lead to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. These diet-led changes in food production patterns would have a large economic impact on livestock farmers and associated supply-chain actors, such as the feed industry and meat-processing sector.", "The black box of power in polycentric environmental governance ": "Failure to address unsustainable global change is often attributed to failures in conventional environmental governance. Polycentric environmental governance\u2014the popular alternative\u2014involves many centres of authority interacting coherently for a common governance goal. Yet, longitudinal analysis reveals many polycentric systems are struggling to cope with the growing impacts, pace, and scope of social and environmental change. Analytic shortcomings are also beginning to appear, particularly in the treatment of power. Here we draw together diverse social science perspectives and research into a variety of cases to show how different types of power shape rule setting, issue construction, and policy implementation in polycentric governance. We delineate an important and emerging research agenda for polycentric environmental governance, integrating diverse types of power into analytical and practical models.", "Trees, forests and water: Cool insights for a hot world ": "Forest-driven water and energy cycles are poorly integrated into regional, national, continental and global decision-making on climate change adaptation, mitigation, land use and water management. This constrains humanity\u2019s ability to protect our planet\u2019s climate and life-sustaining functions. The substantial body of research we review reveals that forest, water and energy interactions provide the foundations for carbon storage, for cooling terrestrial surfaces and for distributing water resources. Forests and trees must be recognized as prime regulators within the water, energy and carbon cycles. If these functions are ignored, planners will be unable to assess, adapt to or mitigate the impacts of changing land cover and climate. Our call to action targets a reversal of paradigms, from a carbon-centric model to one that treats the hydrologic and climate-cooling effects of trees and forests as the first order of priority. For reasons of sustainability, carbon storage must remain a secondary, though valuable, by-product. The effects of tree cover on climate at local, regional and continental scales offer benefits that demand wider recognition. The forest- and tree-centered research insights we review and analyze provide a knowledge-base for improving plans, policies and actions. Our understanding of how trees and forests influence water, energy and carbon cycles has important implications, both for the structure of planning, management and governance institutions, as well as for how trees and forests might be used to improve sustainability, adaptation and mitigation efforts.", "Sustainable development: Our Common Future revisited ": "No clear definition of sustainable development exists to guide politicians in solving challenges at the global or regional levels. Rather, the concept's use has increasingly reflected socially desirable attributes of solutions to local- and project-level problems, but these ignore the global challenges that the concept was meant to address. We return to the original definition of sustainable development used in the Brundtland Report and suggest an assessment method to determine whether countries currently meet the threshold values of four equally important primary dimensions: safeguarding long-term ecological sustainability, satisfying basic needs, and promoting intragenerational and intergenerational equity. We also define indicators and threshold values for each of these dimensions; in addition, we show how 167 countries compare in meeting these threshold values. Currently, no country meets all four thresholds. Even so, we propose that, with the use of technology and behavioural changes, it will be possible to reach the threshold values by 2030.", "Seepage: Climate change denial and its effect on the scientific community ": "Vested interests and political agents have long opposed political or regulatory action in response to climate change by appealing to scientific uncertainty. Here we examine the effect of such contrarian talking points on the scientific community itself. We show that although scientists are trained in dealing with uncertainty, there are several psychological reasons why scientists may nevertheless be susceptible to uncertainty-based argumentation, even when scientists recognize those arguments as false and are actively rebutting them. Specifically, we show that prolonged stereotype threat, pluralistic ignorance, and a form of projection (the third-person effect) may cause scientists to take positions that they would be less likely to take in the absence of outspoken public opposition. We illustrate the consequences of seepage from public debate into the scientific process with a case study involving the interpretation of temperature trends from the last 15 years. We offer ways in which the scientific community can detect and avoid such inadvertent seepage.", "The challenge of valuing ecosystem services that have no material benefits ": "Since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ecosystem service science has made much progress in framing core concepts and approaches, but there is still debate around the notion of cultural services, and a growing consensus that ecosystem use and ecosystem service use should be clearly differentiated. Part of the debate resides in the fact that the most significant sources of conflict around natural resource management arise from the multiple managements (uses) of ecosystems, rather than from the multiple uses of ecosystem services.\n                  If the ecosystem approach or the ecosystem service paradigm are to be implemented at national levels, there is an urgent need to disentangle what are often semantic issues, revise the notion of cultural services, and more broadly, practically define the less tangible ecosystem services on which we depend. This is a critical step to identifying suitable ways to manage trade-offs and promote adaptive management.\n                  Here we briefly review the problems associated with defining and quantifying cultural ecosystem services and suggest there could be merit in discarding this term for the simpler non-material ecosystem services. We also discuss the challenges in valuing the invaluable, and suggest that if we are to keep ecosystem service definition focused on the beneficiary, we need to further classify these challenging services, for example by differentiating services to individuals from services to communities. Also, we suggest that focussing on ecosystem service change rather than simply service delivery, and identifying common boundaries relevant for both people and ecosystems, would help meet some of these challenges.", "Agricultural and forestry trade drives large share of tropical deforestation emissions ": "Deforestation, the second largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, is largely driven by expanding forestry and agriculture. However, despite agricultural expansion being increasingly driven by foreign demand, the links between deforestation and foreign demand for agricultural commodities have only been partially mapped. Here we present a pan-tropical quantification of carbon emissions from deforestation associated with the expansion of agriculture and forest plantations, and trace embodied emissions through global supply chains to consumers. We find that in the period 2010\u20132014, expansion of agriculture and tree plantations into forests across the tropics was associated with net emissions of approximately 2.6 gigatonnes carbon dioxide per year. Cattle and oilseed products account for over half of these emissions. Europe and China are major importers, and for many developed countries, deforestation emissions embodied in imports rival or exceed emissions from domestic agriculture. Depending on the trade model used, 29\u201339% of deforestation-related emissions were driven by international trade. This is substantially higher than the share of fossil carbon emissions embodied in trade, indicating that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land-use change need to consider the role of international demand in driving deforestation. Additionally, we find that deforestation emissions are similar to, or larger than, other emissions in the carbon footprint of key forest-risk commodities. Similarly, deforestation emissions constitute a substantial share (\u02dc15%) of the total carbon footprint of food consumption in EU countries. This highlights the need for consumption-based accounts to include emissions from deforestation, and for the implementation of policy measures that cross these international supply-chains if deforestation emissions are to be effectively reduced.", "An innovative approach to the assessment of hydro-political risk: A spatially explicit, data driven indicator of hydro-political issues ": "Competition over limited water resources is one of the main concerns for the coming decades. Although water issues alone have not been the sole trigger for warfare in the past, tensions over freshwater management and use represent one of the main concerns in political relations between riparian states and may exacerbate existing tensions, increase regional instability and social unrest. Previous studies made great efforts to understand how international water management problems were addressed by actors in a more cooperative or confrontational way. In this study, we analyze what are the pre-conditions favoring the insurgence of water management issues in shared water bodies, rather than focusing on the way water issues are then managed among actors. We do so by proposing an innovative analysis of past episodes of conflict and cooperation over transboundary water resources (jointly defined as \u201chydro-political interactions\u201d). On the one hand, we aim at highlighting the factors that are more relevant in determining water interactions across political boundaries. On the other hand, our objective is to map and monitor the evolution of the likelihood of experiencing hydro-political interactions over space and time, under changing socioeconomic and biophysical scenarios, through a spatially explicit data driven index. Historical cross-border water interactions were used as indicators of the magnitude of corresponding water joint-management issues. These were correlated with information about river basin freshwater availability, climate stress, human pressure on water resources, socioeconomic conditions (including institutional development and power imbalances), and topographic characteristics. This analysis allows for identification of the main factors that determine water interactions, such as water availability, population density, power imbalances, and climatic stressors. The proposed model was used to map at high spatial resolution the probability of experiencing hydro-political interactions worldwide. This baseline outline is then compared to four distinct climate and population density projections aimed to estimate trends for hydro-political interactions under future conditions (2050 and 2100), while considering two greenhouse gases emission scenarios (moderate and extreme climate change). The combination of climate and population growth dynamics is expected to impact negatively on the overall hydro-political risk by increasing the likelihood of water interactions in the transboundary river basins, with an average increase ranging between 74.9% (2050 \u2013 population and moderate climate change) to 95% (2100 - population and extreme climate change). Future demographic and climatic conditions are expected to exert particular pressure on already water stressed basins such as the Nile, the Ganges/Brahmaputra, the Indus, the Tigris/Euphrates, and the Colorado. The results of this work allow us to identify current and future areas where water issues are more likely to arise, and where cooperation over water should be actively pursued to avoid possible tensions especially under changing environmental conditions. From a policy perspective, the index presented in this study can be used to provide a sound quantitative basis to the assessment of the Sustainable Development Goal 6, Target 6.5 \u201cWater resources management\u201d, and in particular to indicator 6.5.2 \u201cTransboundary cooperation\u201d.", "Water on an urban planet: Urbanization and the reach of urban water infrastructure ": "Urban growth is increasing the demand for freshwater resources, yet surprisingly the water sources of the world's large cities have never been globally assessed, hampering efforts to assess the distribution and causes of urban water stress. We conducted the first global survey of the large cities\u2019 water sources, and show that previous global hydrologic models that ignored urban water infrastructure significantly overestimated urban water stress. Large cities obtain 78\u00b13% of their water from surface sources, some of which are far away: cumulatively, large cities moved 504 billion liters a day (184km3\n                     yr\u22121) a distance of 27,000\u00b13800km, and the upstream contributing area of urban water sources is 41% of the global land surface. Despite this infrastructure, one in four cities, containing $4.8\u00b10.7 trillion in economic activity, remain water stressed due to geographical and financial limitations. The strategic management of these cities\u2019 water sources is therefore important for the future of the global economy.", "Reconceptualising adaptation to climate change as part of pathways of change and response ": "The need to adapt to climate change is now widely recognised as evidence of its impacts on social and natural systems grows and greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Yet efforts to adapt to climate change, as reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case studies, have not led to substantial rates of implementation of adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation science. Moreover, implemented actions have been mostly incremental and focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more systemic or transformative actions. We found that the nature and effectiveness of responses was strongly influenced by framing. Recent decision-oriented approaches that aim to overcome this situation are framed within a \u201cpathways\u201d metaphor to emphasise the need for robust decision making within adaptive processes in the face of uncertainty and inter-temporal complexity. However, to date, such \u201cadaptation pathways\u201d approaches have mostly focused on contexts with clearly identified decision-makers and unambiguous goals; as a result, they generally assume prevailing governance regimes are conducive for adaptation and hence constrain responses to proximate causes of vulnerability. In this paper, we explore a broader conceptualisation of \u201cadaptation pathways\u201d that draws on \u2018pathways thinking\u2019 in the sustainable development domain to consider the implications of path dependency, interactions between adaptation plans, vested interests and global change, and situations where values, interests, or institutions constrain societal responses to change. This re-conceptualisation of adaptation pathways aims to inform decision makers about integrating incremental actions on proximate causes with the transformative aspects of societal change. Case studies illustrate what this might entail. The paper ends with a call for further exploration of theory, methods and procedures to operationalise this broader conceptualisation of adaptation.", "Changes in the global value of ecosystem services ": "In 1997, the global value of ecosystem services was estimated to average $33trillion/yr in 1995 $US ($46trillion/yr in 2007 $US). In this paper, we provide an updated estimate based on updated unit ecosystem service values and land use change estimates between 1997 and 2011. We also address some of the critiques of the 1997 paper. Using the same methods as in the 1997 paper but with updated data, the estimate for the total global ecosystem services in 2011 is $125trillion/yr (assuming updated unit values and changes to biome areas) and $145trillion/yr (assuming only unit values changed), both in 2007 $US. From this we estimated the loss of eco-services from 1997 to 2011 due to land use change at $4.3\u201320.2trillion/yr, depending on which unit values are used. Global estimates expressed in monetary accounting units, such as this, are useful to highlight the magnitude of eco-services, but have no specific decision-making context. However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies. We emphasize that valuation of eco-services (in whatever units) is not the same as commodification or privatization. Many eco-services are best considered public goods or common pool resources, so conventional markets are often not the best institutional frameworks to manage them. However, these services must be (and are being) valued, and we need new, common asset institutions to better take these values into account.", "Multi-level governance and power in climate change policy networks ": "This article proposes an innovative theoretical framework that combines institutional and policy network approaches to study multi-level governance. The framework is used to derive a number of propositions on how cross-level power imbalances shape communication and collaboration across multiple levels of governance. The framework is then applied to examine the nature of cross-level interactions in climate change mitigation and adaptation policy processes in the land use sectors of Brazil and Indonesia. The paper identifies major barriers to cross-level communication and collaboration between national and sub-national levels. These are due to power imbalances across governance levels that reflect broader institutional differences between federal and decentralized systems of government. In addition, powerful communities operating predominantly at the national level hamper cross-level interactions. The analysis also reveals that engagement of national level actors is more extensive in the mitigation and that of local actors in the adaptation policy domain, and specialisation in one of the climate change responses at the national level hampers effective climate policy integration in the land use sector.", "Urban land-use change: The role of strategic spatial planning ": "To date land-change science has devoted little attention to spatial policy and planning in urban landscapes despite the widely accepted premise that planning affects urban land change. This is primarily due to lack of relevant data and an underdeveloped theoretical understanding regarding the impact of spatial planning on urban land change. To be able to better analyse the role of spatial planning in urban development we need to distinguish: 1) the intentions expressed in the plans; 2) the means of implementation of the plans through governance processes and 3) the role of external conditions influencing implementation. Based on a synthesis of the current literature on how spatial planning is implemented in land-change models, and drawing from the literature on planning evaluation, we sketch a research agenda to further develop the understanding of these three components and their interconnections as well as their application in quantitative land-change modelling approaches for urban regions.", "Resilience: The emergence of a perspective for social\u2013ecological systems analyses ": "The resilience perspective is increasingly used as an approach for understanding the dynamics of social\u2013ecological systems. This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960\u20131970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social\u2013ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge\u2013system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services.", "Empirical evidence of declining global vulnerability to climate-related hazards ": "Death tolls and economic losses from natural hazards continue to rise in many parts of the world. With the aim to reduce future impacts from natural disasters it is crucial to understand the variability in space and time of the vulnerability of people and economic assets. In this paper we quantified the temporal dynamics of socio-economic vulnerability, expressed as fatalities over exposed population and losses over exposed GDP, to climate-related hazards between 1980 and 2016. Using a global, spatially explicit framework that integrates population and economic dynamics with one of the most complete natural disaster loss databases we quantified mortality and loss rates across income levels and analyzed their relationship with wealth. Results show a clear decreasing trend in both human and economic vulnerability, with global average mortality and economic loss rates that have dropped by 6.5 and nearly 5 times, respectively, from 1980\u20131989 to 2007\u20132016. We further show a clear negative relation between vulnerability and wealth, which is strongest at the lowest income levels. This has led to a convergence in vulnerability between higher and lower income countries. Yet, there is still a considerable climate hazard vulnerability gap between poorer and richer countries.", "The human core of the shared socioeconomic pathways: Population scenarios by age, sex and level of education for all countries to 2100 ": "This paper applies the methods of multi-dimensional mathematical demography to project national populations based on alternative assumptions on future, fertility, mortality, migration and educational transitions that correspond to the five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) storylines. In doing so it goes a significant step beyond past population scenarios in the IPCC context which considered only total population size. By differentiating the human population not only by age and sex\u2014as is conventionally done in demographic projections\u2014but also by different levels of educational attainment the most fundamental aspects of human development and social change are being explicitly addressed through modeling the changing composition of populations by these three important individual characteristics. The scenarios have been defined in a collaborative effort of the international Integrated Assessment Modeling community with the medium scenario following that of a major new effort by the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (IIASA, OEAW, WU) involving over 550 experts from around the world. As a result, in terms of total world population size the trajectories resulting from the five SSPs stay very close to each other until around 2030 and by the middle of the century already a visible differentiation appears with the range between the highest (SSP3) and the lowest (SSP1) trajectories spanning 1.5 billion. The range opens up much more with the SSP3 reaching 12.6 billion in 2100 and SSP1 falling to 6.9 billion which is lower than today's world population.", "Dynamic adaptive policy pathways: A method for crafting robust decisions for a deeply uncertain world ": "A new paradigm for planning under conditions of deep uncertainty has emerged in the literature. According to this paradigm, a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term actions, and establish a framework to guide future actions. A plan that embodies these ideas allows for its dynamic adaptation over time to meet changing circumstances. We propose a method for decisionmaking under uncertain global and regional changes called \u2018Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways\u2019. We base our approach on two complementary approaches for designing adaptive plans: \u2018Adaptive Policymaking\u2019 and \u2018Adaptation Pathways\u2019. Adaptive Policymaking is a theoretical approach describing a planning process with different types of actions (e.g. \u2018mitigating actions\u2019 and \u2018hedging actions\u2019) and signposts to monitor to see if adaptation is needed. In contrast, Adaptation Pathways provides an analytical approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible actions based on alternative external developments over time. We illustrate the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach by producing an adaptive plan for long-term water management of the Rhine Delta in the Netherlands that takes into account the deep uncertainties about the future arising from social, political, technological, economic, and climate changes. The results suggest that it is worthwhile to further test and use the approach.", "Network analysis reveals open forums and echo chambers in social media discussions of climate change ": "Action to tackle the complex and divisive issue of climate change will be strongly influenced by public perception. Online social media and associated social networks are an increasingly important forum for public debate and are known to influence individual attitudes and behaviours \u2013 yet online discussions and social networks related to climate change are not well understood. Here we construct several forms of social network for users communicating about climate change on the popular microblogging platform Twitter. We classify user attitudes to climate change based on message content and find that social networks are characterised by strong attitude-based homophily and segregation into polarised \u201csceptic\u201d and \u201cactivist\u201d groups. Most users interact only with like-minded others, in communities dominated by a single view. However, we also find mixed-attitude communities in which sceptics and activists frequently interact. Messages between like-minded users typically carry positive sentiment, while messages between sceptics and activists carry negative sentiment. We identify a number of general patterns in user behaviours relating to engagement with alternative views. Users who express negative sentiment are themselves the target of negativity. Users in mixed-attitude communities are less likely to hold a strongly polarised view, but more likely to express negative sentiment towards other users with differing views. Overall, social media discussions of climate change often occur within polarising \u201cecho chambers\u201d, but also within \u201copen forums\u201d, mixed-attitude communities that reduce polarisation and stimulate debate. Our results have implications for public engagement with this important global challenge.", "The Expansion of Intensive Beef Farming to the Brazilian Amazon ": "Systems of intensive animal farming, such as the confinement of beef cattle, are widespread in the developed world. Such practices have been under scrutiny since the 1960s for animal welfare and pollution issues. Here, we document the expansion of intensive beef farming to the Brazilian Amazon in order to assess socio-environmental implications. Using a combination of data mining and field surveys, we developed a georeferenced dataset of 201 cattle confinements in the states of Mato Grosso (Cerrado and Amazon biomes), Par\u00e1 and Rond\u00f4nia (Amazon biome), collected in 2017. In Mato Grosso, the country\u2019s agribusiness powerhouse, confinements are well established and account for \u02dc20% of the cattle slaughter. But rapid expansion in Par\u00e1 and Rond\u00f4nia remains largely unnoticed due to the absence of data since 2012. We used the new dataset to map cattle confinements across space and time. For the first time, (1) we document an expansion to the Amazon biome; (2) we also show that confinements are associated with substantially higher productivity rates, though intensified pasture-based systems can reach comparable yields; (3) that confinements have crop production levels 2-3 times higher than comparable properties, both in- and out-of-farm; and (4) that confinements tend to slow down on-property deforestation when compared to fattening ranches in the Amazon biome, although off-property effects could be substantial and need further study. Overall, the implications of intensive beef farming for animal welfare and local waste generation in Brazil require attention as pressure to avoid deforestation continues to stimulate the practice.", "What are the limits to oil palm expansion? ": "Palm oil production has boomed over the last decade, resulting in an expansion of the global oil palm planting area from 10 to 17 Million hectares between 2000 and 2012. Previous studies showed that a significant share of this expansion has come at the expense of tropical forests, notably in Indonesia and Malaysia, the current production centers. Governments of developing and emerging countries in all tropical regions increasingly promote oil palm cultivation as a major contributor to poverty alleviation, as well as food and energy independence. However, being under pressure from several non-governmental environmental organizations and consumers, the main palm oil traders have committed to sourcing sustainable palm oil. Against this backdrop we assess the area of suitable land and what are the limits to future oil palm expansion when several constraints are considered. We find that suitability is mainly determined by climatic conditions resulting in 1.37 billion hectares of suitable land for oil palm cultivation concentrated in twelve tropical countries. However, we estimate that half of the biophysically suitable area is already allocated to other uses, including protected areas which cover 30% of oil palm suitable area. Our results also highlight that the non-conversion of high carbon stock forest (>100t AGB/ha) would be the most constraining factor for future oil palm expansion as it would exclude two-thirds of global oil palm suitable area. Combining eight criteria which might restrict future land availability for oil palm expansion, we find that 234 million hectares or 17% of worldwide suitable area are left. This might seem that the limits for oil palm expansion are far from being reached but one needs to take into account that some of this area might be hardly accessible currently with only 18% of this remaining area being under 2h transportation to the closest city and that growing demand for other agricultural commodities which might also compete for this land has not been yet taken into account.", "Energy, land-use and greenhouse gas emissions trajectories under a green growth paradigm ": "This paper describes the possible developments in global energy use and production, land use, emissions and climate changes following the SSP1 storyline, a development consistent with the green growth (or sustainable development) paradigm (a more inclusive development respecting environmental boundaries). The results are based on the implementation using the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model and are compared with a) other IMAGE implementations of the SSPs (SSP2 and SSP3) and b) the SSP1 implementation of other integrated assessment models. The results show that a combination of resource efficiency, preferences for sustainable production methods and investment in human development could lead to a strong transition towards a more renewable energy supply, less land use and lower anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2100 than in 2010, even in the absence of explicit climate policies. At the same time, climate policy would still be needed to reduce emissions further, in order to reduce the projected increase of global mean temperature from 3\u00b0C (SSP1 reference scenario) to 2 or 1.5\u00b0C (in line with current policy targets). The SSP1 storyline could be a basis for further discussions on how climate policy can be combined with achieving other societal goals.", "The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought ": "Food production requires application of fertilizers containing phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium on agricultural fields in order to sustain crop yields. However modern agriculture is dependent on phosphorus derived from phosphate rock, which is a non-renewable resource and current global reserves may be depleted in 50\u2013100 years. While phosphorus demand is projected to increase, the expected global peak in phosphorus production is predicted to occur around 2030. The exact timing of peak phosphorus production might be disputed, however it is widely acknowledged within the fertilizer industry that the quality of remaining phosphate rock is decreasing and production costs are increasing. Yet future access to phosphorus receives little or no international attention. This paper puts forward the case for including long-term phosphorus scarcity on the priority agenda for global food security. Opportunities for recovering phosphorus and reducing demand are also addressed together with institutional challenges.", "The vulnerabilities of agricultural land and food production to future water scarcity ": "Rapidly increasing populations coupled with increased food demand requires either an expansion of agricultural land or sufficient production gains from current resources. However, in a changing world, reduced water availability might undermine improvements in crop and grass productivity and may disproportionately affect different parts of the world. Using multi-model studies, the potential trends, risks and uncertainties to land use and land availability that may arise from reductions in water availability are examined here. In addition, the impacts of different policy interventions on pressures from emerging risks are examined.\n                  Results indicate that globally, approximately 11% and 10% of current crop- and grass-lands could be vulnerable to reduction in water availability and may lose some productive capacity, with Africa and the Middle East, China, Europe and Asia particularly at risk. While uncertainties remain, reduction in agricultural land area associated with dietary changes (reduction of food waste and decreased meat consumption) offers the greatest buffer against land loss and food insecurity.", "Validation of coffee by-products as novel food ingredients ": "This research aimed to validate coffee husk, parchment and silverskin as new health-promoting food ingredients. Characterization of the novel ingredients was carried out by Raman and infrared spectroscopy and analysis of total phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid, caffeine and dietary fiber. Antioxidant properties of the novel ingredients were tested by ABTS and intracellular ROS formation in HepG2 cells. Pesticides, mycotoxins, acrylamide and acute toxicity experiments following OECD Test Guidelines 425 were performed to assess the food safety of extracts, solid residues and raw materials. Husk and silverskin are proposed as a source of two food ingredients: aqueous extracts enriched in phytochemicals and antioxidant dietary fiber while parchment is proposed as a natural source of antioxidant dietary fiber. No lesions were found in selected isolated vital organs from treated animals. Coffee by-products can be converted into safe food ingredients allowing a whole food waste recovery. Analyses of contaminants are essential for achieving this goal.", "Iron bioavailability from food fortification to precision nutrition. A review ": "Iron deficiency anaemia is a Worldwide Public Health problem and the fortification of food with iron is the most cost-effective prevention strategy. The correct combination of iron form and food vehicle is crucial, as well as the dietary context of consumption. Combinations of iron with an enhancer of its bioavailability and avoidance of interaction with iron inhibitors are recommended. New iron fortificants, innovative complexes, coatings and nanoparticulates, and biofortification are the main research lines. Ultimately, human assays are necessary before industrial production. In this regard, precision nutrition helps to identify the vulnerable groups that, according to genotype, dietary habits, physical activity and, most recently, metagenomic profile, may benefit from a specific iron-fortified food. This review addresses the modifiers of iron bioavailability and the main aspects to take into account in the development of iron-fortified food to prevent iron deficiency.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  \n                     \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           The potential target population that would benefit from iron-fortified foods is that at risk of iron deficiency.

Use of an inline viscometer in milk powder manufacture allows greater process control by monitoring the dynamic viscosity of the process concentrate pumped to the spray drier. In this study, an inline Promass I300 was used to measure the dynamic viscosity of both a Newtonian fluid (10\u201360% w/w sucrose solutions) and a non-Newtonian fluid (10\u201340% w/w skim milk concentrate) at laboratory scale at 25\u202f\u00b0C. Validation of the instrument for measurement of a non-Newtonian fluid was completed at pilot-scale under similar operating conditions. Coefficient of determination (R2\u202f=\u202f0.99) was obtained between inline and offline viscosity measurements for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids investigated. This study demonstrated the potential of an inline Coriolis flowmeter for rapid and accurate measurement of dynamic viscosity during processing of dairy streams.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  Control of milk concentrate viscosity during the manufacture of milk powder is critical to reduce energy consumption, reduce fouling and meet powder functional properties e.g. dispersability, flowability, particle size and powder hydration. The use of inline instruments for continuous monitoring of viscosity offers economic benefits to the producer as it can contribute to reduction in commonly encountered process issues such as fouling, blocking of nozzles and evaporator, which can result in process downtime and in extreme cases, product rework. Inline instruments can thus be employed to improve process control and reduce production waste during the manufacture of dairy powders.", "Reductions of Listeria monocytogenes on cold-smoked and raw salmon fillets by UV-C and pulsed UV light ": "Salmon is the food most frequently reported in the RASFF (Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed) database in conjunction with Listeria monocytogenes and consumption of cold-smoked salmon have led to severe outbreaks of listeriosis infections. UV-C and pulsed UV light were investigated for their ability to reduce L. monocytogenes on salmon. Cold-smoked and raw salmon were spiked with a mix of ten L. monocytogenes strains (104\u202fCFU/sample) and subsequently exposed to UV-C light (0.0075\u20130.6\u202fJ/cm2) or high intensity pulsed UV light (1.3\u201310.8\u202fJ/cm2). Reductions of L. monocytogenes on smoked salmon were 0.7\u20131.3\u202flog, depending on the fluence. Corresponding reductions for raw salmon muscle side and skin side were 0.2\u20130.9\u202flog and 0.4\u20131.1\u202flog, respectively. Generally, reductions using UV-C and pulsed UV light were within the same range, but with some treatments statistically different. L. monocytogenes surviving UV treatments on smoked and raw salmon grew at the same rate as controls during storage at 4\u202f\u00b0C, but reached the levels of the controls 13 and 7\u202fdays later, respectively. No sensory changes were detected in UV-C treated (0.05\u202fJ/cm2) smoked salmon.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  Due to the lack of critical control points in salmon production, it is not possible to ensure products that are consistently free from L. monocytogenes in the absence of mitigation strategies. Taking into account the reported generally low levels of L. monocytogenes on contaminated salmon, UV treatments should be considered important tools for the industry to contribute to lower prevalence and levels of Listeria. The present work on microbial and quality effects of UV-C and pulsed UV light treatments performed under industry relevant conditions on raw and cold-smoked salmon provides important information to the salmon industry for implementation of UV-light as risk reducing mitigation tools. This has key relevance for industry and consumers and will contribute to enhanced food safety, reduction of costly recalls and longer shelf-life.", "Insects as ingredients for bakery goods. A comparison study of H. illucens, A. domestica and T. molitor flours ": "Due to a rising demand for proteins, food industry is considering new alternative protein sources that can be used for human food. The aim of this research was to explore the potential use of insects' flour as protein-rich ingredient for bakery products. Hermetia illucens, Acheta domestica and Tenebrio molitor were ground and used to replace 5% wheat flour in doughs and breads. The protein content of the insect flours ranged from 45% to 57% (d.m.) and fat content from 27% to 36% (d.m.). The inclusion of insects' flour affected the rheological properties (water absorption and stability), of dough during mixing, having less water adsorption. Breadmaking process could be carried out with all the composite flours. Breads containing A. domestica flour showed similar specific volume and texture parameters than wheat bread, but with higher content of proteins and fibers. Globally, results confirmed the usefulness of insects' flour for making breads with improved nutritional value.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  This study evaluated the potential application of three different insects as protein source ingredients for bakery products.

Increasingly, sensory data techniques are moving towards more dynamic aspects of sensory perception, taking account of the various stages of user-product interactions. Recent technological advancements in virtual reality and augmented reality have unlocked the potential for new immersive and interactive systems which could be applied as powerful tools for capturing and deciphering the complexities of human sensory perception. This paper reviews recent advancements in virtual and augmented reality technologies and identifies and explores their potential application within the field of sensory science. The paper also considers the possible benefits for the food industry as well as key challenges posed for widespread adoption. The findings indicate that these technologies have the potential to alter the research landscape in sensory science by facilitating promising innovations in five principal areas: consumption context, biometrics, food structure and texture, sensory marketing and augmenting sensory perception. Although the advent of augmented and virtual reality in sensory science offers new exciting developments, the exploitation of these technologies is in its infancy and future research will understand how they can be fully integrated with food and human responses.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  The need for sensory evaluation within the food industry is becoming increasingly complex as companies continuously compete for consumer product acceptance in today's highly innovative and global food environment. Recent technological developments in virtual and augmented reality offer the food industry new opportunities for generating more reliable insights into consumer sensory perceptions of food and beverages, contributing to the design and development of new products with optimised consumer benefits. These technologies also hold significant potential for improving the predictive validity of newly launched products within the marketplace.", "Potential and challenges of insects as an innovative source for food and feed production ": "Edible insects, a traditional food all over the world, are highly nutritious with high fat, protein and mineral contents depending on the species and thus represent a noteworthy alternative food and feed source and a potential substitute e. g. for fishmeal in feed formulae. Research is required to develop and automatize cost-effective, energy-efficient and microbially safe rearing, harvest and post harvest processing technologies as well as sanitation procedures to ensure food and feed safety and produce safe insect products at a reasonable price on an industrial scale especially in comparison to meat products. In addition, consumer acceptance needs to be established.

Special emphasis will be on the advantages/disadvantages of each technology.", "A systematic analysis on tomato powder quality prepared by four conductive drying technologies ": "Four pilot-scale conductive dryers, namely a vacuum drum dryer (VDD), a drum dryer (DD), an agitated thin film dryer (ATFD) and a refractance window dryer (RWD), were used to dry tomato puree. Drying induced colour differences between the reconstituted puree and the original puree and strongly affected the volatile and non-volatile profiles of the powders. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified four separated groups corresponding to the different drying methods, indicating that the drying methods caused significant variance in compound profiles. Subsequently, pairwise comparison of different dried powders was performed by partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). This resulted in a selection of discriminative volatile and non-volatile markers. RWD and VDD produced powders with high volatile markers that may be related to aroma retention. Conversely, DD dried products contained more non-volatile markers that can be related to taste perception. ATFD processed powders had a lower level of discriminant compounds.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  Tomato products are frequently thermally processed and dehydrated. However, processing negatively affects the sensory quality of tomato products. In this study, four conductive drying processes, i.e. vacuum drum drying (VDD), drum drying (DD), agitated thin film drying (ATFD) and refractance window drying (RWD) were studied for being energy-efficient drying methods, while suitable for mild (e.g. due to the reduced pressure) drying of pastes and slurries, such as tomato puree. The pilot-scale drying experiments and subsequent statistical analyses of results on quality markers contributed to unravel the impact of the different conductive drying technologies on tomato powder quality. This study may be considered a starting point for selection of conductive drying technologies for the efficient production of high quality tomato powders and other vegetable powders.", "Cricket powder (Gryllus assimilis) as a new alternative protein source for gluten-free breads ": "Gluten elimination in bakery goods is a technological challenge since the absence of gluten generates breads with poor capacity to retain gas during leavening, which can be minimised with the use of gluten-free proteins in combination with hydrocolloids and/or enzymes. Due to the increasing world population and scarce land resources to expand current food production, it is necessary to find alternative and sustainable ways of growing food. This study aimed to characterise cricket (Gryllus assimilis) powder as a new protein source for gluten-free breads in comparison with the use of lentil and buckwheat flours. Cricket powder presented high water and oil holding capacities and appropriate microbiological features for human consumption. Results confirm that the enrichment with cricket powder can lead to the production of gluten-free bread with acceptable technological properties and high protein content. As the addition of cricket powder increases lipid contents, for better nutritional and functional results, the use of oil-free formulations is recommended.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  Considering the rising world population and the scarce water and land resources, it is extremely important to find new and sustainable ways to produce food. Edible insects are particularly interesting due to its high protein content and lower environmental impacts compared to traditional livestock. This study evaluated the use of cricket powder as protein source for the production of gluten-free bread in comparison with two other protein sources: buckwheat and lentil flours. Results confirm that the enrichment with cricket powder can lead to the production of gluten free bread with acceptable technological properties and high protein content.", "Microencapsulation of bacteria: A review of different technologies and their impact on the probiotic effects ": "Probiotic based products are associated with many health benefits. However, the main problem is the low survival of these microorganisms in food products and in gastrointestinal tract. Providing probiotics with a physical barrier is an efficient approach to protect microorganisms and to deliver them into the gut. In our opinion, microencapsulation is one of the most efficient methods, and has been under especial consideration and investigation. However, there are still many challenges to overcome with respect to the microencapsulation process. This review focuses mainly on the methodological approach of probiotic encapsulation including materials and results obtained using encapsulated probiotic in food matrices and different pathologies in animal models.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  The inclusion of probiotics into food matrices is one of the most challenging lines of research in food technology. Probiotics in general, and some strains in particular, have a low resistance to different environmental conditions, such as oxygen, light or temperature. Thus, the protection and isolation of the microorganism from the food matrix and the environmental condition are crucial for the development of new probiotic food. In this sense, microencapsulation has gained an increasing interest, since it has been demonstrated that it could protect the bacteria not only during its production process but also during its incorporation into the food matrix, also with protective effects during storage. In conclusion, microencapsulation is of great interest since it could allow a wider application of probiotics in the food market, actually restricted to fresh or powder products.", "Radio-frequency treatment for stabilization of wheat germ: Storage stability and physicochemical properties ": "Wheat germ (WG) is a nutritional valuable by-product of wheat milling. However, presences of high lipase (LA) activity and high content of unsaturated fatty acids induce rapid lipid rancidity in WG during storage. The aim of this study was to inactivate LA activity and improve the lipid stability of WG using radio-frequency (RF) heating treatment. Meanwhile, the color, functional, structure and antioxidant properties of WG samples stabilized by effective RF and conventional steaming treatments were also compared. Results indicated that WG stabilized by RF heating to 100\u202f\u00b0C with holding for 15\u202fmin in hot air or heating to 110\u202f\u00b0C with holding for 5\u202fmin could effectively inactivate LA activity to 18.2% or 22.5% of their original values. Under these conditions, the WG can be maintained with the acceptable oil quality for >90\u202fd at controlled room condition in zip-lock PE bags. The color values and water/oil absorption capacity of WG were improved by RF stabilization treatments, but the protein solubility (PS) and foaming properties were reduced. RF stabilized WG also showed comparable emulsifying properties, total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacity (AC) to those of control. Compared with steam treatments, RF stabilized samples exhibited a brighter color, higher PS, TPC, or AC, better foaming/emulsifying properties, and clearer outline presence with intact starch granules in microstructure. RF treatments could be a promising stabilization method and improve some physiochemical properties of WG, which are important for industrial applications.", "Review of Green Food Processing techniques. Preservation, transformation, and extraction ": "This review presents innovative food processing techniques and their role in promoting sustainable food industry. These techniques (such as microwave, ultrasound, pulse electric field, instant controlled pressure drop, supercritical fluid processing) in the frontiers of food processing, food chemistry, and food microbiology, are not new and were already used for >30years by academia and industry. We will pay special attention to the strategies and the tools available to make preservation, transformation and extraction greener and present them as success stories for research, education and at industrial scale. The design of green and sustainable processes is currently a hot research topic in food industry.

The Spirulina-based microalgal extract is mainly comprised of heat sensitive protein-chromophore complexes, C-phycocyanin and allophycocyanin. Although frequently encountered in food processing, the impact of short time heat treatments has not been studied systematically. Here, phosphate buffered phycocyanin solution was heated in batch and emerging continuous processing systems, both characterized with high surface-to-volume ratios allowing isothermal conditions with residence times down to 5\u202fs. Absorption scans revealed biphasic degradation of phycocyanin color activity to about 30% within 30\u202fs at T\u202f\u2265\u202f70\u202f\u00b0C. Kinetic modelling of the color decay via an nth order approach contradicts previously assumed linear first order kinetics with a best fitting empirical reaction order of n\u202f=\u202f6. It shows that decay in phycocyanin color activity is not a single process but encompasses C-phycocyanin and allophycocyanin aggregate disintegration and denaturation.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  Central to this study is the color stability of phycocyanin, which is a high value component, derived from the emerging food source microalgae. It is also the only naturally obtained blue food coloring available to the food industry. Insights could be gained on the color degradation kinetics by treating an industry relevant formulation in batch and emerging scalable continuous systems via micro process engineering. This data will directly support food research and development activities to optimize and minimize blue color losses within multiple product categories.", "Possibilities for an in vitro meat production system ": "Meat produced in vitro has been proposed as a humane, safe and environmentally beneficial alternative to slaughtered animal flesh as a source of nutritional muscle tissue. The basic methodology of an in vitro meat production system (IMPS) involves culturing muscle tissue in a liquid medium on a large scale. Each component of the system offers an array of options which are described taking into account recent advances in relevant research. A major advantage of an IMPS is that the conditions are controlled and manipulatable. Limitations discussed include meeting nutritional requirements and large scale operation. The direction of further research and prospects regarding the future of in vitro meat production will be speculated.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  The development of an alternative meat production system is driven by the growing demand for meat and the shrinking resources available to produce it by current methods. Implementation of an in vitro meat production system (IMPS) to complement existing meat production practices creates the opportunity for meat products of different characteristics to be put onto the market. In vitro produced meat products resembling the processed and comminuted meat products of today will be sooner to develop than those resembling traditional cuts of meat. While widening the scope of the meat industry in practices and products, the IMPS will reduce the need for agricultural resources to produce meat.", "Effect of high pressure processing on the safety, shelf life and quality of raw milk ": "High pressure processing (HPP) was investigated as an alternative to standard raw milk processing. Different pressure levels (400\u2013600\u202fMPa) and exposure times (1\u20135\u202fmin) were tested against artificially inoculated pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. HPP effectively inactivated bacterial concentration by 5\u202flog\u202fCFU/ml. The most effective HPP conditions in terms of pathogen reduction were subsequently utilised to determine the effect of pressure on microbiological shelf life, particle size and colour of milk during refrigerated storage. Results were compared to pasteurised and raw milk. HPP (600\u202fMPa for 3\u202fmin) also significantly reduced the total viable counts, Enterobacteriaceae, lactic acid bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. in milk thus prolonging the microbiological shelf life of milk by 1\u202fweek compared to pasteurised milk. Particle size distribution curves of raw, pasteurised and HPP milk, showed that raw and HPP milk had more similar casein and fat particle sizes compared to pasteurised milk. The results of this study show the possibility of using HPP to eliminate pathogens present in milk while maintaining key quality characteristics similar to those of raw milk.", "Protein enrichment of defatted soybean flour by fine milling and electrostatic separation ": "Defatting and dry fractionation of soybean flour by the combination of impact milling and tribo-electrostatic separation was investigated to prepare protein\u2013enriched soybean flour. Defatting is crucial to facilitate dry milling required for dry fractionation. Both organic solvent extraction and oil pressing were suitable as defatting methods although oil pressing compacted the tissue structure visually. Moderate impact milling (classifier wheel speed of 3000\u202frpm) effectively liberated protein bodies while eliminating agglomeration of small particles. Electrostatic separation was conducted with varying charging tube configurations. We found higher yields in the separation with a spiral charging tube design than with a slit design. The soy flour was enriched in protein from 37\u202fg/100\u202fg to 45\u202fg/100\u202fg dry basis by defatting. During electrostatic separation a soy protein enrichment of 15% was achieved and a yield of 62% of the protein was recovered from the defatted soy flour.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial applications\n                  The production of soy protein isolates and soy protein concentrates with wet fractionation consumes a lot of water and energy. Meanwhile, the ingredients lose their native state and part of their functionality due to the harsh processing conditions. This study proposed a dry fractionation method combining fine milling and electrostatic separation for the preparation of soybean protein-enriched fractions retaining the native state of the protein. Although the proposed dry fractionation for protein-enriched fractions from oilseeds is promising, still challenges are ahead for upscaling the process, being efficient and safe in its operation.", "Applications and opportunities for ultrasound assisted extraction in the food industry \u2014 A review ": "Ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) process enhancement for food and allied industries are reported in this review. This includes herbal, oil, protein and bioactives from plant and animal materials (e.g. polyphenolics, anthocyanins, aromatic compounds, polysaccharides and functional compounds) with increased yield of extracted components, increased rate of extraction, achieving reduction in extraction time and higher processing throughput. Ultrasound can enhance existing extraction processes and enable new commercial extraction opportunities and processes. New UAE processing approaches have been proposed, including, (a) the potential for modification of plant cell material to provide improved bioavailability of micro-nutrients while retaining the natural-like quality, (b) simultaneous extraction and encapsulation, (c) quenching of the radical sonochemistry especially in aqueous systems to avoid degradation of bioactives and (d) potential use of the radical sonochemistry to achieve targeted hydroxylation of polyphenolics and carotenoids to increase bioactivity.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  The application of ultrasonic assisted extraction (UAE) in food processing technology is of interest for enhancing extraction of components from plant and animal materials. This review shows that UAE technology can potentially enhance extraction of components such as polyphenolics, anthocyanins, aromatic compounds, polysaccharides, oils and functional compounds when used as a pre-treatment step in a unit process. The higher yield obtained in these UAE processes are of major interest from an industrial point of view, since the technology is an \u201cadd on\u201d step to the existing process with minimum alteration, application in aqueous extraction where organic solvents can be replaced with generally recognised as safe (GRAS) solvents, reduction in solvent usage, and shortening the extraction time. The use of ultrasonic for extraction purposes in high-cost raw materials is an economical alternative to traditional extraction processes, which is an industry demand for a sustainable development.", "Closed-loop spray drying solutions for energy efficient powder production ": "This paper introduces a closed-loop dryer system to reduce the energy consumption for milk powder production. The system is based on a monodisperse droplet atomizer which reduces the amount of fines in the exhaust air, and allows dehumidification and recirculation of the air over the dryer. In this way the latent and sensible heat from the dryer exhaust are recovered. Two adsorbent systems for dehumidification are discussed; a membrane contactor with a liquid desiccant, and a zeolite sorption wheel. Four configurations for closed-loop spray drying are simulated and optimized. By heat integration of the adsorber-regenerator system with the dryer and preceding concentration step, the energy consumption is significantly reduced to 4.9\u202fMJ heat per kg milk powder. The final heat integration solutions were obtained by simultaneous optimization of the operational conditions and the heat exchanger network based on pinch analysis.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  Drying is an energy intensive operation in processing. To comply with the upcoming regulations that arise from the EU goals for sustainable development, the energy consumption of drying processes should be reduced drastically. Emerging technologies are the key for the next step in energy efficiency improvement. A closed-loop spray drying system for milk powder production is simulated and optimized in this work. The proposed technologies are: monodisperse droplet drying, membrane contactor and a zeolite wheel. By applying air dehumidification and heat integration the latent and sensible heat are recovered from the exhaust air. The energy consumption for milk concentration and spray drying has the potential to be lowered from 8.4 to 4.9\u202fMJ heat per kg milk powder. Although milk powder has been considered, the proposed system is also applicable to other food products, as well as in the (bio)chemical, pharmaceutical and paper industry.", "Important factors to consider for acrylamide mitigation in potato crisps using pulsed electric fields ": "This preliminary study aimed to compare the application of pulsed electric field (PEF) with a traditional blanching as pre-treatments before frying for the mitigation of acrylamide content in potato crisps.\n                  Measuring the degree of cell disintegration index (p\n                     \n                        o\n                     ) and the changes in water electrical conductivity during washing of potato slices, PEF protocol and sample preparation scheme were optimized. Peeled potato slices (thickness 1.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fmm) were subjected to PEF (1.5\u202fkV/cm, pulse duration 10\u202f\u03bcs, total treatment time 10\u202fms, pulse frequency 100\u202fHz) and to blanching (85\u202f\u00b0C for 3.5\u202fmin) pre-treatments and then to washing in water, evaluating the reduction of acrylamide precursors (reducing sugars and free asparagine). After frying (175\u202f\u00b0C, 3\u202fmin), product quality, in terms of colour, texture and acrylamide content were evaluated. Results showed that PEF promoted acrylamide precursors leaching followed by a reduction of the final acrylamide content of around 30%, significantly higher if compared to the reduction obtained with blanching, with only slight modifications of the final quality of the product, in terms of colour and texture.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  The Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2158 of 20 November 2017 has introduced new benchmark levels and mitigation strategies for the reduction of the presence of acrylamide in foods, directing food businesses to the research of measures to lower the acrylamide formation in foods. The actual industrial production process of fried potato crisps involves the use of many mitigation strategies, such as a blanching of raw potatoes. However, the traditional blanching treatment presents several practical drawbacks and leads to undesirable changes of the product quality. The application of PEF as a pre-treatment could reduce the acrylamide content in deep-fat fried potato crisps. This preliminary study gives important indications regarding the possibility of combining a PEF pre-treatment on raw potato slices with subsequent industrial processing steps for the production of potato crisps with low acrylamide concentration.", "Production of a \u03b2-d-glucan-rich extract from Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes) by an extraction/microfiltration/reverse osmosis (nanofiltration) process ": "A pilot-scale process combining extraction of Shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) powder in water (98\u202f\u00b0C, 1\u202fh), cross-flow microfiltration and reverse osmosis (nanofiltration) was performed to obtain \u03b2-glucan-rich extracts. Suspensions (45\u201380\u202fL) obtained after 3 extractions were clarified by microfiltration reducing their turbidity to <1\u202fNTU. Membrane flux was completely recovered after filtration. One of the clarified extracts was concentrated (to 6\u20137\u202fL) by reverse osmosis (Nanomax95) and the other two by nanofiltration (Nanomax50 and ALNF99-2517). Different physicochemical parameters (permeate flux, total soluble substances, total suspended particles and electrical conductivity) were monitored during filtration and the bioactive compounds present in the obtained fractions (\u03b2-glucans, total carbohydrates, chitins, eritadenine, lenthionine, ergosterol) were analyzed. The more adequate membrane for Shiitake extract concentration was Nanomax50 because it showed higher filtration flux and higher values of bioactive compounds in the obtained extract than the extracts obtained with the other two membranes.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  This work describes a pilot-scale procedure for obtaining \u03b2-d-glucan-rich extracts from Lentinula edodes (Shiitake mushrooms). The extracts might be used in novel functional foods due to their high content in hypocholesterolemic compounds. The process combines extraction with boiling water, cross-flow membrane clarification and reverse osmosis/nanofiltration concentration of \u03b2-d-glucans. The procedure is scalable to industrial level.", "Unlocking the biological potential of proteins from edible insects through enzymatic hydrolysis: A review ": "This review, focusing on studies published between 2005 and 2017, analysed the literature on the generation of bioactive peptides (BAPs) from edible insect proteins following enzymatic hydrolysis. The protein extraction and quantification methodologies used for edible insects varied considerably. While several edible insects have been evaluated for their ability to release BAPs, silkworm (Bombyx mori) is currently the most studied. Specifically, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant and antidiabetic properties of edible insect protein enzymatic hydrolysates have been studied. Potent in vitro ACE inhibitory and antioxidant hydrolysates/peptides have been reported. In certain instances, these properties were validated in small animal studies (i.e. hypotensive effects). Enzymatic hydrolysis of edible insect proteins may also enhance technofunctional properties (i.e. solubility). The wider application of enzymatic hydrolysis protocols to edible insect proteins may ultimately allow for the increased discovery and utilisation of novel BAPs as sustainable protein/peptide sources for human nutrition.", "Combined radio frequency-vacuum and hot air drying of kiwifruits: Effect on drying uniformity, energy efficiency and product quality ": "Two drying methods, both individually and in their combination [RF-vacuum drying (RFVD), hot air drying (HAD) and RFVD+HAD] were evaluated for three-layer drying of 6\u202fmm thick kiwifruit slices in order to shorten drying time, improve energy efficiency and product quality. An electrode gap of 95\u202fmm and vacuum of 20.1\u202fkPa were selected for RFVD applications based on previous studies. Results showed that the total drying time was the shortest (480\u202fmin) when using RFVD, followed by RFVD+HAD (600\u202fmin; 20% longer) and HAD (900\u202fmin, almost double). However, non-uniform drying patterns were observed in both RFVD and HAD methods, but the RFVD+HAD process resulted in a more uniform moisture distribution both within and among the fruit slices. The average energy efficiency of HAD was improved remarkably from 9.92% to 22.93% by applying the RFVD+HAD method. Additionally, the RFVD+HAD process resulted in better product quality attributes like color, shrinkage ratio and rehydration capacity. Therefore, the RFVD+HAD method is recommended as a time and energy efficient drying technology for kiwifruits with a better moisture distribution and product quality.", "Whole soybean protein extraction processes: A review ": "Soybeans are an important raw material for those seeking vegan, lactose-free products, such as soymilk and tofu. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of aqueous extraction of protein and other desirable components from whole soybeans. Firstly, a discussion over the microstructure of the soybean is held, including a summary of protein localisation and properties. A detailed review of common whole soybean extraction process is then given, along with extraction process parameters and process intensification steps that can improve yield. A novel extraction model is presented, based on a mass balance of the water phases. The extraction model reveals separation as the main limitation for protein recovery during aqueous soy protein extraction due to the high amount of okara waste stream and its high moisture content.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  Typically, the extraction of protein from an intermediate soy-protein ingredient is studied at lab-scale. Within industry, aqueous extract from whole soybeans is commonly used for making consumer products containing both soy protein and soybean oil, and this has been the focus of this review. Key extraction process parameters are presented and challenges of each extraction step are given for the whole soybean extraction process. A novel model for determining the separation efficiency has been presented, which is useful for many other extraction systems that contain components of interest in high amounts of waste stream.", "Dietary fibre and phytochemical characteristics of fruit and vegetable by-products and their recent applications as novel ingredients in food products ": "Presently, producers are striving to create products which contain a value added factor, such as dietary fibre or in more recent times, phytochemicals. The production and addition of such nutrients can be quite costly for the producer. In the fruit and vegetable industry, the preparation and processing procedures can lead to one third of the product being discarded. This can be costly for the manufacturer and also may have a negative impact on the environment. Research has shown that these by-products can have a high nutritional value. It has also been suggested, that they could be used as a food ingredient due to their functional abilities such as gelling and water binding. The focus of this review is on the nutritional and functional properties of the by-products of food processing and their potential applications as nutritional new ingredients in foods.\n               \n               \n                  Industrial relevance\n                  Processors are constantly trying to utilize as much of their product as possible, and this paper puts forward an alternative use for their \u2018waste\u2019 which would be of a significant benefit to their business.This new food ingredient contains a nutritional benefit, such as dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals and bio-actives such as flavonoids and lycopene.Due to the nature of the by-products, functionally they hold such properties as increased water holding and binding, gelling and thickening.This review suggests a solution for creating a cheaper value-added ingredient which in turn decreases the present ways of disposing these by-products (which can be harmful to the environment), while also saving the producer's money.Ingredient companies are continually looking for cheaper but value-added ingredients; this paper reflects the opportunity for fruit and vegetable byproducts.", "Refugia and anthelmintic resistance: Concepts and challenges ": "Anthelmintic resistance is a threat to global food security. In order to alleviate the selection pressure for resistance and maintain drug efficacy, management strategies increasingly aim to preserve a proportion of the parasite population in \u2018refugia\u2019, unexposed to treatment. While persuasive in its logic, and widely advocated as best practice, evidence for the ability of refugia-based approaches to slow the development of drug resistance in parasitic helminths is currently limited. Moreover, the conditions needed for refugia to work, or how transferable those are between parasite-host systems, are not known. This review, born of an international workshop, seeks to deconstruct the concept of refugia and examine its assumptions and applicability in different situations. We conclude that factors potentially important to refugia, such as the fitness cost of drug resistance, the degree of mixing between parasite sub-populations selected through treatment or not, and the impact of parasite life-history, genetics and environment on the population dynamics of resistance, vary widely between systems. The success of attempts to generate refugia to limit anthelmintic drug resistance are therefore likely to be highly dependent on the system in hand. Additional research is needed on the concept of refugia and the underlying principles for its application across systems, as well as empirical studies within systems that prove and optimise its usefulness.", "Perspectives on the utility of moxidectin for the control of parasitic nematodes in the face of developing anthelmintic resistance ": "Macrocyclic lactone (ML) anthelmintics are the most important class of anthelmintics because of our high dependence on them for the control of nematode parasites and some ectoparasites in livestock, companion animals and in humans. However, resistance to MLs is of increasing concern. Resistance is commonplace throughout the world in nematode parasites of small ruminants and is of increasing concern in horses, cattle, dogs and other animals. It is suspected in Onchocerca volvulus in humans. In most animals, resistance first arose to the avermectins, such as ivermectin (IVM), and subsequently to moxidectin (MOX). Usually when parasite populations are ML-resistant, MOX is more effective than avermectins. MOX may have higher intrinsic potency against some parasites, especially filarial nematodes, than the avermectins. However, it clearly has a significantly different pharmacokinetic profile. It is highly distributed to lipid tissues, less likely to be removed by ABC efflux transporters, is poorly metabolized and has a long half-life. This results in effective concentrations persisting for longer in target hosts. It also has a high safety index. Limited data suggest that anthelmintic resistance may be overcome, at least temporarily, if a high concentration can be maintained at the site of the parasites for a prolonged period of time. Because of the properties of MOX, there are reasonable prospects that strains of parasites that are resistant to avermectins at currently recommended doses will be controlled by MOX if it can be administered at sufficiently high doses and in formulations that enhance its persistence in the host. This review examines the properties of MOX that support this contention and compares them with the properties of other MLs. The case for using MOX to better control ML-resistant parasites is summarised and some outstanding research questions are presented.", "Route map for the discovery and pre-clinical development of new drugs and treatments for cutaneous leishmaniasis ": "Although there have been significant advances in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and several novel compounds are currently in pre-clinical and clinical development for this manifestation of leishmaniasis, there have been limited advances in drug research and development (R & D) for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Here we review the need for new treatments for CL, describe in vitro and in vivo assays, models and approaches taken over the past decade to establish a pathway for the discovery, and pre-clinical development of new drugs for CL. These recent advances include novel mouse models of infection using bioluminescent Leishmania, the introduction of PK/PD approaches to skin infection, and defined pre-clinical candidate profiles.", "Current treatment options for Dientamoeba fragilis infections ": "Dientamoeba fragilis belongs to the trichomonad group of protozoan parasites and it has been implicated as a cause of gastrointestinal disease with world-wide prevalences ranging from 0.5% to 16%. The majority of patients with dientamoebiasis present with gastrointestinal complaints. Chronic symptoms are common with up to a third of patients exhibiting persistent diarrhoea. Numerous studies have successfully demonstrated parasite clearance, coupled with complete resolution of clinical symptoms following treatment with various antiparasitic compounds. Treatments reported to be successful for dientamoebiasis include carbarsone, diphetarsone, tetracyclines, paromomycin, erythromycin, hydroxyquinolines and the 5-nitroimidazoles, including metronidazole, secnidazole, tinidazole and ornidazole. It is of note that most current treatment data is based only on small number of case reports. No large scale double blind randomised placebo controlled trials testing the efficacy of antimicrobial agents against D. fragilis has been undertaken highlighting the need for further study. In addition there is very little in vitro susceptibility data available for the organism making some current treatment options questionable. The aim of this review is to critically discuss all treatment options currently available for dientamoebiasis.", "Mining for natural product antileishmanials in a fungal extract library ": "Leishmaniasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease caused by the insect-vector borne protozoan parasite, Leishmania species. Infection affects millions of the World's poorest, however vaccines are absent and drug therapy limited. Recently, public-private partnerships have developed to identify new modes of controlling leishmaniasis. Most of these collaborative efforts have relied upon the small molecule synthetic compound libraries held by industry, but the number of New Chemical Entities (NCE) identified and entering development as antileishmanials has been very low. In light of this, here we describe a public-private effort to identify natural products with activity against Leishmania mexicana, a causative agent of cutaneous leishmanaisis (CL). Utilising Hypha Discovery's fungal extract library which is rich in small molecule (<500 molecular weight) secondary metabolites, we undertook an iterative phenotypic screening and fractionation approach to identify potent and selective antileishmanial hits. This led to the identification of a novel oxidised bisabolane sesquiterpene which demonstrated activity in an infected cell model and was shown to disrupt multiple processes using a metabolomic approach. In addition, and importantly, this study also sets a precedent for new approaches for CL drug discovery.", "Novel chemical starting points for drug discovery in leishmaniasis and Chagas disease ": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and Chagas disease (CD) are caused by kinetoplastid parasites that affect millions of people worldwide and impart a heavy burden against human health. Due to the partial efficacy and toxicity-related limitations of the existing treatments, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapies with superior efficacy and safety profiles to successfully treat these diseases. Herein we report the application of whole-cell phenotypic assays to screen a set of 150,000 compounds against Leishmania donovani, a causative agent of VL, and Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of CD, with the objective of finding new starting points to develop novel drugs to effectively treat and control these diseases. The screening campaign, conducted with the purpose of global open access, identified twelve novel chemotypes with low to sub-micromolar activity against T. cruzi and/or L. donovani. We disclose these hit structures and associated activity with the goal to contribute to the drug discovery community by providing unique chemical tools to probe kinetoplastid biology and as hit-to-lead candidates for drug discovery.", "Novel benzoxaborole, nitroimidazole and aminopyrazoles with activity against experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis ": "Objectives\n                  Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) has identified three chemical lead series, the nitroimidazoles, benzoxaboroles and aminopyrazoles, as innovative treatments for visceral leishmaniasis. The leads discovered using phenotypic screening, were optimised following disease- and compound-specific criteria. Several leads of each series were progressed and preclinical drug candidates have been nominated. Here we evaluate the efficacy of the lead compounds of each of these three chemical classes in in vitro and in vivo models of cutaneous leishmaniasis.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  The in vitro activity of fifty-five compounds was evaluated against the intracellular amastigotes of L. major, L. aethiopica, L. amazonensis, L. panamensis, L. mexicana and L. tropica. The drugs demonstrating potent activity (EC50\u202f<\u202f5\u202f\u03bcM) against at least 4 of 6 species were subsequently evaluated in vivo in different L. major \u2013 BALB/c mouse models using a 5 or 10-day treatment with either the oral or topical formulations. Efficacy was expressed as lesion size (measured daily using callipers), parasite load (by quantitative PCR \u2013 DNA) and bioluminescence signal reduction relative to the untreated controls.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The selected drug compounds (3 nitroimidazoles, 1 benzoxaborole and 3 aminopyrazoles) showed consistent and potent activity across a range of Leishmania species that are known to cause CL with EC50 values ranging from 0.29 to 18.3\u202f\u03bcM. In all cases, this potent in vitro antileishmanial activity translated into high levels of efficacy with a linear dose-response against murine CL. When administered at 50\u202fmg/kg/day, DNDI-0690 (nitroimidazole), DNDI-1047 (aminopyrazole) and DNDI-6148 (benzoxaborole) all resulted in a significant lesion size reduction (no visible nodule) and an approximate 2-log-fold reduction of the parasite load as measured by qPCR compared to the untreated control.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The lead compounds DNDI-0690, DNDI-1047 and DNDI-6148 showed excellent activity across a range of Leishmania species in vitro and against L. major in mice. These compounds offer novel potential drugs for the treatment of CL.", "Screening the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pathogen Box against piroplasm parasites ": "Diminazene aceturate (DA) and imidocarb dipropionate are commonly used in livestock as antipiroplasm agents. However, toxic side effects are common in animals treated with these two drugs. Therefore, evaluations of novel therapeutic agents with high efficacy against piroplasm parasites and low toxicity to host animals are of paramount importance. In this study, the 400 compounds in the Pathogen Box provided by the Medicines for Malaria Venture foundation were screened against Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, Babesia caballi, and Theileria equi. A fluorescence-based method using SYBR Green 1 stain was used for initial in vitro screening and determination of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The initial in vitro screening performed using a 1\u202f\u03bcM concentration as baseline revealed nine effective compounds against four tested parasites. Two \u201chit\u201d compounds, namely MMV021057 and MMV675968, that showed IC50\u202f<\u202f0.3\u202f\u03bcM and a selectivity index (SI)> 100 were selected. The IC50s of MMV021057 and MMV675968 against B. bovis, B. bigemina, T. equi and B. caballi were 23, 39, 229, and 146\u202fnM, and 2.9, 3, 25.7, and 2.9\u202fnM, respectively. In addition, a combination of MMV021057 and DA showed additive or synergistic effects against four tested parasites, while combinations of MMV021057 with MMV675968 and of MMV675968 with DA showed antagonistic effects. In mice, treated with 50\u202fmg/kg MMV021057 and 25\u202fmg/kg MMV675968 inhibited the growth of Babesia microti by 54 and 64%, respectively, as compared to the untreated group on day 8. Interestingly, a combination treatment with 6.25\u202fmg/kg DA and 25\u202fmg/kg MMV021057 inhibited B. microti by 91.6%, which was a stronger inhibition than that by single treatments with 50\u202fmg/kg MMV021057 and 25\u202fmg/kg DA, which showed 54 and 83% inhibition, respectively. Our findings indicated that MMV021057, MMV675968, and the combination treatment with MMV021057 and DA are prospects for further development of antipiroplasm drugs.", "\n               Plasmodium falciparum in\u00a0vitro continuous culture conditions: A comparison of parasite susceptibility and tolerance to anti-malarial drugs throughout the asexual intra-erythrocytic life cycle ": "The continuous culture of Plasmodium falciparum is often seen as a means to an end, that end being to probe the biology of the parasite in question, and ultimately for many in the malaria drug discovery arena, to identify means of killing the parasite in order to treat malaria. In\u00a0vitro continuous culture of Plasmodium falciparum is a fundamental requirement when undertaking malaria research where the primary objectives utilise viable parasites of a desired lifecycle stage. This investigation, and resulting data, compared the impact culturing Plasmodium falciparum long term (4 months) in different environmental conditions had on experimental outcomes and thus conclusions. The example presented here focused specifically on the effect culture conditions had on the in\u00a0vitro tolerance of Plasmodium falciparum to standard anti-malarial drugs, including artemisinin and lumefantrine. Historical data from an independent experiment for 3D7-ALB (5% O2) was also compared with that obtained from this study. We concluded that parasites cultured for several months in media supplemented with a serum substitute such as Albumax II\u00ae or within hyperoxic conditions (21% O2), demonstrate highly variable responses to artemisinin and lumefantrine but not all anti-malarial drugs, when compared to those cultured in human serum in combination with Albumax II\u00ae under normoxic conditions (5% O2) for the parasite.", "Resistance formation to nitro drugs in Giardia lamblia: No common markers identified by comparative proteomics ": "In order to elucidate the question whether resistance to nitro drugs in G. lamblia is due to common resistance markers, trophozoites of three resistant G. lamblia strains, namely C4, 1062ID10, and 713M3 were grown in the presence of the two nitro drugs metronidazole and nitazoxanide and compared to their corresponding wild-types WBC6, 106, and 713 by mass spectometry shotgun analysis of their proteomes. Depending on the strain and the nitro drug, more than 200 to 500 differentially expressed proteins were identified, but there were no common patterns across strains and drugs. All resistant strains underwent antigenic variation with distinct surface antigens like variant surface proteins or cysteine rich proteins depending on strain and nitro compound. A closer look on enzymes involved in nitroreduction and detoxification of nitro radicals, NO or O2 suggested the existence of distinct strategies for each drug and each strain. Therefore, we conclude that resistance to nitro drugs in G. lamblia is not correlated with a specific pattern of differentially expressed proteins and therefore seems not to be the result of a directed process.", "Aminoguanidines: New leads for treatment of Giardia duodenalis infection ": "Giardia duodenalis is an ubiquitous parasitic pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Failures in drug therapy are commonly due to poor patient compliance as a result of the need for repeated administration, off target drug effects and increasing parasite drug resistance. In this study the in vitro efficacy and selectivity of the aminoguanidine compound robenidine and 2 structural analogues against Giardia were determined. After 5\u202fh exposure to each compound the IC50 was as low as 0.2\u202f\u03bcM with corresponding MLCs as low as 2.8\u202f\u03bcM. This is in contrast to metronidazole which required 24\u202fh to exhibit inhibitory activity. A modified adherence assay, developed for this study, demonstrated that three of the compounds inhibited in vitro adherence of the parasite. The lead compound exhibited rapid giardicidal activity (<5hr). In addition, microscopy studies demonstrated damage to the plasma membrane of trophozoites. In conclusion, a class of aminoguanidines, represented by robenidine, has shown antigiardial activity warranting further investigation.", "Macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic-induced leukocyte binding to Dirofilaria immitis microfilariae: Influence of the drug resistance status of the parasite ": "The macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics are the only class of drug currently used to prevent heartworm disease. Their extremely high potency in vivo is not mirrored by their activity against Dirofilaria immitis larvae in vitro, leading to suggestions that they may require host immune functions to kill the parasites. We have previously shown that ivermectin stimulates the binding of canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to D. immitis microfilariae (Mf). We have now extended these studies to moxidectin and examined the ability of both drugs to stimulate canine PBMC and PMN attachment to Mf from multiple strains of D. immitis, including two that are proven to be resistant to ivermectin in vivo. Both ivermectin and moxidectin significantly increased the percentage of drug-susceptible parasites with cells attached at very low concentrations (<10\u202fnM), but much higher concentrations of ivermectin (>100\u202fnM) were required to increase the percentage of the two resistant strains, Yazoo-2013 and Metairie-2014, with cells attached. Moxidectin increased the percentage of the two resistant strains with cells attached at lower concentrations (<10\u202fnM) than did ivermectin. The attachment of the PBMCs and PMNs did not result in any parasite killing in vitro. These data support the biological relevance of the drug-stimulated attachment of canine leukocytes to D. immitis Mf and suggest that this phenomenon is related to the drug resistance status of the parasites.", "\n               Plasmodium knowlesi exhibits distinct in vitro drug susceptibility profiles from those of Plasmodium falciparum\n             ": "New antimalarial agents are identified and developed after extensive testing on Plasmodium falciparum parasites that can be grown in vitro. These susceptibility studies are important to inform lead optimisation and support further drug development. Until recently, little was known about the susceptibility of non-falciparum species as these had not been adapted to in vitro culture. The recent culture adaptation of P. knowlesi has therefore offered an opportunity to routinely define the drug susceptibility of this species, which is phylogenetically closer to all other human malarias than is P. falciparum. We compared the in vitro susceptibility of P. knowlesi and P. falciparum to a range of established and novel antimalarial agents under identical assay conditions. We demonstrated that P. knowlesi is significantly less susceptible than P. falciparum to six of the compounds tested; and notably these include three ATP4 inhibitors currently under development as novel antimalarial agents, and one investigational antimalarial, AN13762, which is 67 fold less effective against P. knowlesi. For the other compounds there was a less than two-fold difference in susceptibility between species. We then compared the susceptibility of a recent P. knowlesi isolate, UM01, to that of the well-established, older A1-H.1 clone. This recent isolate showed similar in vitro drug susceptibility to the A1-H.1 clone, supporting the ongoing use of the better characterised clone to further study drug susceptibility. Lastly, we used isobologram analysis to explore the interaction of a selection of drug combinations and showed similar drug interactions across species. The species differences in drug susceptibility reported by us here and previously, support adding in vitro drug screens against P. knowlesi to those using P. falciparum strains to inform new drug discovery and lead optimisation.", "Novel and safe single-dose treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis with implantable amphotericin B-loaded microparticles ": "The development of an effective amphotericin B (AmB) topical formulation to replace the systemically toxic injections currently used in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) treatment is challenging due to poor absorption through the skin. Aiming at an effective local chemotherapy, we designed PLGA (poly(lactide-co-glycolide acid) microparticles loaded with deoxycholate amphotericin B (d-AmB) for both macrophage intracellular targeting and sustained extracellular release. For that, d-AmB/PLGA microparticles with sizes ranging from 0.5\u202f\u03bcm to 20\u202f\u03bcm were synthesized and tested both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, d-AmB/PLGA was more selectively active against intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis than free d-AmB (selectivity index\u202f=\u202f50 and 25, respectively). In vivo, the efficacy of a single intralesional (i.l) injection with d-AmB/PLGA was determined in early and established BALB/c mouse ear lesions. In early lesions, a single injection given on day 10 of infection was more effective in controlling parasite growth than eight i.l. injections with free d-AmB, as measured on day 120. Such d-AmB/PLGA injection was also effective in established lesions (day 30), leading to 97% parasite burden reduction, as compared with d-AmB or liposomal AmB (Ambisome\u00ae) i.l. injection containing the same AmB dose. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that following d-AmB/PLGA injection, AmB leaked slower from non-infected than infected ears, yet remaining in the ear tissue for as long as 30 days. Of interest, AmB was not detectable in the circulating plasma for at least two weeks of d-AmB/PLGA injection, contrasting with the rapid and durable (2 days) detection after free d-AmB injection. Despite the transient ear swelling and local cell infiltration, no alterations in AST, ALT and creatinine serum levels was induced by d-AmB/PLGA. For its approved components, local efficacy, and single-dose applicability, this novel and safe AmB microparticle depot formulation has strong potential as a new therapy for human CL.", "Drug repurposing and human parasitic protozoan diseases ": "Parasitic diseases have an enormous health, social and economic impact and are a particular problem in tropical regions of the world. Diseases caused by protozoa and helminths, such as malaria and schistosomiasis, are the cause of most parasite related morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 1.1million combined deaths annually. The global burden of these diseases is exacerbated by the lack of licensed vaccines, making safe and effective drugs vital to their prevention and treatment. Unfortunately, where drugs are available, their usefulness is being increasingly threatened by parasite drug resistance. The need for new drugs drives antiparasitic drug discovery research globally and requires a range of innovative strategies to ensure a sustainable pipeline of lead compounds. In this review we discuss one of these approaches, drug repurposing or repositioning, with a focus on major human parasitic protozoan diseases such as malaria, trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis and leishmaniasis.", "High-resolution melt (HRM) analysis for detection of SNPs associated with pyrethroid resistance in the southern cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae) ": "The southern cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, is the most economically important ectoparasite of cattle worldwide. A limitation for sustainable control and eradication is the emergence of acaricide resistance among tick populations. Molecular diagnostic tools offer the opportunity to detect resistance rapidly, which can be complemented with confirmatory bioassays with larvae and adult ticks that are more resource and time consuming to generate. Synthetic pyrethroid resistance is one of the most prevalent and well-studied forms of resistance in arthropods, being linked with target site alterations in the sodium ion channel gene. Here, we report research on a novel molecular method to detect mutations in the para-sodium channel gene of R. microplus associated with acaricide resistance that is based on quantitative PCR high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis. Genomic DNA fragments of domains II and III of the para-sodium channel gene were amplified by real-time PCR in the presence of EVA\u00aeGreen dye to test resistant and susceptible reference ticks from the U.S., Brazil, and Mexico. Larval packet tests with discriminating doses and a modified lethal time analysis were performed to confirm resistance to permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and flumethrin in laboratory strains. Tick specimens collected from cattle that were inspected at the United States Port-of-Entry at the Texas-Mexico border were also genotyped. Previously described mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance (T170C, C190A, G184C, and T2134A) were successfully detected by qPCR-HRM in different genotypes and confirmed by sequencing. A novel non-synonymous SNP located at domain III (C2136A) and the G215T mutation in domain II, previously described only in Asian R. microplus and R. australis, were also detected with the HRM and confirmed by sequencing. This technique could be adapted for high-throughput screening, detection, and discovery of allele-specific mutations in cattle tick outbreak populations to inform eradication strategies in the USA. This knowledge could also be applied to integrated control programs in other parts of the world where R. microplus is endemic and where similar SNPs have been identified associated with pyrethroid resistance. This study highlights the existence of several mutations in the para-sodium channel gene in different combinations in field populations of R. microplus from Mexico.", "A high-throughput screen for the identification of compounds that inhibit nematode gene expression by targeting spliced leader trans-splicing ": "Infections with parasitic nematodes are among the most significant of the neglected tropical diseases affecting about a billion people living mainly in tropical regions with low economic activity.\n                  The most effective current strategy to control nematode infections involves large scale treatment programs with anthelmintic drugs. This strategy is at risk from the emergence of drug resistant parasites. Parasitic nematodes also affect livestock, which are treated with the same limited group of anthelmintic drugs. Livestock parasites resistant to single drugs, and even multi-drug resistant parasites, are appearing in many areas. There is therefore a pressing need for new anthelmintic drugs.\n                  Here we use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model for parasitic nematodes and demonstrate that sinefungin, a competitive inhibitor of methyltransferases, causes a delay in development and reduced fecundity, and inhibits spliced leader trans-splicing. Spliced leader trans-splicing is an essential step in gene expression that does not occur in the hosts of parasitic nematodes, and is therefore a potential target for new anthelmintic drugs.\n                  We have exploited the ability of sinefungin to inhibit spliced leader trans-splicing to adapt a green fluorescent protein based reporter gene assay that monitors spliced leader trans-splicing for high-throughput screening for new anthelmintic compounds. We have established a protocol for robust high-throughput screening, combining mechanical dispensing of living C. elegans into 384- or 1536- well plates with addition of compounds using an acoustic liquid dispenser, and the detection of the inhibition of SL trans-splicing using a microplate reader. We have tested this protocol in a first pilot screen and envisage that this assay will be a valuable tool in the search for new anthelmintic drugs.", "Selected \u03b1-pyrones from the plants Cryptocarya novoguineensis (Lauraceae) and Piper methysticum (Piperaceae) with activity against Haemonchus contortus in vitro ": "Due to the widespread occurrence and spread of anthelmintic resistance, there is a need to develop new drugs against resistant parasitic nematodes of livestock animals. The Nobel Prize-winning discovery and development of the anti-parasitic drugs avermectin and artemisinin has renewed the interest in exploring natural products as anthelmintics. In the present study, we screened 7500 plant extracts for in vitro-activity against the barber's pole worm, Haemonchus contortus, a highly significant pathogen of ruminants. The anthelmintic extracts from two plants, Cryptocarya novoguineensis and Piper methysticum, were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Subsequently, compounds were purified from fractions with significant biological activity. Four \u03b1-pyrones, namely goniothalamin (GNT), dihydrokavain (DHK), desmethoxyyangonin (DMY) and yangonin (YGN), were purified from fractions from the two plants, GNT from C. novoguineensis, and DHK, DMY and YGN (= kavalactones) from P. methysticum. The three kavalactones induced a lethal, eviscerated (Evi) phenotype in treated exsheathed third-stage larvae (xL3s), and DMY and YGN had moderate potencies (IC50 values of 31.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23\u202f\u03bcM and 23.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.05\u202f\u03bcM, respectively) at inhibiting the development of xL3s to fourth-stage larvae (L4s). Although GNT had limited potency (IC50 of 200\u2013300\u202f\u03bcM) at inhibiting L4 development, it was the only compound that reduced L4 motility (IC50 of 6.25\u201312.50\u202f\u03bcM). The compounds purified from each plant affected H. contortus in an irreversible manner. These findings suggest that structure-activity relationship studies of \u03b1-pyrones should be pursued to assess their potential as anthelmintics.", "Investigation of the pathways related to intrinsic miltefosine tolerance in Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis clinical isolates reveals differences in drug uptake ": "In Brazil, cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused predominantly by L. (V.) braziliensis. The few therapeutic drugs available exhibit several limitations, mainly related to drug toxicity and reduced efficacy in some regions. Miltefosine (MF), the only oral drug available for leishmaniasis treatment, is not widely available and has not yet been approved for human use in Brazil. Our group previously reported the existence of differential susceptibility among L. (V.) braziliensis clinical isolates. In this work, we further characterized three of these isolates of L. (V.) braziliensis chosen because they exhibited the lowest and the highest MF half maximal inhibitory concentrations and were therefore considered less tolerant or more tolerant, respectively. Uptake of MF, and also of phosphocholine, were found to be significantly different in more tolerant parasites compared to the less sensitive isolate, which raised the hypothesis of differences in the MF transport complex Miltefosine Transporter (MT)-Ros3. Although some polymorphisms in those genes were found, they did not correlate with the drug susceptibility phenotype. Drug efflux and compartmentalization were similar in the isolates tested, and amphotericin B susceptibility was retained in MF tolerant parasites, suggesting that increased fitness was also not the basis of observed differences. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ros3 mRNA levels were upregulated in the sensitive strain compared to the tolerant ones. Increased mRNA abundance in more tolerant isolates was validated by quantitative PCR. Our results suggest that differential gene expression of the MT transporter complex is the basis of the differential susceptibility in these unselected, naturally occurring parasites.", "New life for an old drug: In vitro and in vivo effects of the anthelmintic drug niclosamide against Toxoplasma gondii RH strain ": "Toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis and causes serious public health problems. However, the current treatment drugs have many limitations, such as serious side effects. Niclosamide is a salicylanilide drug commonly used to treat worm infections. Herein, the effectiveness of niclosamide for the treatment of T. gondii infection was demonstrated. This study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo activities of niclosamide against T. gondii and to explore its mechanism of action. The in vitro cytotoxicity of niclosamide on human foreskin fibroblast cells was evaluated by MTT test. Niclosamide displayed low host toxicity and its 50% inhibitory concentration was 8.3\u202f\u03bcg/mL. The in vitro anti-proliferation and anti-invasion effects of niclosamide on T. gondii were determined by quantitative PCR and Giemsa staining. Niclosamide also inhibited T. gondii tachyzoite proliferation, with a 50% effective concentration of 45.3\u202fng/mL, and reduced the invasion of cells by tachyzoites (17.8% for the parasite control versus 1.9% for the niclosamide group treated with 100\u202fng/mL). A model was established by infecting BALB/c mice with the virulent RH strain of T. gondii and used to determine the in vivo effects of niclosamide on acute infection. The mice infected with tachyzoites and treated with 160, 200 or 240\u202fmg/kg\u00b7bw niclosamide for 7 days exhibited 20%, 40% and 50% survival, respectively. In addition, niclosamide reduced the parasite burden in the blood and tissues of acutely infected mice, and niclosamide induced decreases in the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in extracellular tachyzoites, as assessed by laser confocal microscopy and a multilabel reader. These findings indicated that the mechanism of action of niclosamide might be associated with T. gondii mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation. In conclusion, our results support the efficacy of niclosamide as a potential compound for the treatment of T. gondii infection.", "Overexpression of plasmepsin II and plasmepsin III does not directly cause reduction in Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity to artesunate, chloroquine and piperaquine ": "Artemisinin derivatives and their partner drugs in artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) have played a pivotal role in global malaria mortality reduction during the last two decades. The loss of artemisinin efficacy due to evolving drug-resistant parasites could become a serious global health threat. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is a well tolerated and generally highly effective ACT. The implementation of a partner drug in ACTs is critical in the control of emerging artemisinin resistance. Even though artemisinin is highly effective in parasite clearance, it is labile in the human body. A partner drug is necessary for killing the remaining parasites when the pulses of artemisinin have ceased. A population of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Cambodia and adjacent countries has become resistant to piperaquine. Increased copy number of the genes encoding the haemoglobinases Plasmepsin II and Plasmepsin III has been linked with piperaquine resistance by genome-wide association studies and in clinical trials, leading to the use of increased plasmepsin II/plasmepsin III copy number as a molecular marker for piperaquine resistance. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of plasmepsin II and plasmepsin III in the 3D7 genetic background failed to change the susceptibility of P. falciparum to artemisinin, chloroquine and piperaquine by both a standard dose-response analysis and a piperaquine survival assay. Whilst plasmepsin copy number polymorphism is currently implemented as a molecular surveillance resistance marker, further studies to discover the molecular basis of piperaquine resistance and potential epistatic interactions are needed.", "Leveraging the Medicines for Malaria Venture malaria and pathogen boxes to discover chemical inhibitors of East Coast fever ": "Chemotherapy of East Coast fever, a lymphoproliferative cancer-like disease of cattle causing significant economic losses in Africa, is largely dependent on the use of buparvaquone, a drug that was developed in the late 1980's. The disease is caused by the tick-borne protozoan pathogen Theileria parva. Buparvaquone can be used prophylactically and it is also active against tropical theileriosis, caused by the related parasite Theileria annulata. Recently, drug resistance was reported in T.\u00a0annulata, and could occur in T.\u00a0parva. Using a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay we screened 796 open source compounds from the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) to discover novel chemicals with potential inhibitory activity to T.\u00a0parva. We identified nine malaria box compounds and eight pathogen box compounds that inhibited the proliferation of F100TpM, a T.\u00a0parva infected lymphocyte cell line. However, only two compounds, MMV008212 and MMV688372 represent promising leads with IC50 values of 0.78 and 0.61\u202f\u03bcM, respectively, and CC50 values\u202f>\u202f5\u202f\u03bcM. The remaining compounds exhibited a high degree of toxicity (CC50 values\u202f<\u202f1.09\u202f\u03bcM) on the proliferation of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with concanavalin A. We also tested the anti-cancer drug, dasatinib, used in the chemotherapy of some leukemias. Dasatinib was as active and safe as buparvaquone in\u00a0vitro, with an IC50 of 5 and 4.2\u202fnM, respectively, and CC50\u202f>\u202f10\u202f\u03bcM. Our preliminary data suggest that it may be possible to repurpose compounds from the cancer field as well as MMV as novel anti-T.\u00a0parva molecules.", "\n               In vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the China-Myanmar border area to artemisinins and correlation with K13 mutations ": "Mutations in the Kelch domain of the K13 gene (PF3D7_1343700) were previously associated with artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. This study followed the dynamics of the K13 polymorphisms in P. falciparum parasites from the China-Myanmar border area obtained in 2007\u20132016, and their in vitro sensitivities to artesunate (AS) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA). The 50% effective concentration (EC50\n                     72h) values of 133 culture-adapted field isolates to AS and DHA, measured by the conventional 72\u202fh SYBR Green I-based assay, varied significantly among the parasites from different years; all were significantly higher than that of the reference strain 3D7. Compared with parasites from 2007 to 2008, ring survival rates almost doubled in parasites obtained in later years. Sequencing the full-length K13 genes identified 11 point mutations present in 85 (63.9%) parasite isolates. F446I was the predominant (55/133) variant, and its frequency was increased from 17.6% (3/17) in 2007 to 55.9% (19/34) in 2014\u20132016. No wild-type (WT) Kelch domain sequences were found in the 34 samples obtained from 2014 to 2016. In the 2014\u20132016 samples, a new mutation (G533S) appeared and reached 44.1% (15/34). Collectively, parasites with the Kelch domain mutations (after amino acid 440) had significantly higher ring survival rates than the WT parasites. Individually, F446I, G533S and A676D showed significantly higher ring survival rates than the WT. Although the drug sensitivity phenotypes measured by the RSA6h and EC50\n                     72h assays may be intrinsically linked to the in vivo clinical efficacy data, the values determined by these two assays were not significantly correlated. This study identified the trend of K13 mutations in parasite populations from the China-Myanmar border area, confirmed an overall correlation of Kelch domain mutations with elevated ring-stage survival rates, and emphasized the importance of monitoring the evolution and spread of parasites with reduced artemisinin sensitivity along the malaria elimination course.", "Bumped kinase inhibitor 1369 is effective against Cystoisospora suis in vivo and in vitro\n             ": "Cystoisosporosis is a leading diarrheal disease in suckling piglets. With the confirmation of resistance against the only available drug toltrazuril, there is a substantial need for novel therapeutics to combat the infection and its negative effects on animal health. In closely related apicomplexan species, bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) targeting calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) were shown to be effective in inhibiting host-cell invasion and parasite growth. Therefore, the gene coding for Cystoisospora suis CDPK1 (CsCDPK1) was identified and cloned to investigate activity and thermal stabilization of the recombinant CsCDPK1 enzyme by BKI 1369. In this comprehensive study, the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BKI 1369 in piglets experimentally infected with Cystoisospora suis (toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and toltrazuril-resistant, Holland-I strains) were determined in vivo and in vitro using an established animal infection model and cell culture, respectively. BKI 1369 inhibited merozoite proliferation in intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) by at least 50% at a concentration of 40\u202fnM, and proliferation was almost completely inhibited (>95%) at 200\u202fnM. Nonetheless, exposure of infected cultures to 200\u202fnM BKI 1369 for five days did not induce structural alterations in surviving merozoites as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Five-day treatment with BKI 1369 (10\u202fmg/kg BW twice a day) effectively suppressed oocyst excretion and diarrhea and improved body weight gains in treated piglets without obvious side effects for both toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and resistant, Holland-I C. suis strains. The plasma concentration of BKI 1369 in piglets increased to 11.7\u202f\u03bcM during treatment, suggesting constant drug accumulation and exposure of parasites to the drug. Therefore, oral applications of BKI 1369 could potentially be a therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis. For use in pigs, future studies on BKI 1369 should be directed towards ease of drug handling and minimizing treatment frequencies.", "Insights into Chagas treatment based on the potential of bacteriocin AS-48 ": "Chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi represents a significant public health problem in Latin America, affecting around 8 million cases worldwide. Nowadays is urgent the identification of new antichagasic agents as the only therapeutic options available, Nifurtimox and Benznidazole, are in use for >40 years, and present high toxicity, limited efficacy and frequent treatment failures in the chronic phase of the disease. Recently, it has been described the antiparasitic effect of AS-48, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecalis, against Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp. In this work, we have demonstrated the in vitro potential of the AS-48 bacteriocin against T. cruzi. Interesting, AS-48 was more effective against the three morphological forms of different T. cruzi strains, and displayed lower cytotoxicity than the reference drug Benznidazole. In addition, AS-48 combines the criteria established as a potential antichagasic agent, resulting in a promising therapeutic alternative. According to the action mechanism, AS-48 trypanocidal activity could be explained in a mitochondrion-dependent manner through a reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial depolarization, causing a fast and severe bioenergetic collapse.", "Light pollution in USA and Europe: The good, the bad and the ugly ": "Light pollution is a worldwide problem that has a range of adverse effects on human health and natural ecosystems. Using data from the New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness, VIIRS-recorded radiance and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, we compared light pollution levels, and the light flux to the population size and GDP at the State and County levels in the USA and at Regional (NUTS2) and Province (NUTS3) levels in Europe. We found 6800-fold differences between the most and least polluted regions in Europe, 120-fold differences in their light flux per capita, and 267-fold differences in flux per GDP unit. Yet, we found even greater differences between US counties: 200,000-fold differences in sky pollution, 16,000-fold differences in light flux per capita, and 40,000-fold differences in light flux per GDP unit. These findings may inform policy-makers, helping to reduce energy waste and adverse environmental, cultural and health consequences associated with light pollution.", "Removal of heavy metal ions from wastewaters: A review ": "Heavy metal pollution has become one of the most serious environmental problems today. The treatment of heavy metals is of special concern due to their recalcitrance and persistence in the environment. In recent years, various methods for heavy metal removal from wastewater have been extensively studied. This paper reviews the current methods that have been used to treat heavy metal wastewater and evaluates these techniques. These technologies include chemical precipitation, ion-exchange, adsorption, membrane filtration, coagulation\u2013flocculation, flotation and electrochemical methods. About 185 published studies (1988\u20132010) are reviewed in this paper. It is evident from the literature survey articles that ion-exchange, adsorption and membrane filtration are the most frequently studied for the treatment of heavy metal wastewater.", "Agro-ecological options for fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith) management: Providing low-cost, smallholder friendly solutions to an invasive pest ": "Fall armyworm (FAW), a voracious agricultural pest native to North and South America, was first detected on the African continent in 2016 and has subsequently spread throughout the continent and across Asia. It has been predicted that FAW could cause up to $US13 billion per annum in crop losses throughout sub-Saharan Africa, thereby threatening the livelihoods of millions of poor farmers. In their haste to respond to FAW governments may promote indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides which, aside from human health and environmental risks, could undermine smallholder pest management strategies that depend to a large degree on natural enemies. Agro-ecological approaches offer culturally appropriate low-cost pest control strategies that can be readily integrated into existing efforts to improve smallholder incomes and resilience through sustainable intensification. Such approaches should therefore be promoted as a core component of integrated pest management (IPM) programmes for FAW in combination with crop breeding for pest resistance, classical biological control and selective use of safe pesticides. Nonetheless, the suitability of agro-ecological measures for reducing FAW densities and impact need to be carefully assessed across varied environmental and socio-economic conditions before they can be proposed for wide-scale implementation. To support this process, we review evidence for the efficacy of potential agro-ecological measures for controlling FAW and other pests, consider the associated risks, and draw attention to critical knowledge gaps. The evidence indicates that several measures can be adopted immediately. These include (i) sustainable soil fertility management, especially measures that maintain or restore soil organic carbon; (ii) intercropping with appropriately selected companion plants; and (iii) diversifying the farm environment through management of (semi)natural habitats at multiple spatial scales. Nevertheless, we recommend embedding trials into upscaling programmes so that the costs and benefits of these interventions may be determined across the diverse biophysical and socio-economic contexts that are found in the invaded range.", "Second life batteries lifespan: Rest of useful life and environmental analysis ": "Road transportation is heading towards electrification using Li-ion batteries to power electric vehicles offering eight or ten years' warrant. After that, batteries are considered inappropriate for traction services but they still have 80% of its original capacity. On the other hand, energy storage devices will have an important role in the electricity market. Being Li-ion batteries still too expensive to provide such services with economic profit, the idea to reuse affordable electric vehicle batteries for a 2nd life originated the Sunbatt project, connecting the automotive and electricity sectors. The battery reuse is, by itself, a path towards sustainability, but the cleanliness of energy storage also depends on the electricity generation power sources and the battery ageing or lifespan. This paper analyses the rest of useful life of 2nd life batteries on four different stationary applications, which are: Support to fast electric vehicle charges, self-consumption, area regulation and transmission deferral. To do so, it takes advantage of an equivalent electric battery-ageing model that simulates the battery capacity fade through its use. This model runs on Matlab and includes several ageing mechanisms, such as calendar ageing, C-rate, Depth-of-Discharge, temperature and voltage. Results show that 2nd life battery lifespan clearly depends on its use, going from about 30 years in fast electric vehicle charge support applications to around 6 years in area regulation grid services. Additionally, this study analyses the day-to-day emissions from electricity generation in Spain, and states that grid oriented energy storage applications will hardly offer environmental benefits in the nearby future. On the other hand, applications that go by the hand of renewable power sources, such as self-consumption applications, are much more appropriate.", "Who's in and why? A typology of stakeholder analysis methods for natural resource management ": "Stakeholder analysis means many things to different people. Various methods and approaches have been developed in different fields for different purposes, leading to confusion over the concept and practice of stakeholder analysis. This paper asks how and why stakeholder analysis should be conducted for participatory natural resource management research. This is achieved by reviewing the development of stakeholder analysis in business management, development and natural resource management. The normative and instrumental theoretical basis for stakeholder analysis is discussed, and a stakeholder analysis typology is proposed. This consists of methods for: i) identifying stakeholders; ii) differentiating between and categorising stakeholders; and iii) investigating relationships between stakeholders. The range of methods that can be used to carry out each type of analysis is reviewed. These methods and approaches are then illustrated through a series of case studies funded through the Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme. These case studies show the wide range of participatory and non-participatory methods that can be used, and discuss some of the challenges and limitations of existing methods for stakeholder analysis. The case studies also propose new tools and combinations of methods that can more effectively identify and categorise stakeholders and help understand their inter-relationships.", "Effect of increased wood harvesting and utilization on required greenhouse gas displacement factors of wood-based products and fuels ": "A displacement factor (DF) may be used to describe the efficiency of using wood-based products or fuels instead of fossil-based ones to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the DFs of individual products and their production volumes could not be used alone to evaluate the climate impacts of forest utilization. For this reason, in this study we have developed a methodology to assess a required displacement factor (RDF) for all wood products and bioenergy manufactured and harvested in a certain country in order to achieve zero CO2 equivalent emissions from increased forest utilization over time in comparison with a selected baseline harvesting scenario. Input data for calculations were produced with the simulation model, Monsu, capable of predicting the carbon stocks of forests and wood-based products. We tested the calculations in Finnish conditions in a 100-year time horizon and estimated the current average DF of manufactured wood-based products and fuels in Finland for the interpretation of RDF results. The results showed that if domestic wood harvesting will be increased by 17\u201333% compared to the basic scenario, the RDF will be 2.0 to 2.4 tC tC\u22121 for increased wood use in 2017\u20132116. However, the estimated average DF of manufactured wood-based products and fuels currently in Finland was less than 1.1 tC tC\u22121. The results indicate strongly that the increased harvesting intensity from the current situation would represent a challenge for the Finnish forest-based bioeconomy from the viewpoint of climate change mitigation. For this reason, there is an immediate need to improve reliability and applicability of the RDF approach by repeating corresponding calculations in different circumstances and by improving estimations of DFs on country levels.", "The future of resilience-based management in coral reef ecosystems ": "Resilience underpins the sustainability of both ecological and social systems. Extensive loss of reef corals following recent mass bleaching events have challenged the notion that support of system resilience is a viable reef management strategy. While resilience-based management (RBM) cannot prevent the damaging effects of major disturbances, such as mass bleaching events, it can support natural processes that promote resistance and recovery. Here, we review the potential of RBM to help sustain coral reefs in the 21st century. We explore the scope for supporting resilience through existing management approaches and emerging technologies and discuss their opportunities and limitations in a changing climate. We argue that for RBM to be effective in a changing world, reef management strategies need to involve both existing and new interventions that together reduce stress, support the fitness of populations and species, and help people and economies to adapt to a highly altered ecosystem.", "Toilet revolution in China ": "The wide-spread prevalence of unimproved sanitation technologies has been a major cause of concern for the environment and public health, and China is no exception to this. Towards the sanitation issue, toilet revolution has become a buzzword in China recently. This paper elaborates the backgrounds, connotations, and actions of the toilet revolution in China. The toilet revolution aims to create sanitation infrastructure and public services that work for everyone and that turn waste into value. Opportunities for implementing the toilet revolution include: fulfilling Millennium Development Goals and new Sustainable Development Goals; government support at all levels for popularizing sanitary toilet; environmental protection to alleviate wastewater pollution; resource recovery from human waste and disease prevention for health and wellbeing improvement. Meanwhile, the challenges faced are: insufficient funding and policy support, regional imbalance and lagging approval processes, weak sanitary awareness and low acceptance of new toilets, lack of R&D and service system. The toilet revolution requires a concerted effort from many governmental departments. It needs to address not only technology implementation, but also social acceptance, economic affordability, maintenance issues and, increasingly, gender considerations. Aligned with the ecological sanitation principles, it calls for understanding issues across the entire sanitation service chain. Public-private partnership is also recommended to absorb private capital to make up the lack of funds, as well as arouse the enthusiasm of the public.", "Volatile fatty acids production from food wastes for biorefinery platforms: A review ": "Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are a class of largely used compounds in the chemical industry, serving as starting molecules for bioenergy production and for the synthesis of a variety of products, such as biopolymers, reduced chemicals and derivatives. Because of the huge amounts of food waste generated from household and processing industry, 47 and 17 million tons per year respectively only in the EU-28 Countries, food wastes can be the right candidate for volatile fatty acids production. This review investigates all the major topics involved in the optimization of VFAs production from food wastes. Regarding the best operative conditions for the anaerobic fermenter controlled pH in the neutral range (6.0\u20137.0), short HRT (lower than 10 days), thermophilic temperatures and an organic loading rate of about 10 kgVS/m3d, allowed for an increase in the VFAs concentration between 10 and 25%. It was also found that additions of mineral acids, from 0.5 to 3.0%, and thermal pretreatment in the range 140\u2013170\u202f\u00b0C increase the organic matter solubilisation. Applications of VFAs considered in this study were biofuels and bioplastics production as well as nutrients removal in biological wastewater treatment processes.", "Novel treatment technologies for PFAS compounds: A critical review ": "Perfluorinated compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have recently drawn great attention due to their wide distribution in aquatic environments. The understanding of the physicochemical properties and fate and transport of PFAs in groundwater is still limited. Preliminary studies indicate that these compounds can readily bioaccumulate and pose human and animal health concerns. Due to their physicochemical properties, PFOS and PFOA are water soluble, nonvolatile and persistent in the environment, which is a cause of concern related to their treatment with conventional remediation technologies. Extraction with inefficient carbon adsorption is one of the most common treatment technologies for remediation of PFOS- or PFOA-impacted groundwater. Several other innovative and promising technologies, including sonochemistry, bioremediation and photolysis, have been tested for their effectiveness in removal of perfluorinated compounds. This paper provides a baseline for understanding research needs to better develop treatment technologies for PFOA and PFOS in groundwater. Frontiers for improving the state of practice for PFOA and PFOS treatment include the development of more cost-effective ex situ treatment methods and the development and demonstration of promising in situ treatment technologies at the pilot and full scale.", "Coral reefs for coastal protection: A new methodological approach and engineering case study in Grenada ": "Coastal communities in tropical environments are at increasing risk from both environmental degradation and climate change and require urgent local adaptation action. Evidences show coral reefs play a critical role in wave attenuation but relatively little direct connection has been drawn between these effects and impacts on shorelines. Reefs are rarely assessed for their coastal protection service and thus not managed for their infrastructure benefits, while widespread damage and degradation continues. This paper presents a systematic approach to assess the protective role of coral reefs and to examine solutions based on the reef's influence on wave propagation patterns. Portions of the shoreline of Grenville Bay, Grenada, have seen acute shoreline erosion and coastal flooding. This paper (i) analyzes the historical changes in the shoreline and the local marine, (ii) assess the role of coral reefs in shoreline positioning through a shoreline equilibrium model first applied to coral reef environments, and (iii) design and begin implementation of a reef-based solution to reduce erosion and flooding. Coastline changes in the bay over the past 6 decades are analyzed from bathymetry and benthic surveys, historical imagery, historical wave and sea level data and modeling of wave dynamics. The analysis shows that, at present, the healthy and well-developed coral reefs system in the southern bay keeps the shoreline in equilibrium and stable, whereas reef degradation in the northern bay is linked with severe coastal erosion. A comparison of wave energy modeling for past bathymetry indicates that degradation of the coral reefs better explains erosion than changes in climate and historical sea level rise. Using this knowledge on how reefs affect the hydrodynamics, a reef restoration solution is designed and studied to ameliorate the coastal erosion and flooding. A characteristic design provides a modular design that can meet specific engineering, ecological and implementation criteria. Four pilot units were implemented in 2015 and are currently being field-tested. This paper presents one of the few existing examples available to date of a reef restoration project designed and engineered to deliver risk reduction benefits. The case study shows how engineering and ecology can work together in community-based adaptation. Our findings are particularly important for Small Island States on the front lines of climate change, who have the most to gain from protecting and managing coral reefs as coastal infrastructure.", "A review on thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of plastic solid waste (PSW) ": "Plastic plays an important role in our daily lives due to its versatility, light weight and low production cost. Plastics became essential in many sectors such as construction, medical, engineering applications, automotive, aerospace, etc. In addition, economic growth and development also increased our demand and dependency on plastics which leads to its accumulation in landfills imposing risk on human health, animals and cause environmental pollution problems such as ground water contamination, sanitary related issues, etc. Hence, a sustainable and an efficient plastic waste treatment is essential to avoid such issues. Pyrolysis is a thermo-chemical plastic waste treatment technique which can solve such pollution problems, as well as, recover valuable energy and products such as oil and gas. Pyrolysis of plastic solid waste (PSW) has gained importance due to having better advantages towards environmental pollution and reduction of carbon footprint of plastic products by minimizing the emissions of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide compared to combustion and gasification. This paper presents the existing techniques of pyrolysis, the parameters which affect the products yield and selectivity and identify major research gaps in this technology. The influence of different catalysts on the process as well as review and comparative assessment of pyrolysis with other thermal and catalytic plastic treatment methods, is also presented.", "Sustainable construction\u2014The role of environmental assessment tools ": "Construction has been accused of causing environmental problems ranging from excessive consumption of global resources both in terms of construction and building operation to the pollution of the surrounding environment, and research on green building design and using building materials to minimise environmental impact is already underway. However, relying on the design of a project to achieve the goal of sustainable development, or to minimise impacts through appropriate management on site, is not sufficient to handle the current problem. The aim for sustainability assessment goes even further than at the design stage of a project to consider its importance at an early stage, before any detailed design or even before a commitment is made to go ahead with a development. However, little or no concern has been given to the importance of selecting more environmentally friendly designs during the project appraisal stage; the stage when environmental matters are best incorporated. The main objectives of this paper are to examine the development, role and limitations of current environmental building assessment methods in ascertaining building sustainability used in different countries which leads to discuss the concept of developing a. sustainability model for project appraisal based on a multi-dimensional approach, that will allow alternatives to be ranked is discussed in detail in the paper.", "Five principles for the practice of knowledge exchange in environmental management ": "This paper outlines five principles for effective practice of knowledge exchange, which when applied, have the potential to significantly enhance the impact of environmental management research, policy and practice. The paper is based on an empirical analysis of interviews with 32 researchers and stakeholders across 13 environmental management research projects, each of which included elements of knowledge co-creation and sharing in their design. The projects focused on a range of upland and catchment management issues across the UK, and included Research Council, Government and NGO funded projects. Preliminary findings were discussed with knowledge exchange professionals and academic experts to ensure the emerging principles were as broadly applicable as possible across multiple disciplines. The principles suggest that: knowledge exchange needs to be designed into research; the needs of likely research users and other stakeholders should be systematically represented in the research where possible; and long-term relationships must be built on trust and two-way dialogue between researchers and stakeholders in order to ensure effective co-generation of new knowledge. We found that the delivery of tangible benefits early on in the research process helps to ensure continued motivation and engagement of likely research users. Knowledge exchange is a flexible process that must be monitored, reflected on and continuously refined, and where possible, steps should be taken to ensure a legacy of ongoing knowledge exchange beyond initial research funding. The principles have been used to inform the design of knowledge exchange and stakeholder engagement guidelines for two international research programmes. They are able to assist researchers, decision-makers and other stakeholders working in contrasting environmental management settings to work together to co-produce new knowledge, and more effectively share and apply existing knowledge to manage environmental change.", "Possible applications of coal fly ash in wastewater treatment ": "Management of coal fly ash as a particulate byproduct of coal burning has become an issue to be solved right away due to environmental concerns related to soil, water, and air pollution. Many attempts have been made by researchers for the conversion of coal fly ash into useful products while searching feasible avenues for its sustainable utilization. Wastewater remediation using coal fly ash is one such attempt solving both waste management and water quality issues. The characteristics like morphology, surface area, porosity, and chemical composition (silica, alumina, iron oxide, titania, etc.) make coal fly ash amenable material for potential application in wastewater treatment. Few reports have summarized the coal fly ash utilization in wastewater treatment but solely discussed the adsorption. Besides adsorption, the current paper aims to highlight the possibilities of using coal fly ash in wastewater treatment by different technologies that extend the utilization scope in the domains of filtration, Fenton process, photocatalysis, and coagulation. The promising use of coal fly ash as an adsorbent, membrane filter, Fenton catalyst, photocatalyst, and as an integral part of these structures is reviewed. Finally, the current trends and future prospects on utilization modes of coal fly ash in wastewater treatment are stated.", "Methods to reliably estimate faecal sludge quantities and qualities for the design of treatment technologies and management solutions ": "Sanitation access in urban areas of low-income countries is provided through unstandardized onsite technologies containing accumulated faecal sludge. The demand for infrastructure to manage faecal sludge is increasing, however, no reliable method exists to estimate total accumulated quantities and qualities (Q&Q) This proposed approach averages out complexities to estimate conditions at a centralized to semi-centralized scale required for management and treatment technology solutions, as opposed to previous approaches evaluating what happens in individual containments. Empirical data, demographic data, and questionnaires were used in Kampala, Uganda to estimate total faecal sludge accumulation in the city, resulting in 270\u202fL/cap\u2219year for pit latrines and 280\u202fL/cap\u2219year for septic tanks. Septic tank sludge was more dilute than pit latrine sludge, however, public toilet was not a distinguishing factor. Non-household sources of sludge represent a significant fraction of the total and have different characteristics than household-level sludge. Income level, water connection, black water only, solid waste, number of users, containment volume, emptying frequency, and truck size were predictors of sludge quality. Empirical relationships such as a COD:TS of 1.09\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.56 could be used for more resource efficient sampling campaigns. Based on this approach, spatially available demographic, technical and environmental (SPA-DET) data and statistical relationships between parameters could be used to predict Q&Q of faecal sludge.", "Conversion of food and kitchen waste to value-added products ": "Food and kitchen waste - omnipresent in every corner of the world serve as an excellent source of value added products owing to high organic content. Regardless of existence of various traditional methods of land filling or biogas production used to harness food waste energy, effective conversion of food to valuable resources is often challenged by its heterogenous nature and high moisture content. The current paper tries to lay down the prospects and consequences associated with food waste management. The various social, economical and environmental concerns associated with food waste management especially in terms of green house gas emission and extended rate of leachate generation also has been discussed. The difficulties in proper collection, storage and bioconversion of food waste to valuable by-products are pointed as a big hurdle in proper waste management. Finally, the wide array of value added products developed from food waste after pretreatment are also enlisted to emphasis the prospects of food waste management.", "A critical review on textile wastewater treatments: Possible approaches ": "Waste water is a major environmental impediment for the growth of the textile industry besides the other minor issues like solid waste and resource waste management. Textile industry uses many kinds of synthetic dyes and discharge large amounts of highly colored wastewater as the uptake of these dyes by fabrics is very poor. This highly colored textile wastewater severely affects photosynthetic function in plant. It also has an impact on aquatic life due to low light penetration and oxygen consumption. It may also be lethal to certain forms of marine life due to the occurrence of component metals and chlorine present in the synthetic dyes. So, this textile wastewater must be treated before their discharge. In this article, different treatment methods to treat the textile wastewater have been presented along with cost per unit volume of treated water. Treatment methods discussed in this paper involve oxidation methods (cavitation, photocatalytic oxidation, ozone, H2O2, fentons process), physical methods (adsorption and filtration), biological methods (fungi, algae, bacteria, microbial fuel cell). This review article will also recommend the possible remedial measures to treat different types of effluent generated from each textile operation.", "The urban heat island effect, its causes, and mitigation, with reference to the thermal properties of asphalt concrete ": "The Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a phenomenon that affects many millions of people worldwide. The higher temperatures experienced in urban areas compared to the surrounding countryside has enormous consequences for the health and wellbeing of people living in cities. The increased use of manmade materials and increased anthropogenic heat production are the main causes of the UHI. This has led to the understanding that increased urbanisation is the primary cause of the urban heat island. The UHI effect also leads to increased energy needs that further contribute to the heating of our urban landscape, and the associated environmental and public health consequences. Pavements and roofs dominate the urban surface exposed to solar irradiation. This review article outlines the contribution that pavements make to the UHI effect and analyses localized and citywide mitigation strategies against the UHI. Asphalt Concrete (AC) is one of the most common pavement surfacing materials and is a significant contributor to the UHI. Densely graded AC has low albedo and high volumetric heat capacity, which results in surface temperatures reaching upwards of 60\u00a0\u00b0C on hot summer days. Cooling the surface of a pavement by utilizing cool pavements has been a consistent theme in recent literature. Cool pavements can be reflective or evaporative. However, the urban geometry and local atmospheric conditions should dictate whether or not these mitigation strategies should be used. Otherwise both of these pavements can actually increase the UHI effect. Increasing the prevalence of green spaces through the installation of street trees, city parks and rooftop gardens has consistently demonstrated a reduction in the UHI effect. Green spaces also increase the cooling effect derived from water and wind sources. This literature review demonstrates that UHI mitigation techniques are best used in combination with each other. As a result of the study, it was concluded that the current mitigation measures need development to make them relevant to various climates and throughout the year. There are also many possible sources of future study, and alternative measures for mitigation have been described, thereby providing scope for future research and development following this review.", "Pig manure treatment and purification by filtration ": "This study aimed to develop a new, complex pig manure treatment and filtration process. The final scheme, called the AMAK process, comprised the following successive steps: mineralization with mineral acids, alkalization with lime milk, superphosphate addition, a second alkalization, thermal treatment, and pressure filtration. The proposed method produced a filtrate with 95%, 80%, and 96% reductions in chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen content, and phosphorus content, respectively. An advantage of the proposed method was that it incorporated a crystalline phase into the solid organic part of the manure, which enabled high filtration rates (>1000\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121) and efficient separation. The process also eliminated odor emissions from the filtrate and sediment. The treated filtrate could be used to irrigate crops or it could be further treated in conventional biological wastewater treatment plants. The sediment could be used for producing mineral-organic fertilizer. The AMAK process is inexpensive, and it requires low investment costs.", "Assessment of heavy metal pollution from anthropogenic activities and remediation strategies: A review ": "Heavy metal pollution is a nefarious issue with implications for life. Heavy metals are natural occurring elements, having both natural and anthropogenic sources. The latter are however the most significant, releasing greater amounts of these pollutants in more toxic and mobile forms. Their chemistry and dynamics in the ecosystems are presented, and the relation to the pollution problematic thereof is discussed. The concentration of heavy metals in several sites, assessed in water, soil and sediment samples, affected by different pollution sources are reviewed. These evidence how human activities impact natural media and how the pollution spreads. The pollution in each media is assessed by the concentration relative to drinking and irrigation water guidelines, and by the geoaccumulation index of soils and sediments. It is found that ore extraction and processing and metallurgical industries stand atop the most polluting sources. Given the dynamics of heavy metal cations and that, most of these are released in liquid effluents, wastewater treatment techniques for the removal of heavy metals are also surveyed and critically discussed. Economic viability at a large municipal scale and the ability to comply with strict regulations are the determining factors in the selection of these techniques. A critical discussion on the viability of such techniques is made, reviewing some literature studies and commenting on their applicability on the previously found polluted media.", "Recent developments in Life Cycle Assessment ": "Life Cycle Assessment is a tool to assess the environmental impacts and resources used throughout a product's life cycle, i.e., from raw material acquisition, via production and use phases, to waste management. The methodological development in LCA has been strong, and LCA is broadly applied in practice. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of recent developments of LCA methods. The focus is on some areas where there has been an intense methodological development during the last years. We also highlight some of the emerging issues. In relation to the Goal and Scope definition we especially discuss the distinction between attributional and consequential LCA. For the Inventory Analysis, this distinction is relevant when discussing system boundaries, data collection, and allocation. Also highlighted are developments concerning databases and Input\u2013Output and hybrid LCA. In the sections on Life Cycle Impact Assessment we discuss the characteristics of the modelling as well as some recent developments for specific impact categories and weighting. In relation to the Interpretation the focus is on uncertainty analysis. Finally, we discuss recent developments in relation to some of the strengths and weaknesses of LCA.", "Removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from wastewater: A review ": "The pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging pollutants which might pose potential hazards to environment and health. These pollutants are becoming ubiquitous in the environments because they cannot be effectively removed by the conventional wastewater treatment plants due to their toxic and recalcitrant performance. The presence of PPCPs has received increasing attention in recent years, resulting in great concern on their occurrence, transformation, fate and risk in the environments. A variety of technologies, including physical, biological and chemical processes have been extensively investigated for the removal of PPCPs from wastewater. In this paper, the classes, functions and the representatives of the frequently detected PPCPs in aquatic environments were summarized. The analytic methods for PPCPs were briefly introduced. The removal efficiency of PPCPs by wastewater treatment plants was analyzed and discussed. The removal of PPCPs from wastewater by physical, chemical and biological processes was analyzed, compared and summarized. Finally, suggestions are made for future study of PPCPs. This review can provide an overview for the removal of PPCPs from wastewater.", "Remote sensing and GIS applications for municipal waste management ": "The production of municipal solid waste has increased noticeably during the recent past due to the mounting global population and fast urbanization. Furthermore, its poor management and inappropriate disposal are a global challenge since these have created environmental problems in urban ecosystems. Waste management problems are significantly stalled because of a lack of quality data. This is particularly the case in developing countries where observation infrastructure is weak. Regional waste management strategies involve distributed data, while typical small-scale studies present just point information and in the lack of vital widespread information, the regional studies can't provide dependable results. With the materialization of new techniques such as remote sensing and GIS, regional waste management studies have become easier during the last few decades. Use of these techniques in solid waste management supports in capturing, handling, and transmitting the required information in a prompt and proper manner. These techniques are also useful in acquiring information directly from the remote site at a fairly low cost. This paper provides an overview of remote sensing and GIS techniques used for managing the environmental problems of waste disposal. An indication of the waste disposal problems and its management alongside the ramifications of the analysis is discussed. The background and rationale of the waste disposal problems are detailed. The applications of remote sensing and GIS in waste management modeling are presented and applications of these techniques in diverse case studies worldwide are described. The study revealed that the efficiency of waste management system can be maximized by the proper use of remote sensing and GIS techniques. The study also revealed that these techniques were most commonly used for siting the landfill and waste bin for waste disposal and evaluation of environmental impact of buried waste.", "Environmental sustainability of anaerobic digestion of household food waste ": "Consumers are the leading producers of food waste (FW) in developed countries and the majority of household FW is still embedded in general waste where it is incinerated or landfilled. There is increasing awareness in the value of collecting FW as a separate waste stream for production of compost or recovery of energy through anaerobic digestion (AD). This study focuses on AD to evaluate the life cycle environmental sustainability of recovering energy and fertilisers from household FW in the UK. The analysis is carried out for two different functional units: i) treatment of 1 tonne of FW, which is compared to incineration and landfilling; and ii) generation of 1\u202fMWh of electricity, which is compared to other electricity generation options. The former results in net negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (\u221239\u202fkg CO2-eq./t) and primary energy demand (\u22122\u202fGJ/t) due to the displacement of grid electricity and mineral fertilisers. AD has lower impacts than both incineration and landfilling across 15 of the 19 impacts. However, the application of digestate to land and the release of ammonia and nitrates lead to higher marine eutrophication (ME), terrestrial acidification (TA) and particulate matter formation (PMF). For the second functional unit, AD electricity emits 203\u202fkg CO2-eq./MWh, compared to 357\u202fkg CO2-eq./MWh for the UK grid mix. Compared to renewables, such as wind and solar, AD electricity has lower energy demand, toxicity potentials and metal depletion. However, it has higher global warming potential, ME, TA and PMF. At the UK level, treating 4.9\u202fMt of kerbside FW collected annually could provide 0.37% of the national electricity demand and save 190,000\u202ft CO2-eq./yr compared to the grid electricity. The digestate produced could displace 1% of industrial nitrogen fertilisers. Although small fractions of the national demands, they represent a valuable return from a largely unutilised waste stream and help towards implementation of a circular economy.", "Restoring the Florida Everglades Comments on the current reservoir plan for solving harmful algal blooms and restoring the Florida Everglades": "Preface\n               \n                  This is an updated version of a review written by the author in April 2018 at the request of The Friends of the Everglades, an NGO based in Miami, Florida, on a plan developed primarily by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) to mitigate coastal pollution that has resulted from discharges from Lake Okeechobee to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastline and eventually to \u201csend the water south\u201d to the Florida Everglades instead. This EAA Reservoir project was included by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a 2018 U.S. Congressional bill that was approved. In May 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to spend $200 million to begin construction of this restoration, three times the amount requested by the state of Florida. While supported with enthusiasm by the Florida state legislature, the SFWMD, and some NGOs such as The Everglades Foundation, a change in leadership in the state of Florida after November 2018 elections and especially in the leadership of the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) has led to a renewed public optimism for major improvements in water quality management in south Florida. It is therefore timely for this review of the advantages and shortcomings of this \u201cEAA (Everglades Agricultural Area) Reservoir Plan\u201d to be widely disseminated in an international forum such as Ecological Engineering to encourage discussions among scientists and engineers.", "Tree species selection and reaction to mine soil reconstructed at reforested post-mine sites: Central and eastern European experiences ": "Post-mining landscapes are examples of large-scale disturbances to ecosystems, and reclamation is of worldwide interest and concern. In central and eastern Europe, coal still plays a key role in the energy mix. In particular, open strip mining strongly influences the disturbance to the Earth's surface and hydrological conditions. Large portions of post-mining sites are reforested because forest restoration establishes the existence of an ecosystem that is sustainable over the long term, which ensures landscape and environmental profits. The success of reforestation depends on the adaptations of the tree species to the newly formed reclaimed mine soils, which are characterised by highly changeable chemical and physical soil properties with significant spatial variability in terms of habitat conditions. Thus, in recent years, interest in tree species selection and adaptation to post-mining sites has grown. This review presents information on the consequences of mining extraction and reclamation management with a special focus on the diversity of mine soil substrates. Examples of soil reconstruction techniques, variation in mine soils and reclaimed sites undergoing reforestation and forest management are discussed based on the usefulness of the tree species commonly used for reclamation in central and eastern Europe, such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), European oak (Quercus robus L.) and alders (Alnus ssp.). The species response to mine sites is discussed in terms of tree growth, morphology, biomass, root system reaction and macronutrient supply. The general recommendation is that the introduced reforestation methods should be closely related to the desired quality of soil substrates and shares of species from various functional groups. Pioneering, target and phytomelioration species should be selected not only on the basis of their assumed roles but also according to assessments of the response of these species to the habitat conditions at post-mine sites.", "Developing and validating a decision support tool for media selection to mitigate drainage waters ": "The nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-N) and/or dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) load in drainage water from farms can be managed by reactive or biological media filters. The nutrient content of the drainage water can be obtained directly from water analysis, which immediately focuses attention on filter media selection. There are many factors that may be important before choosing a medium or media e.g. nutrient removal capacity, lifetime, hydraulic conductivity, the potential for \u201cpollution swapping\u201d, attenuation of non-target contaminants (e.g. pesticides, organic carbon, etc.), and local availability and transportation cost of media to site. In this study, a novel decision support tool (DST) was developed, which brought all these factors together in one place for five nutrient scenarios. A systematic literature review was conducted to create a database containing 75 media with an associated static scoring system across seven criteria (% of nutrient concentration reduction, removal of other pollutants, lifetime, hydraulic conductivity, negative externalities) and a dynamic scoring system across two criteria (delivery cost and availability). The DST was tested using case studies from Ireland, Belgium and USA with different agricultural practices and nutrient scenarios. It was then validated by SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities and threats) analysis. The DST provided a rapid, easily modifiable screening of many media-based treatments for specific dual or single nutrient-based water drainage problems. This provides stakeholders (farmers/regulators/advisors) with a versatile, flexible and robust yet easy-to-understand framework to make informed choices on appropriate media-based mitigation measures according to users\u2019 relevant technical, economic and logistical factors.", "Effect of organic matter on phosphorus adsorption and desorption in a black soil from Northeast China ": "Phosphorus (P) adsorption\u2013desorption in soil is an important internal cycle related to soil fertility problems, as well as for determining the environmental fate of P. Soil organic matter (SOM) has been identified as an important factor affecting the adsorption\u2013desorption of soil P through different mechanisms. In this study, humic acids were added to change the SOM content in black soil. Following an incubation period of 30 days, the changes in soil P adsorption\u2013desorption capacity were studied. The results indicated that increased SOM led to increases in the soil available P and the P activation coefficient. All soil treatments fitted well with both Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The P adsorption and desorption characteristics were analyzed using the Langmuir equation as a local isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity of P increased with the increase in SOM, but the P bonding energy and maximum buffering capacity first decreased, and then increased, with the lowest values obtained with a SOM content of 75.3 mg kg\u22121. Both the maximum desorption capacity of P and the ratio of soil P desorption showed a fluctuating trend, which were the greatest when the SOM content reached 75.3 g kg\u22121 in black soil, showing an improved ability to release P. Thus, the addition of organic matter could efficiently enhance P availability by reducing the strength of P adsorption and the maximum phosphate buffering capacity and increasing the desorption of P to some extent, with the greatest P availability obtained at a SOM content of 75.3\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121.", "Historical increase in agricultural machinery weights enhanced soil stress levels and adversely affected soil functioning ": "Soil compaction caused by vehicular traffic adversely affects key soil functions and ecosystem services that soils provide. Although compaction is a well-recognized problem, it remains challenging to quantify the economic and ecological costs of compaction. The mechanization in agriculture has resulted in a steady increase in weight of farm vehicles. It is reasonable to assume that this has exacerbated soil compaction, but there is little quantitative knowledge on the development of compaction levels in arable soils. To quantify these trends, we use historical records of harvester and tractor weights to simulate how the weight increase has changed soil stresses and bulk density of arable soil, and to predict impacts on the mechanical resistance for root growth and on soil hydraulic properties. Our simulations show a clear increase in soil stress levels with higher bulk density and mechanical penetration resistance, and a decrease in soil hydraulic conductivity in agreement with available data. We show that increased mechanical resistance has resulted in decreased root elongation rates and consequently prolonged the time required for roots to reach a certain soil depth. The historical changes of compaction levels and associated limitations on root elongation rates coincide with a stagnation in crop yields in the 1990s observed for cereals in many countries. Our calculations illustrate that the historical increase in compaction levels has drastically decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity and water storage capacity of subsoils. We speculate that this has contributed to the increase in the incidence and severity of flood events during recent decades in Europe. Finally, we take Sweden as an example and estimate annual compaction costs due to agricultural productivity loss and flooding damage of several hundred M\u20ac yr\u22121 for Sweden. Considering the continuation of upwards trends in the average weight of farm machinery and the projected increase in extreme weather events, the costs of soil compaction are likely to escalate. The study highlights that we have likely exceeded the acceptable loads, and that future agricultural operations must consider the inherent mechanical limit of soil.", "Spatial variability of soil properties and cereal yield in a cultivated field on sandy soil ": "Sandy soils are used in agriculture in different regions of the world. In Poland soils derived from sands occupy about 50% of agricultural area. Productivity of the soils depend on the soil properties that vary in the scale of field. This study aimed at determining and mapping the within-field variation of soil physical and chemical properties and grain yield of oats, rye, oats and triticale in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2015, respectively. The experiment was set up in a field (200\u00d750m) on sandy soil in Trzebiesz\u00f3w (region Podlasie, Poland). The soil measurements included sand, silt, clay, and organic carbon (SOC) contents, cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH in the topsoil (0\u201310cm) and subsoil (30\u201340cm) layers in 2001, and water content and bulk density in the topsoil layer in spring and summer 2002\u20132003. The yields of oats were assessed in 2001 and 2003 and those of rye and triticale in 2002 and 2015, respectively. The soil properties and cereal yields were determined at 33\u201355 points in a grid evenly covering the whole field area. The results were analyzed using classic statistics and geostatistics by constructing semivariograms and 2D mapping by Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The cereal grain yields were significantly positively correlated with the topsoil water content (SWC) (r=0.295\u20130.711), clay content (r=0.081\u20130.174), and SOC in the subsoil (r=0.208\u20130.271) and CEC in both layers (r=0.123\u20130.298) and negatively correlated with bulk density (BD) (r=\u20130.065 to \u22120.279). The spatial dependence determined by the \u201cnugget-to-sill\u201d ratio was moderate or weak for the silt and clay content, CEC, and pH (29\u201379%) and strong for SOC, BD, SWC, and crop yield (0.2\u201313.2%). The effective range of the spatial dependence for all studied quantities varied from 9.9 to 120m. The cereal yields were positively and significantly correlated between all study years (r=0.141\u20130.734), which indicates inter-annual similarity in their spatial distribution. The 2D maps based on the IDW allowed assessing how gradual or sharp the changes in the studied quantities from one place to another are. Similar spatial patterns of the SWC, SOC and CEC, and crop yields were observed. This is of importance in precise and sustainable field management aimed at increasing and aligning spatial crop productivity of the studied low-productivity sandy soils that will have to be used in crop production due to the current shortage of land resources and food supplies on a global scale.", "Long-term effects of crop succession, soil tillage and climate on wheat yield and soil properties ": "Climate change is increasing crop losses and yield variability with impacts for global food security. In this context, conservation agriculture appears as a potential solution to maintain crop productivity, soil fertility and environmental sustainability. Therefore, understanding the combined effects of soil tillage and crop succession over a long period is of primary interest. In this study, we analyzed data from a 50\u2009year long-term field experiment to assess (i) the change of climatic parameters, wheat yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) content; (ii) the combined effects of crop succession (monoculture vs. crop rotation) and soil tillage system (minimum tillage vs. plough) on wheat yield, SOC content and other soil properties at three soil depths (0\u201310, 10\u201320 and 20\u201350\u2009cm); and (iii) the relative contributions of climatic parameters, wheat phenology and agricultural practices on wheat yield variability. Wheat yield was 16% higher in crop rotation compared to monoculture, while soil tillage system had no significant effect on wheat yield during the period 1977\u20132016. Despite a SOC content decline over time, which was especially marked during the first ten years of the study, SOC content was 7% higher in the minimum tillage treatment compared to the plough treatment, while crop rotation had no significant effect. In 2016, after 50\u2009years of experimentation, both crop succession and soil tillage systems influenced soil properties. Over the 50-year period, the climatic conditions around the heading phase explained 22% of yield variability, while 18% of this variability was explained by crop succession and 6% by the growing degree days until heading stage. In a context of conservation agriculture promotion, our long-term field experiment provides key evidence that the combination of both minimum soil tillage and crop rotation improves soil fertility and crop productivity.", "Increasing organic stocks in agricultural soils: Knowledge gaps and potential innovations ": "Recent initiatives, such as the United Nations declaring 2015 as the International Year of Soils and the French \u00ab 4 per 1000 \u00bb initiative call attention on soils and on the importance of maintaining and increasing soil organic matter stocks for soil fertility and food security, and for climate change adaptation and mitigation. We stress that soil organic carbon storage (i.e. an increase of soil organic carbon stocks) should be clearly differentiated from soil organic carbon sequestration, as the latter assumes a net removal of atmospheric CO2. Implementing management options that allow increasing soil organic carbon stocks at the local scale raises several questions, which are discussed in this article: how can we increase SOC stocks, at which rate and for how long; where do we prioritize SOC storage; how do we estimate the potential gain in C and which agricultural practices should we implement? We show that knowledge and tools are available to answer many of these questions, while further research remains necessary for others. A range of agricultural practices would require a re-assessment of their potential to store C and a better understanding of the underlying processes, such as no tillage and conservation agriculture, irrigation, practices increasing below ground inputs, organic amendments, and N fertilization. The vision emerging from the literature, showing the prominent role of soil microorganisms in the stabilization of soil organic matter, draw the attention to more exploratory potential levers, through changes in microbial physiology or soil biodiversity induced by agricultural practices, that require in-depth research.", "Developing strategies to recover crop productivity after soil compaction\u2014A plant eco-physiological perspective ": "Soil compaction constitutes a major threat to the fertility of arable soils and food security. The aim of this paper is to highlight the need and opportunities for plant eco-physiological approaches to identify strategies to recover crop yields after soil compaction. Reduced productivity on compacted soil primarily results from decreased root elongation rates and thus limited accessibility to water and nutrients. Hence, strategies to recover productivity after compaction must address plant eco-physiological phenomena that underlie low root system expansion rates. In compacted soil, root growth is decreased due to high soil penetration resistance and due to low oxygen concentration in soil air caused by reduced fluid transport capability. Thus, plant roots are exposed to a multi-stress environment, which needs to be addressed directly when aiming to recover productivity after compaction in the long-term. Here, we discuss possibilities to increase root growth in order to enhance resource accessibility and recover crop productivity on compacted soil. Yield recovery can be achieved through breeding of novel cultivars and targeted soil management approaches. On the one hand, the tolerance of plants to the different soil physical stresses can be enhanced by selecting for specific root traits that facilitate root growth in compacted soil. Soil management approaches that improve specific physical properties of compacted soil on the other hand can facilitate root growth in compacted soil. Since plant roots are major drivers of soil structure dynamics, increasing root growth in compacted soil may not only mitigate crop productivity losses but also recover soil structure.", "A history of research on the link between (micro)aggregates, soil biota, and soil organic matter dynamics ": "Since the 1900s, the link between soil biotic activity, soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and stabilization, and soil aggregate dynamics has been recognized and intensively been studied. By 1950, many studies had, mostly qualitatively, investigated the influence of the five major factors (i.e. soil fauna, microorganisms, roots, inorganics and physical processes) on this link. After 1950, four theoretical mile-stones related to this subject were realized. The first one was when Emerson [Nature 183 (1959) 538] proposed a model of a soil crumb consisting of domains of oriented clay and quartz particles. Next, Edwards and Bremner [J. Soil Sci. 18 (1967) 64] formulated a theory in which the solid-phase reaction between clay minerals, polyvalent cations and SOM is the main process leading to microaggregate formation. Based on this concept, Tisdall and Oades [J. Soil Sci. 62 (1982) 141] coined the aggregate hierarchy concept describing a spatial scale dependence of mechanisms involved in micro- and macroaggregate formation. Oades [Plant Soil 76 (1984) 319] suggested a small, but very important, modification to the aggregate hierarchy concept by theorizing the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates. Recent research on aggregate formation and SOM stabilization extensively corroborate this modification and use it as the base for furthering the understanding of SOM dynamics. The major outcomes of adopting this modification are: (1) microaggregates, rather than macroaggregates protect SOM in the long term; and (2) macroaggregate turnover is a crucial process influencing the stabilization of SOM. Reviewing the progress made over the last 50 years in this area of research reveals that still very few studies are quantitative and/or consider interactive effects between the five factors. The quantification of these relationships is clearly needed to improve our ability to predict changes in soil ecosystems due to management and global change. This quantification can greatly benefit from viewing aggregates as dynamic rather than static entities and relating aggregate measurements with 2D and 3D quantitative spatial information.", "Soil water retention, physiological characteristics, and growth of maize plants in response to biochar application to soil ": "Studies on biochar application in agriculture are broad, but the effects are variable and depend on the type of plant, biochar properties, and application rate, as well as some soil characteristics and environmental conditions. This study aimed to assess the effect of applying different doses of biochar with two particle sizes on the physical and chemical characteristics of a Typic Haplustox, sandy loam, and on the growth and physiological characters of maize plants, under two soil moisture conditions. The study was conducted in a greenhouse, using two biochar particle sizes (2.0\u22120.5 and < 0.5\u2009mm), at six doses (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60\u2009g kg\u22121) and two water conditions (with and without drought stress). The plant characters assessed were height, stem diameter, leaf area, shoot fresh and dry weight, and nutritional status. Leaf relative water content, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance were evaluated under drought stress. The soil attributes studied were density, porosity, water retention curve, and hydrophobicity, in addition to chemical characterization. There were no statistical differences between the two biochar particle sizes, except for bulk density and microporosity. Under adequate water conditions, and two doses of biochar applied to the soil increased photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and leaf relative water content in the sewn corn. In the soil, biochar raised water retention and the micropore/macropore ratio and reduced bulk density, in addition to improving fertility. High biochar doses improved soil fertility as well as plant nutritional status and development. The increased water retention as a consequence of biochar amendment was not sufficient to overcome drought stress problems in the soil.", "Soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity dynamics following tillage ": "Soil bulk density (\u03c1\n                     b) may be purposely reduced in agricultural fields using tillage to improve hydraulic properties. However, tillage alters the soil structure, resulting in unstable soils. As the soil stabilizes, \u03c1\n                     b increases over time. While this is known, studies on soil hydraulic properties in tilled soils, including comparisons between tilled and non-tilled soils, commonly assume a rigid soil structure. This study presents changes in soil water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K\n                     sat) as \u03c1\n                     b increased dynamically with time following tillage at a loam-textured field site. Over the summer of 2015, soil cores were collected at several depths below the surface following precipitation events. Soil water retention curves and K\n                     sat were determined using pressure cells and the constant head method, respectively. Tillage reduced \u03c1\n                     b to 0.94\u202fg cm\u22123. Changes in \u03c1\n                     b increased with depth, reaching a \u03c1\n                     b of 1.11\u202fg cm\u22123 in the 0\u20135\u202fcm layer, and a \u03c1\n                     b of 1.42\u202fg cm\u22123 at the deepest tilled layer. Soil water retention curves were markedly steeper for samples with higher \u03c1\n                     b, indicating an overall increase in water retained at a soil matric potential (\u03a8) of \u221233\u202fkPa. Evaluation of two modeling approaches for water retention as a function \u03c1\n                     b indicated that changes in water retention with increases in \u03c1\n                     b could be reasonably estimated if a matching point was used. No clear relationship between K\n                     sat and \u03c1\n                     b was obvious for \u03c1\n                     b < 1.06\u202fcm3\u202fcm\u22123, but for \u03c1\n                     b > 1.06\u202fcm3\u202fcm\u22123, K\n                     sat decreased markedly (order of magnitude) as \u03c1\n                     b increased. Hydraulic properties varied strongly depending on time since tillage and soil depth, and results have implications for models of tilled soils, as well as for studies comparing tilled and non-tilled soils.", "Variability of soybean response to rhizobia inoculant, vermicompost, and a legume-specific fertilizer blend in Siaya County of Kenya ": "Rhizobia inoculation can increase soybean yield, but its performance is influenced by among others soybean genotype, rhizobia strains, environment, and crop management. The objective of the study was to assess soybean response to rhizobia inoculation when grown in soils amended with urea or vermicompost to improve nitrogen levels. Two greenhouse experiments and one field trial at two sites were carried out. The first greenhouse experiment included soils from sixty locations, sampled from smallholder farms in Western Kenya. The second greenhouse experiment consisted of one soil selected among soils used in the first experiment where inoculation response was poor. The soil was amended with vermicompost or urea. In the two greenhouse experiments, Legumefix (inoculant) + Sympal (legume fertilizer blend) were used as a standard package. Results from the second greenhouse experiment were then validated in the field. Analysis of variance was done using SAS statistical software and mean separation was done using standard error of the difference for shoot biomass, grain yield nodulation, nodule effectiveness and nutrient uptake. In the first greenhouse trial, soybean response to inoculation was significantly affected by soil fertility based on nodule fresh weight and shoot biomass. Soils with low nitrogen had low to no response to inoculation. After amendment, nodule fresh weight, nodule effectiveness, nodule occupancy, and shoot dry biomass were greater in the treatment amended with vermicompost than those amended with urea (Legumefix\u202f+\u202fSympal\u202f+\u202fvermicompost and Legumefix\u202f+\u202fSympal\u202f+\u202furea) respectively. Under field conditions, trends were similar to the second experiment for nodulation, nodule occupancy and nitrogen uptake resulting in significantly greater grain yields (475, 709, 856, 880, 966\u202fkg ha\u22121) after application of vermicompost at 0, 37, 74, 111, and 148\u202fkg N ha\u22121 respectively. It was concluded that soybean nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation in low fertility soils would not be suppressed by organic amendments like vermicompost up to 148\u202fkg N ha\u22121.", "Changes in soil microbial biomass with manure application in cropping systems: A meta-analysis ": "Soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and nitrogen (SMBN) are important indices of soil bio-fertility. While intensively managed cropping systems can reduce microbial biomass, application of manure is a potential way to rebuilt microbial biomass and improve soil functions. However, the responses of SMBC and SMBN to manure application relative to mineral fertilizers (NPK) in Chinese cropping systems remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis based on 103 peer-reviewed publications with 1448 paired observations to identify the degree to which climate types, soil properties and agricultural managements regulate the responses of microbial biomass to manure amendment relative to NPK. The results indicated that manure application increased SMBC, SMBN, SMBC/soil organic carbon (SOC) and SMBN/soil total nitrogen (TN) by 40%, 55%, 16% and 21%, respectively, across all the observations compared to NPK. SMBC/SMBN under manure amendment (6.58 in average) was lower than that in NPK (7.86 in average). Manure-related factors, e.g. manure types, duration of application, manure-C and N input rates, were the strongest regulators of the response of microbial biomass. Soil properties and climates also contributed to considerable degrees of variation in microbial biomass response based on variance partitioning analysis (VPA). Results of the random forest (RF) models showed that manure type, application rate (manure-C and N input) as well as soil initial properties (SOC, TN and clay contents) were likely the predominant factors controlling the response of microbial biomass to manure application. Our study indicates that manure application can be an effective way to restore the loss of microbial biomass due to intensive application of NPK, yet variations in response are determined by specific manure type, application rate, as well as local conditions of climate and inherent soil properties.", "Manure acts as a better fertilizer for increasing crop yields than synthetic fertilizer does by improving soil fertility ": "Fertilization is an important management strategy for crop yields by mediating soil fertility. However, rare studies quantitatively assessed the interactions among fertilization, crop yields, and soil fertility. Here, data from a 25-year fertilization experiment in the humid subtropical region of Southern China were used to evaluate and quantify the effect of fertilization on crop yields via soil fertility. Seven treatments were chosen: CK (non-fertilizer); N (synthetic nitrogen); NP (synthetic N and phosphorus); NPK (synthetic N, P and potassium); NPKM1 (synthetic NPK with manure); 1.5NPKM1 (1.5 times of NPKM1); and M2 (manure alone). Overall, the crop yields of wheat and maize under manure (1.36\u20131.58 and 3.85-5.82\u2009Mg ha\u22121) were higher than those under CK (0.34 and 0.25\u2009Mg ha\u22121) and synthetic fertilized treatments (0.27\u20130.97 and 0.48\u20132.65\u2009Mg ha\u22121), as the averaged of 1991\u20132015. Higher SOC stocks were found under the NPKM1, 1.5NPKM1, and M2 treatments with a pronounced increase in SOC over the first 10 years and stable over the last 15 years. By the boosted regression trees, manure, synthetic fertilizer and soil properties (SOC storage, soil pH, and soil nutrients) accounted for 39%, 21%, and 40% of the variation of the relative yield, respectively. Path analysis identified a network of inter-relations of manure, synthetic fertilizer, and soil properties in the relative yields. Compared to synthetic fertilized treatments, manure application strongly and positively affected the relative yield by increasing SOC storage, soil nutrients, and soil pH (path coefficients: 0.90, 0.88, and 0.76). These factors explained 72% of the crop yields' variance. These results suggest that manure application is a viable strategy for regulating crop yields due to its improvement in soil fertility.", "Soil compaction in cropping systems A review of the nature, causes and possible solutions": "Soil compaction is one of the major problems facing modern agriculture. Overuse of machinery, intensive cropping, short crop rotations, intensive grazing and inappropriate soil management leads to compaction. Soil compaction occurs in a wide range of soils and climates. It is exacerbated by low soil organic matter content and use of tillage or grazing at high soil moisture content. Soil compaction increases soil strength and decreases soil physical fertility through decreasing storage and supply of water and nutrients, which leads to additional fertiliser requirement and increasing production cost. A detrimental sequence then occurs of reduced plant growth leading to lower inputs of fresh organic matter to the soil, reduced nutrient recycling and mineralisation, reduced activities of micro-organisms, and increased wear and tear on cultivation machinery. This paper reviews the work related to soil compaction, concentrating on research that has been published in the last 15 years. We discuss the nature and causes of soil compaction and the possible solutions suggested in the literature. Several approaches have been suggested to address the soil compaction problem, which should be applied according to the soil, environment and farming system.\n                  The following practical techniques have emerged on how to avoid, delay or prevent soil compaction: (a) reducing pressure on soil either by decreasing axle load and/or increasing the contact area of wheels with the soil; (b) working soil and allowing grazing at optimal soil moisture; (c) reducing the number of passes by farm machinery and the intensity and frequency of grazing; (d) confining traffic to certain areas of the field (controlled traffic); (e) increasing soil organic matter through retention of crop and pasture residues; (f) removing soil compaction by deep ripping in the presence of an aggregating agent; (g) crop rotations that include plants with deep, strong taproots; (h) maintenance of an appropriate base saturation ratio and complete nutrition to meet crop requirements to help the soil/crop system to resist harmful external stresses.", "Soil labile organic carbon fractions and soil organic carbon stocks as affected by long-term organic and mineral fertilization regimes in the North China Plain ": "To improve C sequestration in soils and mitigate climate change, it is essential to understand how nutrient management strategies impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and labile fractions. This study was designed to explore changes in soil bulk density (BD), SOC concentrations, SOC stocks and soil labile organic C fractions (mineralizableC (Cmin), microbial biomass C (MBC), dissolved organic C (DOC), particulate organic C (POC), light fraction organic C (LFOC) and permanganate oxidizable C (KMnO4-C)) under 26-year fertilization regimes in a wheat-maize rotation system in the North China Plain. Soil from the following six treatments was analyzed: (1) Control with no amendment addition (CK); (2) Standard rate of mineral fertilizer treatment (SMF) reflecting local farmers' practice; (3) Standard rate of organic manure treatment (SMA) with total N input equal to SMF; (4) Half the standard rate of mineral fertilizer plus half the standard rate of organic manure treatment (1/2 SMF+1/2 SMA); (5) Double standard rate of mineral fertilizer treatment (DMF); (6) Double standard rate of organic manure treatment (DMA). Results showed that all long-term fertilization regimes significantly decreased BD in topsoil compared to CK except for SMF, with treatments that included organic manure resulting in the lowest BDs. Treatments that included organic manure had significantly higher SOC concentrations and stocks than mineral or unfertilized treatments. The organic manure treatments also had higher concentrations of non-labile C but at the same time a higher proportion of labile C than the mineral or unfertilized treatments. This was confirmed by the carbon management index (CMI) which was significantly increased by organic manure addition. Control and mineral fertilized treatments had higher efficiencies of C retention (RE) from added inputs (crop residues only). Differences in Cmin, POC and KMnO4-C were affected by differences in MA-C, however, changes in rhizodeposition-C, stubble-C and root-C significantly affected DOC, MBC and LFOC. This study demonstrates that fertilization strategies that include organic manure can increase the pool of stable C in the surface soil layer, while at the same time increasing concentrations and proportions of labile C. Organic manure use can therefore contribute to improved nutrient cycling services and higher soil quality in the North China Plain.", "Regulation of soil CO2 and N2O emissions by cover crops: A meta-analysis ": "Cover crops provide multiple agronomic and environmental benefits, such as enhanced soil carbon sequestration, aggregation, water infiltration, and reduced erosion and nutrient leaching compared with no cover crop. However, little is known regarding the effect of cover crop species, biomass quality and quantity, and method of residue placement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using meta-analysis, this study examined the effect of cover crop species, quality and quantity of biomass, and residue management on response ratios (RRs) of cover crops to no cover crop on CO2 and N2O emissions following cash crops. All cover crop species increased CO2 emissions, but reduced N2O emissions compared with no cover crop, except legumes which increased N2O emissions. Cover crop biomass explained 63% of variability in increased CO2 emissions and 55% of variability in decreased N2O emissions. Both CO2 and N2O emissions decreased polynomially with increased cover crop biomass C/N ratio, with greater rate of decline for legumes than nonlegumes. Cover crop residue incorporated into the soil increased CO2 and N2O emissions compared with the residue placed at surface or removed from the soil. Cover crops emitted lower CO2 and N2O emissions than no cover crops in silty loam and sandy clay loam soils, respectively, compared to clay loam and silty clay loam soils. Both soil organic carbon and total nitrogen increased with cover crop compared to no cover crop. Although CO2 and N2O emissions varied with cover crop species, using legume and nonlegume cover crop mixture to enhance residue C/N ratio compared to legumes and placing the residue at the surface instead of incorporating into the soil can reduce GHG emissions. Because of enhanced soil C and N storage and other known benefits, improvement in soil health and environmental quality due to cover crop may outweigh CO2 emissions compared to no cover crop.", "Impact of conservation tillage and nitrogen on sugarbeet yield and quality ": "Conventional intensive tillage (CT) is widely practiced in sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) growing regions. However, CT uses more labor and machinery and has negative impacts on soil and environment. Limited information exists for the performance of sugarbeet in reduced tillage compared to CT systems. A three-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate yield and quality of sugarbeet under no-till (NT), and strip-till (ST) systems compared to CT. The response of sugarbeet to the increasing rate of nitrogen (N) from 56 to 224\u2009kg ha\u22121 in each tillage system was also studied. Sugarbeet plant stand, root yield, root impurities (sodium, potassium, and amino-N concentration in the root), sucrose loss to molasses (SLM) and recoverable sucrose yield were measured. Tillage had no significant effect on plant stand, root yield, and recoverable sucrose yield. The estimated cost of tillage operation showed that growing sugarbeet under NT was 111 US$ ha\u22121 less than that in CT, which could be translated into 111 US$ ha\u22121 higher net benefit for growers considering the similar yields in both systems. Sugarbeet root yield linearly increased in response to increasing rate of N, however, sucrose concentration decreased and root impurities increased with increasing N input. Overall, little increase of recoverable sucrose yield was observed with N rate increasing from 56 to 224\u2009kg ha\u22121. Response to N rate occurred irrespective of tillage method.", "A new approach on the structural stability of soils: Method proposal ": "Water-dispersible clay analysis is used to evaluate soil structural stability, and two clay classes are quantified from it: the water-dispersible clay and the aggregated clay. We suggest here that three clay classes exist in soils with respect to structural behavior, and we propose a method for their quantification. Here, the aggregated clay is divided in two new classes, non-dispersible clay and water-re-flocculable clay. The method is based on a ten-fold dilution of the suspension obtained from water-dispersible clay analysis and successfully allowed the quantification of the proposed clay classes. The proposed method is inexpensive and does not require extra soil or chemical dispersants. Based on the distribution of these classes in different soils, seven groups of clay structural stability were defined. The method provides insights regarding soil structure-related processes, such as soil surface crusting, soil pore clogging, water erosion, and particles transport.", "Evaluation of best management practices for sediment and nutrient loss control using SWAT model ": "The intensive study of an individual watershed is required to develop effective and efficient watershed management plans. Identification of critical erosion-prone areas of the watershed and implementation of best management practices (BMPs) is necessary to control the watershed degradation by reducing the sediment and nutrient losses. The present study evaluates and recommends the BMPs in an agriculture-based Marol watershed (5092\u2009km2) of India, using a hydrologic model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). After successful calibration and validation, the model simulated daily/monthly discharge and sediment were found satisfactory throughout the simulation period. The model was then applied with a calibrated set of parameters for evaluating the effectiveness of various management practices for sediment and nutrient loss control. Keeping in mind the existing agricultural practices, socio-economic aspects and geography of the study area, the management practices were focused on four crops (Maize, Rice, Soybeans and Ground nut), three fertilization levels (high, medium and low), four tillage treatments (Field cultivator, Conservation tillage, Zero tillage and Mould board plough), and two conservation operations (Contour farming and Filter strips). The simulated annual average sediment yield from the watershed was found to be 12.2\u2009t.ha\u22121yr\u22121. The water balance analysis revealed that, the evapo-transpiration is predominant over the watershed (approximately 46.3% of the annual average rainfall). Reduction in sediment yield and nutrient loss was observed with alternate cropping treatments of Groundnut and Soybean, as compared to Paddy and Maize cultivation. Overall, based on simulated results, the field cultivator tillage practice and conservation practices viz., contour farming and filter strips, could be adopted to reduce sediment yield and nutrient losses in the critical sub-watersheds of the study area and in other watersheds with similar hydro-climatic conditions.", "Soil structure changes induced by tillage systems ": "Structure represents one of the main soil physical attributes indicators. The soil porous system (SPS) is directly linked to the soil structure. Water retention, movement, root development, gas diffusion and the conditions for all soil biota are related to the SPS. Studies about the influence of tillage systems in the soil structure are important to evaluate their impact in the soil quality. This paper deals with a detailed analysis of changes in the soil structure induced by conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems. Three different soil depths were studied (0\u201310, 10\u201320 and 20\u201330cm). Data of the soil water retention curve (SWRC), micromorphologic (impregnated blocks) (2D) and microtomographic (\u03bcCT) (3D) analyses were utilized to characterize the SPS. Such analyses enabled the investigation of porous system attributes such as: porosity, pore number and shape, pore size distribution, tortuosity and connectivity. Results from this study show a tri-modal pore size distribution (PSD) at depths 0\u201310 and 10\u201320cm for the soil under CT and a bi-modal PSD for the lower layer (20\u201330cm). Regarding the soil under NT, tri-modal PSDs were found at the three depths analyzed. Results based on the micromorphologic analysis (2D) showed that the greatest contribution to areal porosity (AP) is given by pores of round (R) shape for CT (52%: 0\u201310cm; 50%: 10\u201320cm; 67%: 20\u201330cm). Contrary to the results observed for CT, the soil under NT system gave the greatest contribution to AP, for the upper (0\u201310cm) and intermediate (10\u201320cm) layers, due to the large complex (C) pore types. For the \u03bcCT analysis, several types of pores were identified for each soil tillage system. Small differences in the macroporosity (MAP) were observed for the 0\u201310 and 20\u201330cm between CT and NT. A better pore connectivity was found for the 0\u201310cm layer under NT.", "Spatial analysis of soil aggregate stability in a small catchment of the Loess Plateau, China: II. Spatial prediction ": "As indicators of soil degradation vulnerability, soil aggregate stability indices play important roles in representing soil resistance to water erosion, and their spatial variability provides both agriculturally and environmentally important information. The spatial variability of aggregate stability indices is synergistically affected by the soil, topography, vegetation, and human factors. To understand the formation processes of aggregates by a spatial analysis, a prediction model combining soil properties with natural and human factors should be developed to improve the accuracy of the spatial interpolation of soil aggregate stability indices. In this study, the mean weight-diameter (MWD, mm), water-stable aggregates greater than 0.25\u2009mm (WSA>0.25, %) and soil erodibility factor (K factor) were satisfactorily predicted by multiple stepwise regression (MSR) and regression kriging (RK) based on soil properties and natural and human factors (0.436\u2264 R2 \u22640.578). In addition, spatial variability and prediction modeling of aggregate stability indices were highly dependent on the quantification of land use type and landscape structure (the spatial structure of landscape elements and the connections between the different ecosystem types or landscape elements). It has received little attention in previous studies. The exclusion of all soil variables did not affect the predictions of K factor, and for MWD and WSA>0.25, even though the performance of the models may appear relatively low, but also significant (0.183\u2264 R2 \u22640.312), indicating that the prediction of the spatial distributions of aggregate stability indices with easily available auxiliary data is practicable and effective. Residual maps showed that high residuals are distributed around built-up land (transportation land and residential land) or farmland, indicating that anthropogenic factors increase the uncertainty of the models. The spatial distribution maps of MWD, WSA>0.25 and K factor can be useful in landscape planning and decision making to minimize water erosion risks.", "Short-term effects of cover crops and tillage methods on soil physical properties and maize growth in a sandy loam soil ": "Soil compaction is a serious threat to agricultural production because of an expanding agricultural mechanization. Conservation tillage and use of pioneer plants can be an environmentally solution to alleviate the adverse effects of soil compaction. Root penetration into compacted soil of two winter cover crops with different rooting patterns, i.e. tap-rooted white mustard (Sinapis alba L.), and fibrous-rooted winter rye (Secale cereal L.), and of maize (Zea mays L.) in the consecutive growing season was assessed. Additionally, the effects of two spring tillage methods were evaluated, i.e. strip tillage and intensive tillage (by mouldboard ploughing). Winter rye showed significantly higher root penetration than white mustard in the top 15\u2009cm, while an opposite trend was observed at 20\u201345\u2009cm depth. After one season, maize root penetration was significantly greater following white mustard than winter rye at 30\u201340\u2009cm depth. Strip tillage, like intensive tillage, could sufficiently loosen soil for adequate maize growth even though maize root distribution was restricted to tilled rows in contrast with intensive tillage. In conclusion, white mustard already showed positive short-term effects on maize growth, whereas strip tillage did not negatively affect it. Combining both is a viable option to reduce the negative impact of soil compaction on maize growth.", "Effects of maize straw and its biochar application on organic and humic carbon in water-stable aggregates of a Mollisol in Northeast China: A five-year field experiment ": "In agricultural ecosystems, one optimized crop residue management practice, i.e., incorporating biochar produced from crop residues via pyrolysis to the soil, is considered a promising technology for mitigating climate change and improving soil quality. However, the potential mechanisms are still not well known. In this study, a five-year (2011\u20132015) field experiment in a Mollisol of Northeast China that included four treatments, i.e., CK (no fertilizer), NPK (mineral nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers), NPKS (NPK plus maize straw) and NPKB (NPK plus maize straw-derived biochar), was conducted to evaluate the effects of maize straw and its derived biochar application on the following: 1) the size distribution and water stability of soil aggregates; 2) the concentrations of organic and humic carbon (C) in bulk soil and water-stable aggregate fractions; and 3) the chemical compositions of organic and humic C in water-stable aggregate fractions. Compared with the CK and NPK treatments, the proportion of macroaggregates (>0.25\u2009mm) [mainly large macroaggregates (>2\u2009mm)] increased whereas the proportions of microaggregates (0.25\u20130.053\u2009mm) and silt\u2009+\u2009clay fractions (<0.053\u2009mm) decreased in NPKS and NPKB treatments, resulting in the mean weight diameter (MWD) of soil aggregates being higher under NPKS and NPKB treatments than under CK and NPK treatments. The concentrations of organic and humic C in bulk soil and aggregate fractions were also generally higher under NPKS and NPKB treatments than under CK and NPK treatments. The treatment effects were more apparent for NPKB than for NPKS. With respect to other treatments, the NPKB treatment significantly increased the ratios of macroaggregate- to microaggregate-associated organic C as well as humin C. The solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectra of small macroaggregates (2\u20130.25\u2009mm) and its humic acid fraction showed that the NPKS treatment did not alter the proportions of the C functional groups. In contrast, the NPKB treatment clearly decreased the proportions of alkyl C and O-alkyl C but increased the proportion of aromatic C, resulting in the alkyl C/O-alkyl C and hydrophobic C/hydrophilic C ratios being higher whereas the aliphatic C/aromatic C ratio was lower under NPKB than under other treatments. These findings indicate that the application of maize straw biochar enhanced soil aggregate stability and aggregate-associated organic and humic C concentrations. Biochar C was preferentially incorporated into macroaggregates and its humin fraction with respect to microaggregates. Moreover, the molecular structure of small macroaggregates and its HA fraction became more stable, hydrophobic and aromatic. Therefore, physical protection through organic C in aggregate fractions, physical-chemical protection through the encapsulation of humic C within aggregate fractions, and physical-biochemical protection through recalcitrant alkyl C and aromatic C within aggregate fractions may be the primary mechanisms for C preservation in biochar-amended soil. Our results suggested that maize straw biochar application was an effective strategy based on the comprehensive goal of mitigating climate change and improving soil quality in Mollisols of Northeast China.", "Soil carbon stocks under different land uses and the applicability of the soil carbon saturation concept ": "Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks via land management has been proposed as a temporary climate change mitigation measure. An upper limit of soil stable SOC storage, which refers to the concepts of SOC saturation has been proposed. Using systematic grid sampling of topsoil in mainland France and an equation that predicts this SOC saturation, we derived estimates of the SOC sequestration potential density (SOCspd) for various land uses. First, using French database and data from the literature we estimated the proportions of the SOC stored in the fine fraction (SOCfine) in total SOC for grassland (69%), cropland (85%) and forest (66%). Then, SOCspd was calculated as the difference between the theoretical SOC saturation value and SOCfine. The SOCspd stocks for French topsoil were estimated at about 1.1\u2009Pg, in which cropland, forest and grassland accounted for 66%, 17% and 17%, respectively. Varying the proportions of SOCfine in the calculations by assuming a possible range of 0.8-0.9 for cropland and 0.6-0.9 for grassland and forest soils led to variations of total SOCspd stocks of about 0.1\u2009Pg for each land use. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the distribution of SOCspd in forest soils is exactly centred at zero, which suggests that on average, forest topsoils are saturated in SOCfine, and thus Hassink\u2019s equation provides a valid estimate for the SOC sequestration potential for French topsoil.", "Diffusion and phosphorus solubility of biochar-based fertilizer: Visualization, chemical assessment and availability to plants ": "Developing slow-release phosphate sources more synchronized with the crop cycle is needed to increase phosphorus (P) use efficiency in weathered tropical soils. We hypothesized that impregnation of biomass with phosphate and magnesium prior to biochar production will generate slow-release P fertilizer and increase P use efficiency by plants. In this study, triple superphosphate (TSP) or phosphoric acid (H3PO4) were mixed with magnesium oxide (MgO) and poultry litter (PL) to produce slow-release P biochar-based fertilizers (BBFs). The P fractions of the BBFs soluble in water, citric acid and neutral ammonium citrate\u202f+\u202fwater were analyzed. Phosphorus diffusion in soil was determined using a visualization technique over time and chemical analyses, and the agronomic efficiency of the BBFs was compared with soluble fertilizer (TSP) in both granular and powder form for maize grown in an Oxisol under greenhouse conditions. Results showed that BBFs strongly decreased water-soluble P, which caused a slow-release of P in soil as demonstrated by diffusion visualization technique. When applied as powder mixed through the soil, BBFs improved soil pH and Mg and were able to provide P to plants similarly to TSP. The granular form of PLB-H3PO4-MgO was equivalent to TSP for P release during early growth of maize and preserved higher amounts of P in the granule, which can be used for plants in future harvests. Pyrolysis of biomass with phosphate and magnesium can be an option to enhance P use efficiency from fertilizers, especially for on high P-fixing soils.", "Spatial variability of soil thermal properties and their relationships with physical properties at field scale ": "Characterizing the spatial variability of soil thermal properties and quantifying their relationships with commonly measured soil physical properties is important for successful implementation of precision agriculture practices. However, such information at field scale is scarce. This study aimed to characterize the spatial variability of soil thermal properties and to quantify their spatial relationships with soil physical properties at a field scale. Measurements of soil water content (SWC) and thermal properties were carried out at 80 locations using a time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe and a heat pulse probe (Decagon KD2 Pro), respectively in a cultivated cornfield in southwestern QC, Canada. Soil texture and total organic carbon (TOC) at those locations were also determined in the laboratory. Both coefficient of variation (CV%) and variogram range showed a weak to moderate variability and spatial dependency for the soil properties which was attributed to the homogeneity of the soil, crop, and land management practices. Results of principle component analysis (PCA) indicated that the soil thermal properties and soil water content (SWC) had strong correlations with principle component 2 (PC2). The variogram ranges indicated that the soil thermal properties varied on a similar spatial scale as the SWC in the field. Cross variograms indicated strong spatial correlations between SWC and thermal properties, particularly thermal conductivity (k) and thermal diffusivity (D). Overall, results of this study showed that the SWC had a stronger influence on the spatial variability of soil thermal properties than the other properties such as TOC and soil texture at the field scale. Therefore, the results of this study could be useful for accurate modeling of the soil thermal regimes and mass-energy exchange processes at the field scale as well as developing successful agricultural management strategies such as precision irrigation. Future studies should explore the relationships between the thermal properties and other soil properties such as bulk density under various cropping systems.", "Underwater manipulators: A review ": "This paper describes the state-of-the art in the area of underwater robot manipulator systems. A brief introduction is given on the use of manipulators in various offshore industries for different subsea intervention applications. It provides a comprehensive summary of existing commercial and prototype underwater manipulators, covering relevant aspects such as design features, their capabilities and merits, and provides a detailed comparison. This is followed by a thorough analysis of advantages and disadvantages of both electrically and hydraulically actuated manipulators. Furthermore, a detailed description of commercially available underwater manipulator control systems is presented in order to provide a realistic picture of the existing technology and its limitation. In addition, an extensive bibliography covering research results in the field of control algorithms is presented, including low level motion control, high level kinematic control and motion planning schemes along with the implementation issues.", "Offshore wind installation vessels \u2013 A comparative assessment for UK offshore rounds 1 and 2 ": "Marine operations play a pivotal role throughout all phases of a wind farm\u2019s life cycle. In particular uncertainties associated with offshore installations can extend construction schedules and increase the capital expenditure (CAPEX) required for a given project. Installation costs typically account for approximately 30% of the overall project cost. This study considers the installation modelling for UK offshore Wind Rounds 1 and 2 using probabilistic simulation tool. The tool is used to output time-domain predictions for the completion of key installation phases. By varying key wind farm characteristics such as distance to shore and the number of turbines, an assessment of vessel performance was completed for each round by reviewing recorded durations predicted by the software. The results provide a quantification of installation vessel performance and the associated deviations present a measure of installation risk. It is identified that the Round 1 vessels experience less weather downtime but higher variability and the Round 2 vessels perform more consistently but experience larger delays. The paper provides a structured method to identify and benchmark offshore wind installation risks, to support developers and project planners.", "Lessons learned from offshore oil and gas incidents in the Arctic and other ice-prone seas ": "Specific risks to offshore oil and gas operations manifest in the Arctic and other harsh environments. Such extreme operating conditions can disrupt the offshore infrastructure and cause major accidents, posing a great challenge to operators. A thorough investigation of past incidents helps to learn lessons to ensure that a recurrence of serious accidents affecting workers and the environment can be prevented.\n                  The analysis of past incidents is divided into two parts. First, we offer a statistical analysis of offshore incidents triggered by natural events in the Arctic and in similar harsh environments. The analysis, organised by location, cause, and type of damage, failure mechanisms, and consequences, is based on data from the World Offshore Accident Database (WOAD). Second, we analyse a selection of accidents that occurred in the recent past in ice-prone seas, with particular attention to potential deficiencies in safety measures, design requirements and design methodologies, operations planning and component reliability.\n                  Based on the analysis, important lessons were identified which stress the need for further efforts to ensure the safety of workers and of assets and to get all actors involved in offshore operations engaged towards achieving a safer future for the exploitation of oil and gas resources.", "Full-scale unsteady RANS CFD simulations of ship behaviour and performance in head seas due to slow steaming ": "It is critical to be able to estimate a ship\u05f3s response to waves, since the resulting added resistance and loss of speed may cause delays or course alterations, with consequent financial repercussions. Slow steaming has recently become a popular approach for commercial vessels, as a way of reducing fuel consumption, and therefore operating costs, in the current economic and regulatory climate. Traditional methods for the study of ship motions are based on potential flow theory and cannot incorporate viscous effects. Fortunately, unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier\u2013Stokes computations are capable of incorporating both viscous and rotational effects in the flow and free surface waves. The key objective of this study is to perform a fully nonlinear unsteady RANS simulation to predict the ship motions and added resistance of a full scale KRISO Container Ship model, and to estimate the increase in effective power and fuel consumption due to its operation in waves. The analyses are performed at design and slow steaming speeds, covering a range of regular head waves, using a commercial RANS solver. The results are validated against available experimental data and are found to be in good agreement with the experiments. Also, the results are compared to those from potential theory.", "Swansea Bay tidal lagoon annual energy estimation ": "UK Energy policy is focused on the challenges posed by energy security and climate change, however, efforts to develop a low-carbon economy have overlooked tidal energy a vast and unexploited worldwide resource. Since 1981, UK tidal lagoon schemes have been recommended as an economically and environmentally attractive alternative to tidal barrages. More recently, two proposals for tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay have emerged and there have been several reports documenting the potential to harness significant tidal energy from Swansea Bay using a tidal lagoon. This paper assists in determining a realistic approximation of the energy generation potential in Swansea Bay, a numerical estimation is obtained from a zero dimension, 0D, \u2018backwards difference\u2019 computational model, utilising the latest turbine data available and high-resolution bathymetric data. This paper models the behaviour of the tidal lagoon in dual mode generation, in line with the above proposals. The results of model testing using a variety of fixed and variable parameters are displayed. The ebb mode model with provision for pumping at high tide is then explored further by carrying out optimisations of the starting head, number of turbines and turbine diameter in order to determine the maximum annual energy output from the tidal lagoon.", "Estimation of added resistance and ship speed loss in a seaway ": "The prediction of the added resistance and attainable ship speed under actual weather conditions is essential to evaluate the true ship performance in operating conditions and assess environmental impact. In this study, a reliable methodology is proposed to estimate the ship speed loss of the S175 container ship in specific sea conditions of wind and waves. Firstly, the numerical simulations are performed to predict the added resistance and ship motions in regular head and oblique seas using three different methods; a 2-D and 3-D potential flow method and a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with an Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach. Simulations of various wave conditions are compared with the available experimental data and these are used in a validation study. Secondly, following the validation study in regular waves, the ship speed loss is estimated using the developed methodology by calculating the resistance in calm water and the added resistance due to wind and irregular waves, taking into account relevant wave parameters and wind speed corresponding to the Beaufort scale, and results are compared with simulation results obtained by other researchers. Finally, the effect of the variation in ship speed and therefore the ship speed loss is investigated. This study shows the capabilities of the 2-D and 3-D potential methods and CFD to calculate the added resistance and ship motions in regular waves in various wave headings. It also demonstrates that the proposed methodology can estimate the impacts on the ship operating speed and the required sea margin in irregular seas.", "Advancements in the field of autonomous underwater vehicle ": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are robotic devices with a propulsion system for navigation and an onboard computer for decision making. AUV research is gaining popularity because of its extensive applications in fields from military to science. Robotic systems are need of the hour for exploration and environmental safety of the vast and deep oceans and water bodies. This paper presents current research trends in the field of AUVs and highlights future research directions. Here localization and navigation techniques such as inertial navigation to simultaneous localization and mapping being used in current AUVs are discussed in detail. Different optimal path planning and control methods are highlighted. Use of different sensor technology like sonar, laser, acoustic modems and stereo vision systems for localization, navigation and mapping is presented. Recent developments in underwater wireless communication along with the commercially available devices are discussed.", "A systematic Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis for offshore wind turbine systems towards integrated condition based maintenance strategies ": "Condition-based maintenance is applied in various industries to monitor and control critical assets and to optimize maintenance efforts. Its applicability to the offshore wind energy industry has been considered for almost 20 years and has resulted in the development and implementation of solutions that have contributed to lower cost of maintenance and increased asset availability. However, there is currently no public domain guidance available that provides the information required to (i) prioritize systems for which condition monitoring would generate highest value and to (ii) understand the parameters that need to be monitored by a specific system from failure cause to failure mode. Both items are addressed in this paper, providing a clearly structured, risk-based assessment methodology and corresponding results for state-of-the-art offshore wind turbines. A total of 337 failure modes have been identified and analysed by experts representing approximately 70% of the European offshore wind market to assess potential benefits of condition monitoring systems. Results may be used to target the development of condition monitoring systems focusing on critical systems and to find optimal O&M strategies by understanding failure paths of main offshore wind turbine systems resulting in a lower cost of energy and a more optimal risk-return balance.", "The implementation of technical energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction measures in shipping ": "Numerous energy efficiency and carbon reduction technologies have been identified within the shipping sector but their overall implementation remains unknown. It is important to know the implementation in order to establish a credible baseline and evaluate progress towards low carbon shipping. Using a cross-sectional survey of shipowners and operators this paper attempts to gauge the implementation of over thirty energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction technologies. The results show that whilst there is a good spread of implementation across the different measures, only a select number of measures in each of the categories are implemented at sufficient scale. Secondly, the measures with high implementation have tended to be those that have small energy efficiency gains at the ship level, and the uptake of CO2 reducing technologies, particularly alternative fuels is low despite their high potential for reducing CO2 emissions. If shipping's emissions are to be in line with other sectors in the future and follow a decarbonisation pathway, it would require higher implementation of energy efficiency and CO2 reducing technologies than those driven by current regulations alone.", "Integrated approach to vessel energy efficiency ": "Energy efficiency improvements in the shipping industry are being driven by economics, compliance and customer requirements. Whilst various technological and operation improvements are known and available, with many being demonstrated to be cost effective and with savings reported in the industry, their take up in the world fleet remains low. This low take-up can be considered due to many different barriers, as explored in various research studies. However the aim of this paper is first to understand how these barriers are created by considering how ship operations function day-to-day within the context of mainstream business practice. A holistic view of operations is required and is presented in this paper, including consideration of business focus areas in parallel with the functions of technical, operational and commercial stakeholders. With this laid-out, gaps within existing operations are discussed in relation to areas for practical improvements. From here, non-prescriptive mechanisms to enable a desired future are proposed; including the integration of mandates, processes and systems. Case studies are given throughout the paper using hull and propeller maintenance as a recurring example of a typical decision making processes and best practices.", "Statistical modelling of extreme ocean current velocity profiles ": "Knowledge about extreme ocean currents and their vertical structure is important when designing offshore structures. We propose a method for statistical modelling of extreme vertical current velocity profiles, accounting for factors such as directionality, spatial and temporal dependence, and non-stationarity due to the tide. We first pre-process the data by resolving the observed (vector) currents at each of several water depths into orthogonal major and minor axis components by principal component analysis, and use harmonic analysis to decompose the total (observed) current into the sum of (deterministic) tidal and (stochastic) residual currents. A complete marginal model is then constructed for all residual current components, and the dependence structure between the components is characterized using the conditional extremes model by Heffernan and Tawn (2004). By simulating under this model, estimates of various extremal statistics can be acquired. A simple approach for deriving design current velocity profiles is also proposed. The method is tested using measured current profiles at two coastal locations in Norway, covering a period of 2.5 and 1.5 years. It is demonstrated that the method provides good extrapolations at both locations, and the estimated 10-year design current velocity profiles appear realistic compared to the most extreme velocity profiles observed in the measurements.", "Maritime shipping and emissions: A three-layered, damage-based approach ": "Policy emphasis in ship design must be shifted away from global and idealized towards regional based and realistic vessel operating conditions. The present approach to reducing shipping emissions through technical standards tends to neglect how damages and abatement opportunities vary according to location and operational conditions. Since environmental policy originates in damages relating to ecosystems and jurisdictions, a three-layered approach to vessel emissions is intuitive and practical. Here, we suggest associating damages and policies with ports, coastal areas possibly defined as Emission Control Areas (ECA) as in the North Sea and the Baltic, and open seas globally. This approach offers important practical opportunities: in ports, clean fuels or even electrification is possible; in ECAs, cleaner fuels and penalties for damaging fuels are important, but so is vessel handling, such as speeds and utilization. Globally we argue that it may be desirable to allow burning very dirty fuels at high seas, due to the cost advantages, the climate cooling benefits, and the limited ecosystem impacts. We quantify the benefits and cost savings from reforming current IMO and other approaches towards environmental management with a three-layered approach, and argue it is feasible and worth considering.", "A semi-empirical ship operational performance prediction model for voyage optimization towards energy efficient shipping ": "Voyage optimization is a practice to select the optimum route for the ship operators to increase energy efficiency and reduce Green House Gas emission in the shipping industry. An accurate prediction of ship operational performance is the prerequisite to achieve these targets. In this paper, a modified Kwon\u05f3s method was developed to predict the added resistance caused by wave and wind for a specific ship type, and an easy-to-use semi-empirical ship operational performance prediction model is proposed. It can accurately predict the ship\u05f3s operational performance for a specific commercial ship under different drafts, at varying speeds and in varying encounter angles, and then enables the user to investigate the relation between fuel consumption and the various sea states and directions that the ship may encounter during her voyage. Based on the results from the operational performance prediction model and real time climatological information, different options for the ship\u05f3s navigation course can be evaluated according to a number of objectives, including: maximizing safety and minimizing fuel consumption and voyage time. By incorporating this into a decision support tool, the ship\u05f3s crew are able to make an informed decision about what is the best course to navigate.\n                  In this study the Energy Efficiency of Operation (EEO) is defined as an indicator to illustrate the ratio of main engine fuel consumption per unit of transport work. Two case studies are carried out to perform the prediction of ship operational performance for Suezmax and Aframax Oil Tankers, and the results indicate that the semi-empirical ship operational performance prediction model provides extremely quick calculation with very reasonable accuracy, particularly considering the uncertainties related to the parameters of interest for the case study data. Within the case studies, the additional fuel consumption caused by the combined hull and propeller fouling and engine degradation is included in the model as a time-dependent correction factor. The factor may assist the ship owner/operator to determine the hull coating selection, and/or the dry-docking and main engine maintenance strategy.", "Fuel usage data analysis for efficient shipping operations ": "There are incentives from maritime regulatory bodies to operate ships more efficiently, driven by the need to reduce CO2 budget.\n                  In order to establish more efficient ship operations, fuel consumption across the full operational profile of a vessel is needed. This could be accomplished through a complete characterisation through extensive sea-trials, or interpretation of data from monitoring systems. Results from repeated testing under controlled sea-trial conditions provides high-fidelity data, however, this approach is prohibitively expensive and requires repeating as the condition of the vessel changes with time. Conversely, data monitoring devices are relatively inexpensive, however, the process of analysing data can be complex, particularly when a ship\u05f3s activities are diverse.\n                  This paper describes a methodology for associating ship activity with corresponding segments of a data-stream from a commercially available monitoring system. Further analysis is then performed to determine the fuel efficient performance of the ship. The case-study used is a harbour tug, although the approach used is applicable to other ship types, its success on this basis indicates the methodology is robust. To validate the methodology, results from the data analysis are compared to fuel consumption data measured under sea-trial conditions, and are found to be in close agreement.", "Experimental and numerical studies on added resistance of ship in oblique sea conditions ": "In this paper, the added resistance of a large tanker is estimated experimentally and numerically in oblique sea. Experiments on ship motion response and added resistance in oblique sea are performed in the SSPA seakeeping basin. The experiments are conducted using the self-propulsion test for seven wave directions between 180\u00b0 and 0\u00b0. In the self-propulsion test, the added resistance is estimated from the difference between the thrust of the propeller in calm water and waves. In the case of the head sea, the results are compared with those obtained from the captive test at the towing test of Seoul National University. As numerical method, two methods are selected: the strip method and the 3D Rankine panel method. The maximum value of the added resistance is observed between the incident wave directions of 180\u00b0 and 150\u00b0. From 120\u00b0, the added resistance tends to decrease and the peak of the added resistance shifted to the short waves. Through the two numerical analysis methods, the tendency of added resistance and the cause of the change of the added resistance in the oblique sea are investigated.", "Dynamic and structural performances of offshore floating wind turbines in turbulent wind flow ": "A realistic turbulent wind field differs from a steady uniform one, in terms of the wind shear, the turbulence intensity and the coherence structure. Although it has been clear that an offshore floating wind turbine will behave differently in the turbulent wind, the individual effect of the above three items are not investigated sufficiently until now. The primary objective of the present research is to investigate in details how the wind shear, the turbulence intensity and the coherence influence the dynamic and structural responses of offshore floating wind turbines. Aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupled simulation of a semi-submersible floating wind turbine is run in time-domain. The wind shear has a limited effect on the global responses of the floating wind turbine although its influence on each individual blade is considerable. Comparatively, the floating wind turbine is quite sensitive to the turbulence intensity. In a wind field with high turbulence intensity, the platform motions become more violent and the structural loads are increased substantially. The proper orthogonal decomposition method is used to investigate the coherence quantitatively. A partial coherence structure helps to reduce the flow variation seen by the rotor and thereby beneficial to the safety of the floating wind turbine.", "Current status and future of ocean energy sources: A global review ": "In this study, detailed information about the fundamentals, energy and power potentials, devices, technologies, installed capacities, annual generation, and future of ocean energy sources: tidal, wave, temperature and salinity gradients are given as an up to date global review. Detailed analysis showed that aggregate global annual potential of different ocean energy sources is significantly greater than our global annual electricity demand. As a result, many countries around the globe aim to utilise ocean energy sources for power generation. However, this is currently not possible on a large scale because most of the ocean energy technologies are still under development and there are many economic, technical and environmental problems to be solved. Therefore, the research and development in ocean energy engineering should be fostered by governments and private sector around the globe so that we can use these reliable and clean renewable energy sources for supplying our increasing global electricity demand. Finally, this study could offer some assistance to the academia and industry for the utilisation of different ocean energy sources for achieving a sustainable future.", "Aeration effects on water-structure impacts: Part 2. Wave impacts on a truncated vertical wall ": "Aeration effects on wave loading are of considerable importance for offshore design. This paper describes experimental work to investigate four types of wave impact on a truncated vertical wall (representative of a plate in an FPSO vessel), in pure and aerated water. Investigations showed that high aeration and flip-through wave impacts are the most severe impact types and should therefore be considered for offshore structure design. It was also observed that there is a significant reduction in peak impact loads (both pressure and force) for impacts in aerated water compared to those in pure water. However, there was almost no reduction in impulsive loadings in aerated water compared to those in pure water, and therefore maximum instantaneous loads may be conservative in the presence of aerated water, in the implementation for offshore structure design. This paper is a companion paper to \u201cAeration effects on water-structure impacts: Part 1. Drop plate impacts\u201d.", "A numerical and experimental investigation of the effect of side walls on hydrodynamic model testing in a wave flume ": "The side wall effect was normally tackled by potential flow based numerical methods. It is well known that, due to the existence of the resonance frequency in the wave tank, the numerical methods over-predict the hydrodynamic forces when comparing with model experiments. Furthermore, in most of the previous studies on the effects of the side walls, the model was located at the centre of the tank, the disturbances on both sides of the model are symmetric, and the resonances of some of the responses such as wave surface elevation and motions may not be excited at the tank natural frequencies. In the present study, a Rankine source panel method is used to tackle the effects of the side walls and artificial damping is introduced in the free surface boundary condition to account for the viscous damping effect. Model experiments are carried out for a lifeboat model located at various positions in a wave flume. Numerical results of the wave forces, free surface elevations and motions of the model are compared with the model test measurements, and good agreement is found. It is shown that the inclusion of the artificial damping in the free surface boundary condition is effective, in particular for the model at off-centre position of the tank.", "Hybrid floating breakwater-WEC system: A review ": "Ocean wave energy is attractive for its large reserves, exploitability and low emissions. Although many Wave Energy Converter (WEC) concepts have been proposed, high construction cost hinders the engineering application of WECs. Similar challenges arise in the applications of floating breakwaters. The construction cost can be reduced by combining different structures as one integrated system which has the advantage of cost-sharing, space-sharing and multi-functionality. This integrated design approach has stimulated the rapid development of the hybrid system combining floating breakwaters and WECs in recent years. The novel floating breakwater-WEC system is often classified as a wave-energy-utilizing type floating breakwater. The different approaches for integrating floating breakwaters and WECs are summarized in this review. The hydrodynamic performance and power take-off performance of these hybrid floating breakwater-WEC systems are the focus of this review. The insights gained from previous studies of this kind of system and the potential challenges for further developments of this technology are also provided. The cost-sharing and multi-function of the breakwater-WEC system can help facilitate the engineering application of the floating breakwaters and WECs.", "Ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from AIS data ": "Since the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), AIS data has proven to be a valuable source of ship behavior analysis using data mining. It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 F\n                              \n                              \n                                 1\n                              \n                           \n                           score\n                        \n                     , and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.", "Path planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicle formations in a practical maritime environment ": "Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have been deployed over the past decade. Current USV platforms are generally of small size with low payload capacity and short endurance times. To improve effectiveness there is a trend to deploy multiple USVs as a formation fleet. This paper presents a novel computer based algorithm that solves the problem of USV formation path planning. The algorithm is based upon the fast marching (FM) method and has been specifically designed for operation in dynamic environments using the novel constrained FM method. The constrained FM method is able to model the dynamic behaviour of moving ships with efficient computation time. The algorithm has been evaluated using a range of tests applied to a simulated area and has been proved to work effectively in a complex navigation environment.", "Three-dimensional trajectory tracking of a hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of underwater current ": "In this work, a six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) nonlinear kinematic and dynamic model of a Hybrid Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (H-AUV) is derived for the two modes of locomotion, propelled and gliding modes. A comprehensive linearization algorithm is developed to include both modes of locomotion. Starting with a three-dimensional time-parameterized curve of position history, Frenet-Serret frames are used to specify the unknown nominal states, which in turn are used to obtain the nominal inputs. A linear time-variant (LTV) state-space model is obtained, and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed and applied to the nonlinear model. The performance of the devised controller is assessed via a metric that computes the error between the actual and the desired position. Simulation results show that the LQR provides accurate tracking performance, even in the presence of underwater currents with bounded flow velocity. Moreover, the controller autonomously switches modes between propulsion and gliding to ensure minimal trajectory tracking error and energy consumption.", "Modelling of soil-structure-interaction for flexible caissons for offshore wind turbines ": "Published foundation models and procedures for calculation of caisson foundation response typically assume a rigid caisson in deformable soil. However, recent published measurement data from a prototype suction bucket jacket has revealed that the lid flexibility of the caisson foundations significantly influences the dynamic foundation stiffness felt by the jacket legs. This paper investigate this soil-structure-interaction problem and presents a modelling approach for including the effect of caisson flexibility in a macro-element. The macro-element, originally developed by assuming a rigid foundation, was modified by included a stiffness correction and a procedure to account for changes in the elastic coupling between horizontal load and moment due to the caisson flexibility. The modified macro-element successfully re-produced the response to general load paths computed by geotechnical finite element analyses, where the foundation was modelled in detail with structural elements and the surrounding soil was represented by continuum elements. The general principles behind the modification is generic in the sense that it can be implemented in other foundation models.", "Power-saving device for air bubble generation using a hydrofoil to reduce ship drag: Theory, experiments, and application to ships ": "We have developed a new power-saving device to reduce the drag of a ship\u2019s hull using small bubbles. The device reduces the energy required for bubble generation. The device, which consists of angled hydrofoils with air introducers, uses the low-pressure region produced above the hydrofoil as the ship moves forward to drive atmospheric air into the water. We describe the device principles obtained from simple fluid dynamic theory, and, through experiments performed in a small towing tank, show the fundamental air entrainment and bubble generation processes for the flow behavior around a hydrofoil beneath a free surface. We also present a semi-empirical scaling process for practical application to full-size ships to estimate the net drag reduction achieved by this device. Finally, the results of a series of full-scale tests are reported and show that, with correct operation, our device can produce a net power saving of 5\u201315% for ships.", "Antibiotic Resistance Genes in the Human-Impacted Environment: A One Health Perspective ": "Antibiotic resistance and its environmental component are gaining more attention as part of combating the growing healthcare crisis. The One Health framework, promulgated by many global health agencies, recognizes that antimicrobial resistance is a truly inter-domain problem in which human health, animal agriculture, and the environment are the core and interrelated components. This prospectus presents the status and issues relevant to the environmental component of antibiotic resistance, namely, the needs for advancing surveillance methodology: the environmental reservoirs and sources of resistance, namely, urban wastewater treatment plants, aquaculture production systems, soil receiving manure and biosolid, and the atmosphere which includes longer range dispersal. Recently, much work has been done describing antibiotic resistance genes in various environments; now quantitative, mechanistic, and hypothesis-driven studies are needed to identify practices that reduce real risks and maintain the effectiveness of our current antibiotics as long as possible. Advanced deployable detection methods for antibiotic resistance in diverse environmental samples are needed in order to provide the surveillance information to identify risks and define barriers that can reduce risks. Also needed are practices that reduce antibiotic use and thereby reduce selection for resistance, as well as practices that limit the dispersal of or destroy antibiotic-resistant bacteria or their resistance genes that are feasible for these varied environmental domains.", "Soil Microbiomes\u2014a Promising Strategy for Contaminated Soil Remediation: A Review ": "Bioremediation is a process mediated by microorganisms and represents a sustainable and eco-friendly way to degrade and detoxify environmental contaminants. Soil microbiomes clearly become a key component of bioremediation as they are more stable and efficient than pure cultures, being recognized as one of the scientific frontiers of the soil environmental science and technology fields. Recently, many advancements have been made regarding the investigation of remediation mechanisms by soil microbiomes and the interactions inside them. This has greatly expanded our ability to characterize the remediating function of soil microbiomes and identify the factors that influence their efficiency for remediation. Here, we suggest that soil microbiomes are a promising strategy for soil remediation. Research is now needed to identify how we can manipulate and manage soil microbiomes to improve remediation efficiency and increase soil fertility at the same time. Therefore, this review aims to emphasize the importance of soil microbiomes in bioremediation and promote further development of this strategy into a widely accepted technique.", "Biochar Combined with Vermicompost Increases Crop Production While Reducing Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide Emissions from a Paddy Soil ": "Organic amendments such as vermicompost and biochar have been reported to enhance soil fertility and crop productivity. However, whether the co-application of both amendments has synergistic effects or whether such benefits are accompanied by the risk of gaseous nitrogen (N) loss in an agroecosystem remains unknown. A soil column experiment with a fully factorial design was conducted using three levels of vermicompost (no dose, low dose (1%, weight:weight), and high dose (3%, weight:weight)) without or with biochar (1%, weight:weight) to investigate their effects on rice growth and gaseous N loss across the crop growing season. Our results demonstrated that synergistic interactions existed between vermicompost and biochar in promoting crop yield. Compared with biochar amendment alone, biochar combined with vermicompost significantly (P < 0.01) increased rice yield by 26.5%\u201335.3%. However, high dose of vermicompost significantly (P < 0.01) increased the cumulative ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. In the presence of vermicompost, the incorporation of biochar amendment significantly (P < 0.01) decreased the cumulative N2O emission by 14.1%\u201318.6%. The lowest emission factor value of NH3 and N2O was achieved using biochar in combination with low dose of vermicompost. This study revealed that the combination of biochar and moderate dose of vermicompost offers a novel approach to promote crop productivity while reducing the environmental risk.", "Microbial Degradation of Organophosphate Pesticides: A Review ": "Pesticides have become an inevitable part of the modern environment as they are widely used in agriculture, household, and public health sectors and, hence, are extensively distributed throughout most ecosystems. Currently, organophosphate pesticides are the most commercially favored group of pesticides, with large application areas all over the world. Depending on their fate, these organophosphorus compounds may become bioavailable for microbial degradation. Environmental microbes, such as Aspergillus, Pseudomonas, Chlorella, and Arthrobacter, are capable of coupling a variety of physical and biochemical mechanisms for the degradation of organophosphate pesticides, including adsorption, hydrolysis of P\u2013O alkyl and aryl bonds, photodegradation, and enzymatic mineralization. Enzymes, such as esterase, diisopropyl fluorophosphatase, phosphotriesterase, somanase, parathion hydrolase, and paraoxonase, have been isolated from microbes to study and understand the catabolic pathways involved in the biotransformation of these xenobiotic compounds. This review highlights various aspects of biodegradation of organophosphate pesticides along with biological and molecular characterization of some organophosphate pesticide-degrading bacteria.", "Siderophore-Producing Rhizobacteria as a Promising Tool for Empowering Plants to Cope with Iron Limitation in Saline Soils: A Review ": "Iron (Fe) bioavailability to plants is reduced in saline soils; however, the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are not yet completely understood. Siderophore-expressing rhizobacteria may represent a promising alternative to chemical fertilizers by simultaneously tackling salt-stress effects and Fe limitation in saline soils. In addition to draught, plants growing in arid soils face two other major challenges: high salinity and Fe deficiency. Salinity attenuates growth, affects plant physiology, and causes nutrient imbalance, which is, in fact, one of the major consequences of saline stress. Iron is a micronutrient essential for plant development, and it is required by several metalloenzymes involved in photosynthesis and respiration. Iron deficiency is associated with chlorosis and low crop productivity. The role of microbial siderophores in Fe supply to plants and the effect of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on the mitigation of saline stress in crop culture are well documented. However, the dual effect of siderophore-producing PGPR, both on salt stress and Fe limitation, is still poorly explored. This review provides a critical overview of the combined effects of Fe limitation and soil salinization as challenges to modern agriculture and intends to summarize some indirect evidence that argues in favour of siderophore-producing PGPR as biofertilization agents in salinized soils. Recent developments and future perspectives on the use of PGPR are discussed as clues to sustainable agricultural practices in the context of present and future climate change scenarios.", "Surfactant-Enhanced Soil Washing for Removal of Petroleum Hydrocarbons from Contaminated Soils: A Review ": "An increase in energy demand leads to further exploration, transportation, and utilization of petroleum, which creates severe soil contamination because of recurrent accidents and oil spills. Remediation of these contaminated soils is challenging. Among many treatment methods practiced for remediation of petroleum-contaminated soils, surfactant-enhanced soil washing has been widely practiced as a preferred treatment option, as it is a fast and environmentally accepted method. In this paper, we review research undertaken on various anionic, nonionic, cationic, biological, and mixed surfactants for the remediation of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils. Upcoming surfactants like gemini and switchable surfactants are summarized. We assess the challenges and opportunities of in-situ and ex-situ soil washing, the mechanisms of surfactant-enhanced soil washing, and the criteria to follow for surfactant selection. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the operational and environmental factors affecting soil washing efficiency and soil and surfactant properties affecting surfactant adsorption. We also describe the advantages of coupling soil washing with effluent treatment and surfactant reuse challenges and opportunities. Moreover, challenges and possible new directions for future research on surfactant-enhanced soil washing are proposed.", "Pedotransfer Functions for Estimating Soil Hydraulic Properties: A Review ": "Characterization of soil hydraulic properties is important to environment management; however, it is well recognized that it is laborious, time-consuming and expensive to directly measure soil hydraulic properties. This paper reviews the development of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) used as an alternative tool to estimate soil hydraulic properties during the last two decades. Modern soil survey techniques like satellite imagery/remote sensing has been used in developing PTFs. Compared to mechanistic approaches, empirical relationships between physical properties and hydraulic properties have received wide preference for predicting soil hydraulic properties. Many PTFs based on different parametric functions can be found in the literature. A number of researchers have pursued a universal function that can describe water retention characteristics of all types of soils, but no single function can be termed generic though van Genuchten (VG) function has been the most widely adopted. Most of the reported parametric PTFs focus on estimation of VG parameters to obtain water retention curve (WRC). A number of physical, morphological and chemical properties have been used as predictor variables in PTFs. Conventionally, regression algorithms/techniques (statistical/neural regression) have been used for calibrating PTFs. However, there are reports of utilizing data mining techniques, e.g., pattern recognition and genetic algorithm. It is inferred that it is critical to refine the data used for calibration to improve the accuracy and reliability of the PTFs. Many statistical indices, including root mean square error (RMSE), index of agreement (d), maximum absolute error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (r\n                     2) and correlation coefficient (r), have been used by different researchers to evaluate and validate PTFs. It is argued that being location specific, research interest in PTFs will continue till generic PTFs are developed and validated. In future studies, improved methods will be required to extract information from the existing database.", "Benefits of Biochars and NPK Fertilizers for Soil Quality and Growth of Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) in an Acid Arenosol ": "Fertilization is required for optimum plant growth, particularly in unfertile soils, while optimizing nutrient use efficiency is an alternative to reduce inorganic fertilizer needs and reduce environmental problems caused by nutrient leaching. This study investigated soil properties and cowpea yield responses to biochars (BCs) made from different feedstocks, baby corn peel biochar (BC1), branches of mango tree biochar (BC2), and rice husk biochar (BC3), applied in combination with nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizers. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, using an acid sandy soil (Arenosol) that was submitted for 70 d to the following eight treatments: i) control; ii) full dose of NPK (a commercial compound fertilizer (12-24-12 of N-P2O5-K2O) + urea (46% N)); iii) BC1 + half dose of NPK; iv) BC1 + full dose of NPK; v) BC2 + half dose of NPK; vi) BC2 + full dose of NPK; vii) BC3 + half dose of NPK; and viii) BC3 + full dose of NPK. All biochars were applied at a rate of 0.9% (weight/weight), and each type of biochar was combined with half and full doses of NPK fertilizers. Soil pH increased significantly (P < 0.05) in treatments with BC1 and BC2, while cation exchange capacity (CEC) and available P were higher in the treatments with BC1; BC1 and BC2 also induced higher activity of enzymes related to the P cycle and higher cowpea yield. Similar soil properties and cowpea yield parameters were obtained with the full and half doses of NPK fertilizers for each type of biochar used. In conclusion, biochars in the combination with NPK fertilizers improved soil chemistry and enzymatic activities, allowing reduced fertilizer application and food production costs in the acid soil studied.", "Responses of Soil Microbial Community Structure and Activity to Incorporation of Straws and Straw Biochars and Their Effects on Soil Respiration and Soil Organic Carbon Turnover ": "Like straw, biochar incorporation can influence soil microorganisms and enzyme activities and soil carbon (C) responses; however, few studies have compared the various effects of straw and biochar and the underlying mechanisms. An experiment was performed to study the changes in soil respiration (SR) and soil organic C (SOC) fluxes in response to the incorporation of three kinds of straw (reed, smooth cordgrass, and rice) and their pyrolyzed products (biochars) at Chongming Island, China. In addition, the microbial activity and community structure of some amended soils were also analyzed to clarify the mechanisms of these responses. The results showed that all biochar incorporation (BC) induced lower SR than the corresponding unpyrolyzed straw incorporation (ST), and the average SR in the soils following BC and ST during the experimental periods was 21.69 and 65.32 \u03bcmol CO2 m\u22122 s\u22121, respectively. Furthermore, the average SOC content was 16.97 g kg\u22121 following BC, which was higher than that (13.71 g kg\u22121) following ST, indicating that compared to ST, BC was a low-C strategy, even after accounting for the C loss during biochar production. Among the BC treatments, reed-BC induced the lowest SR (17.04 \u03bcmol CO2 m\u22122 s\u22121), whereas smooth cordgrass-BC induced the highest SR (27.02 \u03bcmol CO2 m\u22122 s\u22121). Furthermore, in contrast with ST, BC significantly increased the abundance of some bacteria with poorer mineralization or better humification ability, which led to lower SR. The lower easily oxidizable C (EOC) and higher total C contents of biochars induced lower SR and higher SOC in the soil following BC compared to that following ST. Among the BC treatments, the higher total nitrogen content of rice biochar led to significantly higher soil microbial biomass, and the lower EOC content of reed biochar led to lower soil microbial activity and SR.", "Estimation of the van Genuchten Soil Water Retention Properties from Soil Textural Data ": "The van Genuchten (vG) function is often used to describe the soil water retention curve (SWRC) of unsaturated soils and fractured rock. The objective of this study was to develop a method to determine the vG model parameter m from the fractal dimension. We compared two approaches previously proposed by van Genuchten and Lenhard et al. for estimating m from the pore size distribution index of the Brooks and Corey (BC) model. In both approaches we used a relationship between the pore size distribution index of the BC model and the fractal dimension of the SWRC. A dataset containing 75 samples from the UNSODA unsaturated soil hydraulic database was used to evaluate the two approaches. The statistical parameters showed that the approach by Lenhard et al. provided better estimates of the parameter m. Another dataset containing 72 samples from the literature was used to validate Lenhard's approach in which the SWRC fractal dimension was estimated from the clay content. The estimated SWRC of the second dataset was compared with those obtained with the Rosetta model using sand, silt, and clay contents. Root mean square error values of the proposed fractal approach and Rosetta were 0.081 and 0.136, respectively, indicating that the proposed fractal approach performed better than the Rosetta model.", "Soil-Plant-Microbe Interactions in Stressed Agriculture Management: A Review ": "The expected rise in temperature and decreased precipitation owing to climate change and unabated anthropogenic activities add complexity and uncertainty to agro-industry. The impact of soil nutrient imbalance, mismanaged use of chemicals, high temperature, flood or drought, soil salinity, and heavy metal pollutions, with regard to food security, is increasingly being explored worldwide. This review describes the role of soil-plant-microbe interactions along with organic manure in solving stressed agriculture problems. Beneficial microbes associated with plants are known to stimulate plant growth and enhance plant resistance to biotic (diseases) and abiotic (salinity, drought, pollutions, etc.) stresses. The plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and mycorrhizae, a key component of soil microbiota, could play vital roles in the maintenance of plant fitness and soil health under stressed environments. The application of organic manure as a soil conditioner to stressed soils along with suitable microbial strains could further enhance the plant-microbe associations and increase the crop yield. A combination of plant, stress-tolerant microbe, and organic amendment represents the tripartite association to offer a favourable environment to the proliferation of beneficial rhizosphere microbes that in turn enhance the plant growth performance in disturbed agro-ecosystem. Agriculture land use patterns with the proper exploitation of plant-microbe associations, with compatible beneficial microbial agents, could be one of the most effective strategies in the management of the concerned agriculture lands owing to climate change resilience. However, the association of such microbes with plants for stressed agriculture management still needs to be explored in greater depth.", "Characteristics and Source Identification of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Urban Soils: A Review ": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are mainly produced by combustion processes and consist of a number of toxic compounds. They are always emitted as a mixture and have become a major type of pollutants in urban areas. The degree of soil contamination by PAHs is of special concern in areas immediately in proximity to cities with heavy traffic, factories, older buildings, and infrastructure. The accumulation of soil PAHs is also affected by non\u2013anthropogenic factors, such as climate, vegetation, and soil property. This paper reviews three typical source identification techniques, including diagnostic ratios, positive matrix factorization, and principle components analysis. The advantages or disadvantages of these techniques are analyzed. It is recommended that multiple identification techniques be used to determine the sources in order to minimize the weaknesses inherent in each method and thereby to strengthen the conclusions for PAH source identification.", "Soil Bulk Density Estimation Methods: A Review ": "Measurement of soil bulk density is important for understanding the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil. Accurate and rapid soil bulk density measurement techniques play a significant role in agricultural experimental research. This review is a comprehensive summary of existing measurement methods and evaluates their advantages, disadvantages, potential sources of error, and directions for future development. These techniques can be broadly categorised as direct and indirect methods. Direct methods include core, clod, and excavation sampling, whereas indirect methods include the radiation and regression approaches. The core method is most widely used, but it is time consuming and difficult to use for sampling multiple soil depths. The size of the coring cylinder used, operator experience, sampling depth, and in-situ soil moisture content significantly affect its accuracy. The clod method is suitable for use with heavy clay soils, and its accuracy is dependent on equipment calibration, drying time, and operator experience, but the process is complicated and time consuming. Excavation techniques are most commonly used to evaluate the bulk density of forest soils, but have major limitations as they cannot be used in soils with large pores and their measurement accuracy is strongly influenced by soil texture and the type of analysis selected. The indirect methods appear to have greater accuracy than direct approaches, but have higher costs, are more complex, and require greater operator experience. One such approach uses gamma radiation, and its accuracy is strongly influenced by soil depth. Regression methods are economical as they can make indirect measurements, but these depend on good, quality data of soil texture and organic matter content and geographical and climatic properties. Also, like most of the other approaches, its accuracy decreases with sampling depth.", "Remediation of Organochlorine Pesticide-Contaminated Soils by Surfactant-Enhanced Washing Combined with Activated Carbon Selective Adsorption ": "Remediation of organochlorine pesticide (OCP)-contaminated soils is urgently required especially in China. The present study investigated the removal of OCPs from two soils by triton X-100 (TX-100)-enhanced washing coupled with powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption treatment of the solution. Two contaminated soils, including a silt clay contaminated with chlordene, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethanes (DDDs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and a sandy loam containing chlordanes and mirex, were selected. Effects of varied operating parameters, including TX-100 dosage, liquid/soil (L/S) ratio, and extraction time, on the contaminant removal were examined. For both soils, OCP removal was clearly enhanced with increasing TX-100 in extraction solution and L/S ratio. Meanwhile, the removal efficacy was also impacted by soil texture and characteristics and contents of the contaminants. Moreover, by using PAC as an absorbent, a significant decrease in the contaminants in the extraction solutions was detected, and TX-100 could be further reused. Our investigation suggests that surfactant-enhanced washing combined with activated carbon selective adsorption would be an alternative to remediate OCP-contaminated soils.", "Immobilization of Lead and Cadmium in Contaminated Soil Using Amendments: A Review ": "Since the inception of industrial revolution, metal refining plants using pyrometallurgical processes have generated the prodigious emissions of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd). As the core target of such pollutants, a large number of soils are nowadays contaminated over widespread areas, posing a great threat to public health worldwide. Unlike organic pollutants, Pb and Cd do not undergo chemical or microbial breakdown and stay likely in site for longer duration after their release. Immobilization is an in-situ remediation technique that uses cost-effective soil amendments to reduce Pb and Cd availability in the contaminated soils. The Pb and Cd contamination in the soil environment is reviewed with focus on source enrichment, speciation and associated health risks, and immobilization options using various soil amendments. Commonly applied and emerging cost-effective soil amendments for Pb and Cd immobilization include phosphate compounds, liming, animal manure, biosolids, metal oxides, and biochar. These immobilizing agents could reduce the transfer of metal pollutants or residues to food web (plant uptake and leaching to subsurface water) and their long-term sustainability in heavy metal fixation needs further assessment.", "Remediation of Heavy Metal-Polluted Agricultural Soils Using Clay Minerals: A Review ": "Heavy metal contamination of agricultural soils poses risks and hazards to humans. The remediation of heavy metal-polluted soils has become a hot topic in environmental science and engineering. In this review, the application of clay minerals for the remediation of heavy metal-polluted agricultural soils is summarized, in terms of their remediation effects and mechanisms, influencing factors, and future focus. Typical clay minerals, natural sepiolite, palygorskite, and bentonite, have been widely utilized for the in-situ immobilization of heavy metals in soils, especially Cd-polluted paddy soils and wastewater-irrigated farmland soils. Clay minerals are able to increase soil pH, decrease the chemical-extractable fractions and bioavailability of heavy metals in soils, and reduce the heavy metal contents in edible parts of plants. The immobilization effects have been confirmed in field-scale demonstrations and pot trials. Clay minerals can improve the environmental quality of soils and alleviate the hazards of heavy metals to plants. As main factors affecting the immobilization effects, the pH and water condition of soils have drawn academic attention. The remediation mechanisms mainly include liming, precipitation, and sorption effects. However, the molecular mechanisms of microscopic immobilization are unclear. Future studies should focus on the long-term stability and improvement of clay minerals in order to obtain a better remediation effect.", "Soil Characteristics Overwhelm Cultivar Effects on the Structure and Assembly of Root-Associated Microbiomes of Modern Maize ": "Modern breeding primarily targets crop yield traits and is likely to influence root-associated microbiomes, which play significant roles in plant growth and health. The relative importance of soil and cultivar factors in shaping root-associated microbiomes of modern maize (Zea mays L.) remains uncertain. We conducted a pot experiment in a controlled environment using three soils (Mollisol, Inceptisol, and Ultisol) and four contrasting cultivars, Denghai 605, Nonghua 816, Qiaoyu 8, and Zhengdan 958, which are widely planted in China. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the bacterial communities in the bulk soil, rhizosphere, and endosphere. Our results showed that the four cultivars had different shoot biomass and root exudate total organic carbon and organic acid contents. The microbiomes in the bulk soil, rhizosphere, and endosphere were different. We observed apparent community divergence between soils rather than cultivars, within which edaphic factors substantially contributed to microbiome variation. Moreover, permutational multivariate analysis of variance corroborated significant contributions of soil type but not cultivar on the root-associated microbiome structure. Differential abundance analysis confirmed that each soil presented a distinct root microbiome, while network analysis indicated different co-occurrence patterns of the root microbiome among the three soils. The core root microbiome members are implicated in plant growth promotion and nutrient acquisition in the roots. In conclusion, root-associated microbiomes of modern maize are much more controlled by soil characteristics than by cultivar root exudation. Our study is anticipated to help improve breeding strategies through integrative interactions of soils, cultivars, and their associated microbiomes.", "Potential Use of a Poultry Manure Digestate as a Biofertiliser: Evaluation of Soil Properties and Lactuca sativa Growth ": "Anaerobic digestion is a process that is widely used for the treatment of organic wastes. The digestate can be used as a soil amendment or crop fertiliser. The aims of our work were to evaluate 1) the physicochemical composition and pathogen content in a digestate from poultry manure, according to international regulations, and 2) the effect of its soil application on the major chemical and biological soil properties and on the growth of Lactuca sativa. The experiment consisted of two groups of pots (with and without crop). Treatments applied to each group were as follows: low and high doses of digestate and inorganic fertiliser, and no application (control) (low dose: 70 kg nitrogen (N) ha\u22121 and 21 kg phosphorus (P) ha\u22121; high dose: 210 kg N ha\u22121 and 63 kg P ha\u22121). Soil samples were taken 7 and 34 d (harvest) after treatment applications. Heavy metal and pathogen contents in the digestate were below the upper limit values. Despite the high pH and electrical conductivity values of the digestate, both soil parameters presented acceptable values for crop growth. Although there were no initial increases in total inorganic N and available P in soil with digestate application, an increase in the fresh weight of crop was observed with the high dose application. This is probably associated with the slow nutrient release from the digestate during the development of the crop. Changes in the microbial community were temporary and occurred at the initial sampling stage of the experiment.", "Advances in Tropical Soil Characterization via Portable X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry ": "Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometers can be used to determine the elemental composition easily, rapidly, and without using chemical reagents, which is very important for tropical regions due to the lack of detailed soil characterization data. Moreover, pXRF data can be used to predict the results of more expensive, time-consuming, and conventional laboratory analyses. This study sought to determine the elemental composition of various soil profiles using pXRF. Two operational modes (Trace Mode and General Mode) and two scanning time (30 and 60 s) were assessed to determine their effects on the correlation of pXRF dataset with respect to conventional inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-optical emission spectrometry analysis. This relationship has been reported in previous studies, however, few studies were performed on tropical soils, which are unique. Furthermore, such relationships establish the viability of developing prediction models directly from pXRF data. Linear regression was applied to develop calibration models for the prediction of ICP analysis results and exchangeable and available elemental contents based on pXRF data. High coefficients of determination (R\n                     2) were obtained for Ca (0.87), Cu (0.90), Fe (0.95), Mn (0.85), Cr (0.95), V (0.72), and Ni (0.90), with adequate validation. Statistically significant results were not found for Al, K, Zn, Ti, and Zr. The models predicting the exchangeable Ca based on the total Ca from pXRF reached an R\n                     2 of up to 0.85. Operational modes influenced the pXRF results. Our results illustrate that pXRF holds great promise for tropical soil characterization and the development of prediction models, justifying the need for larger-scale studies in tropical countries worldwide.", "Soil Erodibility and Physicochemical Properties of Collapsing Gully Alluvial Fans in Southern China ": "In southern China, collapsing gully erosion produces massive deposits of sediment on the plough layer of alluvial fan farmland, leading to reduced nutrients, increased erodibility, and even desertification. The aim of this study was to investigate soil erodibility (the factor K in the universal Soil Loss Equation, USLE) and physicochemical properties of the alluvial fans of the most severe collapsing gully erosion areas (Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces) in southern China. The soils of the collapsing gully alluvial fans had a higher bulk density, but a lower total porosity, saturated water content, and silt and clay fractions than the control (CK) soils from the farmland without desertification. Soil quality gradually decreased from fan edge to fanhead. Significant decreases were found in soil pH, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and total potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus, as well as available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, resulting in a gradual decrease in soil nutrients from the fanedge to the fanhead. Soil erodibility was greatest in the fanhead, and soil erodibility K values of the alluvial fans were 53.71%, 66.28%, 67.53%, and 71.68 % greater than that in those of the CK soils of Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong, respectively, indicating a significant correlation between the soil erodibility K values and physicochemical properties, particularly sand fraction and organic matter content. The results provide new insights into the relationship between soil physicochemical properties and erodibility of alluvial fans, and suggest that improving soil structure might increase soil fertility in the collapsing gully alluvial fan farmland.", "Use of Biochar as an Amendment for Remediation of Heavy Metal-Contaminated Soils: Prospects and Challenges ": "Biochar (BC), known as the new black gold, is a stable, novel carbonaceous by-product that is synthesized through pyrolysis of biological materials in the absence of O2. Recently, an emerging interest in the application of BC as a robust soil amendment has given rise to a broad research area in science and technology. It is considered a promising remediation option for heavy metal (HM)-contaminated soils to reduce HM bioavailability to plants. Remediation efficacy of BC depends on the porosity, composition, pyrolysis temperature, feedstock, and residence time of pyrolysis. This review article aimed to present an overview of BC use in the immobilization of HMs, i.e., Cd, As, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cu, Mn, Cr, and Sb, in contaminated soils. The remaining uncertain factors, including the specific soil HM immobilization mechanisms, long-term beneficial effects, and potential environmental risks associated with BC application are analyzed. Future research must be conducted to ensure that the management of environmental pollution is in accord with ecological sustainability and adaptation of the black gold biotechnology on a commercial basis for immobilization of HMs in contaminated soils.", "Soil Metagenome of Tropical White Sand Heath Forests in Borneo: What Functional Traits Are Associated with an Extreme Environment Within the Tropical Rainforest? ": "White sand heath forests (WS) or kerangas, an unusual variant of tropical forests in Borneo, characterized by open scrubby vegetation, low productivity, and distinctive plant species composition and soil microbial community, are regarded as a stressful low-pH and/or nutrient environment. We investigated whether the functional soil metagenome also shows a predicted set of indicators of stressful conditions in WS. Based on stress-tolerant strategies exhibited by larger organisms, we hypothesized that genes for stress tolerance, dormancy, sporulation, and nutrient processing are more abundant in the soil microbiota of WS. We also hypothesized that there is less evidence of biotic interaction in white sand soils, with lower connectivity and fewer genes related to organismic interactions. In Brunei, we sampled soils from a WS and a normal primary dipterocarp forest, together with an inland heath, an intermediate forest type. Soil DNA was extracted, and shotgun sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq platform, with classification by the Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (MG-RAST). The results, on one hand, supported our hypothesis (on greater abundance of dormancy, virulence, and sporulation-related genes). However, some aspects of our results showed no significant difference (specifically in stress tolerance, antibiotic resistance, viruses, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs)). It appears that in certain respects, the extreme white sand environment produces the predicted strategy of less biotic interaction, but exhibits high soil microbiota connectivity and functional diversity.", "Potential Benefits of Biochar in Agricultural Soils: A Review ": "Soil degradation, characterized by declines in nutrient status and simultaneous accumulation of pesticide residues, is a major problem affecting agricultural ecosystems. Previous studies indicate that biochar application to soil has promise as a practical method to alleviate these pressures: increasing crop yield and enhancing pesticide degradation. Here, we review the roles of biochar in both chemical and biological promotion of pesticide degradation and the potential benefits of biochar relating to the efficiency of fertilizer use, availability of nutrients, and nutrient exchange. Biochar typically has a high surface area featuring many functional groups, a high cation exchange capacity, and high stability. Major factors that impact on the nutrient retention characteristics of biochar (e.g., feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, and application rate) are also discussed herein. Nonetheless, more studies of the long-term impacts on soil properties from biochar addition are still required before it can be possible to accurately quantify the sustainability of this approach to sequester carbon and restore soil function.", "Removing Moisture Effect on Soil Reflectance Properties: A Case Study of Clay Content Prediction ": "Visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectroscopy is an efficient approach for predicting soil properties because it reduces the time and cost of analyses. However, its advantages are hampered by the presence of soil moisture, which masks the major spectral absorptions of the soil and distorts the overall spectral shape. Hence, developing a procedure that skips the drying process for soil properties assessment directly from wet soil samples could save invaluable time. The goal of this study was twofold: proposing two approaches, partial least squares (PLS) and nearest neighbor spectral correction (NNSC), for dry spectral prediction and utilizing those spectra to demonstrate the ability to predict soil clay content. For these purposes, we measured 830 samples taken from eight common soil types in Israel that were sampled at 66 different locations. The dry spectrum accuracy was measured using the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and the average sum of deviations squared (ASDS), which resulted in low prediction errors of less than 8% and 14%, respectively. Later, our hypothesis was tested using the predicted dry soil spectra to predict the clay content, which resulted in R\n                     2 of 0.69 and 0.58 in the PLS and NNSC methods, respectively. Finally, our results were compared to those obtained by external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) and direct standardization (DS). This study demonstrates the ability to evaluate the dry spectral fingerprint of a wet soil sample, which can be utilized in various pedological aspects such as soil monitoring, soil classification, and soil properties assessment.", "Humus-Rich Compost Increases Lettuce Growth, Nutrient Uptake, Mycorrhizal Colonisation, and Soil Fertility ": "Sandy soils, typical of Australia's west, either have little or no habitat protection for microbes including arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which are essential for nutrient cycling. To minimize this problem, the application of organic matter, such as humus-rich composts, is necessary during vegetable crop production. This study aimed at determining the effects of humus-rich composts on either indigenous or inoculated AM fungal colonisation in roots, lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. Quechua) growth, and soil fertility improvement. Four different humus-rich composts with varying humus contents were applied at the same standard rate to lettuce grown under glasshouse conditions for 10 weeks after sowing and compared with two low-humus composts and non-amended soil (control). Humus-rich composts significantly increased lettuce shoot growth, root growth, and AM fungal colonisation in roots. Humus contents in the composts were also correlated with lettuce shoot and root growth. Soil dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and fertility were increased with the application of humus-rich composts. These humus-rich composts, especially the compost of higher humic acid with and without AM inoculation, might have a significant role in sustainable vegetable production, for example lettuce growth. Overall, the results indicate that supplementation with humus-rich compost is highly beneficial to enhance soil fertility and potentially maintain the sustainability of vegetable production.", "Mapping cropland extent of Southeast and Northeast Asia using multi-year time-series Landsat 30-m data using a random forest classifier on the Google Earth Engine Cloud ": "Cropland extent maps are useful components for assessing food security. Ideally, such products are a useful addition to countrywide agricultural statistics since they are not politically biased and can be used to calculate cropland area for any spatial unit from an individual farm to various administrative unites (e.g., state, county, district) within and across nations, which in turn can be used to estimate agricultural productivity as well as degree of disturbance on food security from natural disasters and political conflict. However, existing cropland extent maps over large areas (e.g., Country, region, continent, world) are derived from coarse resolution imagery (250\u2009m to 1\u2009km pixels) and have many limitations such as missing fragmented and\\or small farms with mixed signatures from different crop types and\\or farming practices that can be, confused with other land cover. As a result, the coarse resolution maps have limited useflness in areas where fields are small (<1\u2009ha), such as in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, coarse resolution cropland maps have known uncertainties in both geo-precision of cropland location as well as accuracies of the product. To overcome these limitations, this research was conducted using multi-date, multi-year 30-m Landsat time-series data for 3\u2009years chosen from 2013 to 2016 for all Southeast and Northeast Asian Countries (SNACs), which included 7 refined agro-ecological zones (RAEZ) and 12 countries (Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Japan, North Korea, Laos, South Korea, and Brunei). The 30-m (1 pixel\u2009=\u20090.09\u2009ha) data from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) were used in the study. Ten Landsat bands were used in the analysis (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, Thermal, NDVI, NDWI, LSWI) along with additional layers of standard deviation of these 10 bands across 1\u2009year, and global digital elevation model (GDEM)-derived slope and elevation bands. To reduce the impact of clouds, the Landsat imagery was time-composited over four time-periods (Period 1: January- April, Period 2: May-August, and Period 3: September-December) over 3-years. Period 4 was the standard deviation of all 10 bands taken over all images acquired during the 2015 calendar year. These four period composites, totaling 42 band data-cube, were generated for each of the 7 RAEZs. The reference training data (N\u2009=\u20097849) generated for the 7 RAEZ using sub-meter to 5-m very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) helped generate the knowledge-base to separate croplands from non-croplands. This knowledge-base was used to code and run a pixel-based random forest (RF) supervised machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing environment to separate croplands from non-croplands. The resulting cropland extent products were evaluated using an independent reference validation dataset (N\u2009=\u20091750) in each of the 7 RAEZs as well as for the entire SNAC area. For the entire SNAC area, the overall accuracy was 88.1% with a producer\u2019s accuracy of 81.6% (errors of omissions\u202f=\u202f18.4%) and user\u2019s accuracy of 76.7% (errors of commissions\u202f=\u202f23.3%). For each of the 7 RAEZs overall accuracies varied from 83.2 to 96.4%. Cropland areas calculated for the 12 countries were compared with country areas reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and other national cropland statistics resulting in an R2 value of 0.93. The cropland areas of provinces were compared with the province statistics that showed an R2\u2009=\u20090.95 for South Korea and R2\u2009=\u20090.94 for Thailand. The cropland products are made available on an interactive viewer at www.croplands.org and for download at National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC): https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/1281.", "Detailed agricultural land classification in the Brazilian cerrado based on phenological information from dense satellite image time series ": "The paradox between environmental conservation and economic development is a challenge for Brazil, where there is a complex and dynamic agricultural scenario. This reinforces the need for effective methods for the detailed mapping of agriculture. In this work, we employed land surface phenological metrics derived from dense satellite image time series to classify agricultural land in the Cerrado biome. We used all available Landsat images between April 2013 and April 2017, applying a weighted ensemble of Radial Basis Function (RBF) convolution filters as a kernel smoother to fill data gaps such as cloud cover and Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off data. Through this approach, we created a dense Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data cube with an 8-day temporal resolution and derived phenometrics for a Random Forest (RF) classification. We used a hierarchical classification with four levels, from land cover to crop rotation classes. Most of the classes showed accuracies higher than 90%. Single crop and Non-commercial crop classes presented lower accuracies. However, we showed that phenometrics derived from dense Landsat-like image time series, in a hierarchical classification scheme, has a great potential for detailed agricultural mapping. The results are promising and show that the method is consistent and robust, being applicable to mapping agricultural land throughout the entire Cerrado.", "Multi-Data Approach for remote sensing-based regional crop rotation mapping: A case study for the Rur catchment, Germany ": "Spatial land use information is one of the key input parameters for regional agro-ecosystem modeling. Furthermore, to assess the crop-specific management in a spatio-temporal context accurately, parcel-related crop rotation information is additionally needed. Such data is scarcely available for a regional scale, so that only modeled crop rotations can be incorporated instead. However, the spectrum of the occurring multiannual land use patterns on arable land remains unknown. Thus, this contribution focuses on the mapping of the actually practiced crop rotations in the Rur catchment, located in the western part of Germany. We addressed this by combining multitemporal multispectral remote sensing data, ancillary information and expert-knowledge on crop phenology in a GIS-based Multi-Data Approach (MDA). At first, a methodology for the enhanced differentiation of the major crop types on an annual basis was developed. Key aspects are (i) the usage of physical block data to separate arable land from other land use types, (ii) the classification of remote sensing scenes of specific time periods, which are most favorable for the differentiation of certain crop types, and (iii) the combination of the multitemporal classification results in a sequential analysis strategy. Annual crop maps of eight consecutive years (2008\u20132015) were combined to a crop sequence dataset to have a profound data basis for the mapping of crop rotations. In most years, the remote sensing data basis was highly fragmented. Nevertheless, our method enabled satisfying crop mapping results. As an example for the annual crop mapping workflow, the procedure and the result of 2015 are illustrated. For the generation of the crop sequence dataset, the eight annual crop maps were geometrically smoothened and integrated into a single vector data layer. The resulting dataset informs about the occurring crop sequence for individual areas on arable land, so that crop rotation schemes can be derived. The resulting dataset reveals that the spectrum of the practiced crop rotations is extremely heterogeneous and contains a large amount of crop sequences, which strongly diverge from model crop rotations. Consequently, the integration of remote sensing-based crop rotation data can considerably reduce uncertainties regarding the management in regional agro-ecosystem modeling. Finally, the developed methods and the results are discussed in detail.", "Monitoring sugarcane growth response to varying nitrogen application rates: A comparison of UAV SLAM LiDAR and photogrammetry ": "The capabilities and utility of UAV LiDAR and surface from motion photogrammetry have been of wide discussion in the remote sensing community and assumptions made, often speculative, about the potential strengths and limitations of these systems. Here, we employ a side-by-side test of the CSIRO Hovermap LiDAR and Micasense RedEdge multispectral camera simultaneously mounted to a single UAV platform to acquire a time-series data set from both sensors over the growth cycle of a sugarcane crop in northeast Queensland, Australia. The primary aim was to compare the ability of each system to accurately measure crop height, over a single growing cycle. A secondary aim examined the correlation between these measures and the sugarcane biophysical parameters of stalk population (stalks\u00b7m\u22122), total fresh biomass (TFB, t\u00b7ha-1) and cane yield (Yield, t cane\u00b7ha-1). The experimental design included a randomised complete block design of four nitrogen fertiliser treatments (0, 70, 110, 150 and 190 Nkg\u00b7ha-1) with four replications to assess if either optical measure could detect significant effects of nitrogen application on crop growth. Both systems demonstrated similar capabilities for accurately measuring crop heights throughout the growth period with statistically significant coefficients of determination observed when comparing the maximum (AdjR2 = .885, F(1,118) = 910.806, p \u2264 .001) and mean (AdjR2 = .929, F(1,118) = 1548.404, p \u2264 .001) crop height estimations of both instruments. In addition, both systems responded similarly in the detection of differences in crop structural properties response to nitrogen treatments. Only Hovermap, however, demonstrated the capacity to obtain sufficient ground returns over the course of the growth period to enable comparisons to the biophysical samples using a ground-to-non-ground return ratio (Stalk Population: \n                     AdjR2 = .788, F(1,18) = 70.688, p \u2264 .001, TFB: AdjR2 = .713, F(1,18) = 48.198, p \u2264 .001, Yield: \n                     AdjR2 = .707, F(1,18) = 46.921, p \u2264 .001) with the best results of RedEdge obtained when comparing mean height measures (Stalk Population \n                     AdjR2 = .502, F(1,18) = 20.172, p \u2264 .001, TFB: AdjR2 = .309, F(1,18) = 9.481, p = 0.006, Yield: AdjR2 = .322, F(1,18) = 10.028, p \u2264 .005). The results suggest that although both systems are comparable for accurate crop height measurements, and as such, provide early detection of potential problems, UAV LiDAR provided more consistent and significant correlations with optical remotely sensed data to the biophysical parameters of sugarcane.", "Global data and tools for local forest cover loss and REDD+ performance assessment: Accuracy, uncertainty, complementarity and impact ": "Assessing the performance of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) requires data on forest cover change. Innovations in remote sensing and forest monitoring provide ever-increasing levels of coverage, spatial and temporal detail, and accuracy. More global products and advanced open-source algorithms are becoming available. Still, these datasets and tools are not always consistent or complementary, and their suitability for local REDD+ performance assessments remains unclear. These assessments should, ideally, be free of any confounding factors, but performance estimates are affected by data uncertainties in unknown ways. Here, we analyse (1) differences in accuracy between datasets of forest cover change; (2) if and how combinations of datasets can increase accuracy; and we demonstrate (3) the effect of (not) doing accuracy assessments for REDD+ performance measurements.\n                  Our study covers five local REDD+ initiatives in four countries across the tropics. We compared accuracies of a readily available global forest cover change dataset and a locally modifiable open-source break detection algorithm. We applied human interpretation validation tools using Landsat Time Series data and high-resolution optical imagery. Next, we assessed whether and how combining different datasets can increase accuracies using several combination strategies. Finally, we demonstrated the consequences of using the input datasets for REDD+ performance assessments with and without considering their accuracies and uncertainties.\n                  Estimating the amount of deforestation using validation samples could substantially reduce uncertainty in REDD+ performance assessments. We found that the accuracies of the various data sources differ at site level, although on average neither one of the input products consistently excelled in accuracy. Using a combination of both products as stratification for area estimation and validated with a sample of high-resolution data seems promising. In these combined products, the expected trade-offs in accuracies across change classes (before, after, no change) and across accuracy types (user\u2019s and producer\u2019s accuracy) were negligible, so their use is advantageous over single-source datasets. More locally calibrated wall-to-wall products should be developed to make them more useful and applicable for REDD+ purposes. The direction and degree of REDD+ performance remained statistically uncertain, as CIs were overlapping in most cases for the deforestation estimates before and after the start of the REDD+ interventions. Given these uncertainties and inaccuracies and to increase the credibility of REDD+ it is advised to (1) be conservative in REDD+ accounting, and (2) not to rely on results from single currently available global data sources or tools without sample-based validation if results-based payments are intended to be made on this basis.", "An empirical standardized soil moisture index for agricultural drought assessment from remotely sensed data ": "We propose a simple, spatially invariant and probabilistic year-round Empirical Standardized Soil Moisture Index (ESSMI) that is designed to classify soil moisture anomalies from harmonized multi-satellite surface data into categories of agricultural drought intensity. The ESSMI is computed by fitting a nonparametric empirical probability density function (ePDF) to historical time-series of soil moisture observations and then transforming it into a normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Negative standard normal values indicate dry soil conditions, whereas positive values indicate wet soil conditions. Drought intensity is defined as the number of negative standard deviations between the observed soil moisture value and the respective normal climatological conditions. To evaluate the performance of the ESSMI, we fitted the ePDF to the Essential Climate Variable Soil Moisture (ECV SM) v02.0 data values collected in the period between January 1981 and December 2010 at South\u2013Central America, and compared the root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) of residuals with those of beta and normal probability density functions (bPDF and nPDF, respectively). Goodness-of-fit results attained with time-series of ECV SM values averaged at monthly, seasonal, half-yearly and yearly timescales suggest that the ePDF provides triggers of agricultural drought onset and intensity that are more accurate and precise than the bPDF and nPDF. Furthermore, by accurately mapping the occurrence of major drought events over the last three decades, the ESSMI proved to be spatio-temporal consistent and the ECV SM data to provide a well calibrated and homogenized soil moisture climatology for the region. Maize, soybean and wheat crop yields in the region are highly correlated (r\n                     >0.82) with cumulative ESSMI values computed during the months of critical crop growing, indicating that the nonparametric index of soil moisture anomalies can be used for agricultural drought assessment.", "Comparison of two-dimensional multitemporal Sentinel-2 data with three-dimensional remote sensing data sources for forest inventory parameter estimation over a boreal forest ": "National Forest Inventories (NFI) are key data and tools to better understand the role of forests in the global carbon budget. Traditionally inventories have been carried out as field work, which makes them laborious and expensive. In recent years, the development of various remote sensing techniques to improve the cost-efficiency of the NFIs has accelerated. The goal of this study is to determine the usability of open and free multitemporal multispectral satellite images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite constellation and to compare their usability in forest inventories against airborne laserscanning (ALS) and three-dimensional data obtained with high-resolution optical satellite images from WorldView-2 and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) stereo data from TerraSAR-X. Ground reference consisted of field data collected over 74 boreal forest plots in Southern Finland in 2014 and 2016. Features utilizing both single- and multiple-date information were designed and tested for Sentinel-2 data. Due to high cloud cover, only four Sentinel-2 images were available for the multitemporal feature analysis of all reference plots within the monitoring window. Random Forest technique was used to find the best descriptive feature sets to model five forest inventory parameters (mean height, mean diameter at breast height, basal area, volume, above-ground biomass) from all input remote sensing data. The results confirmed that the higher spatial resolution input data correlated with more accurate forest inventory parameter predictions, which is in line with other results presented in literature. The addition of temporal information to the Sentinel-2 results showed limited variation in prediction accuracy between the single and multidate cases ranging from 0.45 to 1.5 percentage points, whereof mean height, basal area and aboveground biomass are lower for single date with relative RMSEs of 14.07%, 20.66% and 24.71% respectively. Diameter at breast height and volume are lower for multi date feature combination with relative RMSEs of 18.38% and 27.21%. The results emphasize the importance of obtaining more evenly distributed data acquisitions over the growing season to fully exploit the potential of temporal features.", "Evaluating the relationship between biomass, percent groundcover and remote sensing indices across six winter cover crop fields in Maryland, United States ": "Winter cover crops are an essential part of managing nutrient and sediment losses from agricultural lands. Cover crops lessen sedimentation by reducing erosion, and the accumulation of nitrogen in aboveground biomass results in reduced nutrient runoff. Winter cover crops are planted in the fall and are usually terminated in early spring, making them susceptible to senescence, frost burn, and leaf yellowing due to wintertime conditions. This study sought to determine to what extent remote sensing indices are capable of accurately estimating the percent groundcover and biomass of winter cover crops, and to analyze under what critical ranges these relationships are strong and under which conditions they break down. Cover crop growth on six fields planted to barley, rye, ryegrass, triticale or wheat was measured over the 2012\u20132013 winter growing season. Data collection included spectral reflectance measurements, aboveground biomass, and percent groundcover. Ten vegetation indices were evaluated using surface reflectance data from a 16-band CROPSCAN sensor. Restricting analysis to sampling dates before the onset of prolonged freezing temperatures and leaf yellowing resulted in increased estimation accuracy. There was a strong relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and percent groundcover (r\n                     2\n                     =0.93) suggesting that date restrictions effectively eliminate yellowing vegetation from analysis. The triangular vegetation index (TVI) was most accurate in estimating high ranges of biomass (r\n                     2\n                     =0.86), while NDVI did not experience a clustering of values in the low and medium biomass ranges but saturated in the higher range (>1500kg/ha). The results of this study show that accounting for index saturation, senescence, and frost burn on leaves can greatly increase the accuracy of estimates of percent groundcover and biomass for winter cover crops.", "Assessment of RapidEye vegetation indices for estimation of leaf area index and biomass in corn and soybean crops ": "Leaf area index (LAI) and biomass are important indicators of crop development and the availability of this information during the growing season can support farmer decision making processes. This study demonstrates the applicability of RapidEye multi-spectral data for estimation of LAI and biomass of two crop types (corn and soybean) with different canopy structure, leaf structure and photosynthetic pathways. The advantages of Rapid Eye in terms of increased temporal resolution (\u223cdaily), high spatial resolution (\u223c5m) and enhanced spectral information (includes red-edge band) are explored as an individual sensor and as part of a multi-sensor constellation. Seven vegetation indices based on combinations of reflectance in green, red, red-edge and near infrared bands were derived from RapidEye imagery between 2011 and 2013. LAI and biomass data were collected during the same period for calibration and validation of the relationships between vegetation indices and LAI and dry above-ground biomass. Most indices showed sensitivity to LAI from emergence to 8m2/m2. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the red-edge NDVI and the green NDVI were insensitive to crop type and had coefficients of variations (CV) ranging between 19 and 27%; and coefficients of determination ranging between 86 and 88%. The NDVI performed best for the estimation of dry leaf biomass (CV=27% and r\n                     2\n                     =090) and was also insensitive to crop type. The red-edge indices did not show any significant improvement in LAI and biomass estimation over traditional multispectral indices. Cumulative vegetation indices showed strong performance for estimation of total dry above-ground biomass, especially for corn (CV\u226420%). This study demonstrated that continuous crop LAI monitoring over time and space at the field level can be achieved using a combination of RapidEye, Landsat and SPOT data and sensor-dependant best-fit functions. This approach eliminates/reduces the need for reflectance resampling, VIs inter-calibration and spatial resampling.", "Improved estimation of leaf area index and leaf chlorophyll content of a potato crop using multi-angle spectral data \u2013 potential of unmanned aerial vehicle imagery ": "In addition to single-angle reflectance data, multi-angular observations can be used as an additional information source for the retrieval of properties of an observed target surface. In this paper, we studied the potential of multi-angular reflectance data for the improvement of leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) estimation by numerical inversion of the PROSAIL model. The potential for improvement of LAI and LCC was evaluated for both measured data and simulated data. The measured data was collected on 19 July 2016 by a frame-camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over a potato field, where eight experimental plots of 30\u00d730m were designed with different fertilization levels. Dozens of viewing angles, covering the hemisphere up to around 30\u00b0 from nadir, were obtained by a large forward and sideways overlap of collected images. Simultaneously to the UAV flight, in situ measurements of LAI and LCC were performed. Inversion of the PROSAIL model was done based on nadir data and based on multi-angular data collected by the UAV. Inversion based on the multi-angular data performed slightly better than inversion based on nadir data, indicated by the decrease in RMSE from 0.70 to 0.65m2/m2 for the estimation of LAI, and from 17.35 to 17.29\u03bcg/cm2 for the estimation of LCC, when nadir data were used and when multi-angular data were used, respectively. In addition to inversions based on measured data, we simulated several datasets at different multi-angular configurations and compared the accuracy of the inversions of these datasets with the inversion based on data simulated at nadir position. In general, the results based on simulated (synthetic) data indicated that when more viewing angles, more well distributed viewing angles, and viewing angles up to larger zenith angles were available for inversion, the most accurate estimations were obtained. Interestingly, when using spectra simulated at multi-angular sampling configurations as were captured by the UAV platform (view zenith angles up to 30\u00b0), already a huge improvement could be obtained when compared to solely using spectra simulated at nadir position. The results of this study show that the estimation of LAI and LCC by numerical inversion of the PROSAIL model can be improved when multi-angular observations are introduced. However, for the potato crop, PROSAIL inversion for measured data only showed moderate accuracy and slight improvements.", "A simplified urban-extent algorithm to characterize surface urban heat islands on a global scale and examine vegetation control on their spatiotemporal variability ": "We develop a new algorithm, the simplified urban-extent (SUE) algorithm, to estimate the surface urban heat island (UHI) intensity at a global scale. We implement the SUE algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to calculate the UHI intensity for over 9500 urban clusters using over 15 years of data, making this one of the most comprehensive characterizations of the surface UHI to date. The results from this algorithm are validated against previous multi-city studies to demonstrate the suitability of the method. The dataset created is then filtered for elevation differentials and percentage of urban area and used to estimate the diurnal, monthly, and long-term variability in the surface UHI in different climate zones. The global mean surface UHI intensity is 0.85 \u00b0C during daytime and 0.55 \u00b0C at night. Cities in arid climate show distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns, with higher surface UHI during nighttime (compared to daytime) and two peaks throughout the year. The diurnal variability in surface UHI is highest for equatorial climate zone (0.88 \u00b0C) and lowest for arid zone (0.53 \u00b0C). The seasonality is highest in the snow climate zone and lowest for equatorial climate zone. While investigating the change in the surface UHI over a decade and a half, we find a consistent increase in the daytime surface UHI in the urban clusters of the warm temperate climate zone (0.04 \u00b0C/decade) and snow climate zone (0.05 \u00b0C/decade). Only arid climate zones show a statistically significant increase in the nighttime surface UHI intensity (0.03 \u00b0C/decade). Globally, the change is mainly seen during the daytime (0.03 \u00b0C/decade). Finally, the importance of vegetation differential between urban and rural areas on the spatiotemporal variability is examined. Vegetation has a strong control on the seasonal variability of the surface UHI and may also partly control the long-term variability. The complete UHI data are available through this website (https://yceo.yale.edu/research/global-surface-uhi-explorer) and allows the user to query the UHI of urban clusters using a simple interface.", "Measuring land-use and land-cover change using the U.S. department of agriculture\u2019s cropland data layer: Cautions and recommendations ": "Monitoring agricultural land is important for understanding and managing food production, environmental conservation efforts, and climate change. The United States Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL), an annual satellite imagery-derived land cover map, has been increasingly used for this application since complete coverage of the conterminous United States became available in 2008. However, the CDL is designed and produced with the intent of mapping annual land cover rather than tracking changes over time, and as a result certain precautions are needed in multi-year change analyses to minimize error and misapplication. We highlight scenarios that require special considerations, suggest solutions to key challenges, and propose a set of recommended good practices and general guidelines for CDL-based land change estimation. We also characterize a problematic issue of crop area underestimation bias within the CDL that needs to be accounted for and corrected when calculating changes to crop and cropland areas. When used appropriately and in conjunction with related information, the CDL is a valuable and effective tool for detecting diverse trends in agriculture. By explicitly discussing the methods and techniques for post-classification measurement of land-cover and land-use change using the CDL, we aim to further stimulate the discourse and continued development of suitable methodologies. Recommendations generated here are intended specifically for the CDL but may be broadly applicable to additional remotely-sensed land cover datasets including the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land cover products, and other regional, national, and global land cover classification maps.", "Urban heat island effect: A systematic review of spatio-temporal factors, data, methods, and mitigation measures ": "Despite research on urban heat island (UHI) effect has increased exponentially over the last few decades, a systematic review of factors contributing to UHI effect has scarcely been reported in the literature. This paper provides a systematic and overarching review of different spatial and temporal factors affecting the UHI effect. UHI is a phenomenon when urban areas experience a higher temperature than their surrounding non-urban areas and is considered as a critical factor contributing to global warming, heat related mortalities, and unpredictable climatic changes. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify the spatio-temporal factors that contribute to (or mitigate) the UHI effect in order to develop a thorough understanding of their causal mechanism so that these are addressed through urban planning policies. This paper systematically identified 75 eligible studies on UHI effect and reviews the nature and type of satellite images used, the techniques applied to classify land cover/use changes, the models to assess the link between spatio-temporal factors and UHI effect, and the effects of these factors on UHI. The review results show that: a) 54% of the studies used Landsat TM images for modelling the UHI effect followed by Landsat ETM (34%), and MODIS (28%); b) land cover indices (46%), followed by supervised classification (17%) were the dominant methods to derive land cover/use changes associated with UHI effect; c) ordinary least square regression is the most commonly applied method (68%) to investigate the link between different spatio-temporal factors and the UHI effect followed by comparative analysis (33%); and d) the most common factors affecting the UHI effect as reported in the reviewed studies, include vegetation cover (44%), season (33%), built-up area (28%), day/night (25%), population density (14%), water body (12%) together with others. This research discusses the findings in policy terms and provides directions for future research.", "Forest biomass retrieval approaches from earth observation in different biomes ": "The amount and spatial distribution of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) were estimated using a range of regionally developed methods using Earth Observation data for Poland, Sweden and regions in Indonesia (Kalimantan), Mexico (Central Mexico and Yucatan peninsula), and South Africa (Eastern provinces) for the year 2010. These regions are representative of numerous forest biomes and biomass levels globally, from South African woodlands and savannas to the humid tropical forest of Kalimantan. AGB retrieval in each region relied on different sources of reference data, including forest inventory plot data and airborne LiDAR observations, and used a range of retrieval algorithms. This is the widest inter-comparison of regional-to-national AGB maps to date in terms of area, forest types, input datasets, and retrieval methods. The accuracy assessment of all regional maps using independent field data or LiDAR AGB maps resulted in an overall root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 10 t ha\u22121 to 55\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121 (37% to 67% relative RMSE), and an overall bias ranging from \u22121 t ha\u22121 to +5 t ha\u22121 at pixel level. The regional maps showed better agreement with field data than previously developed and widely used pan-tropical or northern hemisphere datasets. The comparison of accuracy assessments showed commonalities in error structures despite the variety of methods, input data, and forest biomes. All regional retrievals resulted in overestimation (up to 63\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121) in the lower AGB classes, and underestimation (up to 85 t ha\u22121) in the higher AGB classes. Parametric model-based algorithms present advantages due to their low demand on in situ data compared to non-parametric algorithms, but there is a need for datasets and retrieval methods that can overcome the biases at both ends of the AGB range. The outcomes of this study should be considered when developing algorithms to estimate forest biomass at continental to global scale level.", "Using a U-net convolutional neural network to map woody vegetation extent from high resolution satellite imagery across Queensland, Australia ": "Convolutional neural networks offer a new approach to classifying high resolution imagery. We use the U-net neural network architecture to map the presence or absence of trees and large shrubs across the Australian state of Queensland. From a state-wide mosaic of 1\u202fm resolution 3-band Earth-i imagery, a selection of 827 squares (1\u202fkm2) are manually labeled for the presence of trees or large shrubs, and these are used to train the neural network. The training is intended to capture the textures which are primary visual cues of such vegetation. The trained neural network has an accuracy on independent data of around 90%. The resulting map over the whole of Queensland (1.73\u202fmillion\u202fkm2) is intended to be manually checked, and edited where necessary, to provide a high quality map of woody vegetation extent to serve a range of government policy objectives.", "Estimation of suspended sediment concentration in an intermittent river using multi-temporal high-resolution satellite imagery ": "There is a shortage of sediment-routing monitoring worldwide, despite its relevance to environmental processes. In drylands, where water resources are more vulnerable to the sediment dynamics, this flaw is even more harmful. In the semi-arid Caatinga biome in the North-east of Brazil, rivers are almost all intermittent and hydro-sedimentological monitoring is scarce. In the biome, water supply derives from thousands of surface reservoirs, whose water availability is liable to be reduced by siltation and sediment-related pollution. The goal of this research was to evaluate the potential of multi-temporal high-resolution satellite imagery (RapidEye) to assess the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the medium-sized intermittent Jaguaribe River, Brazil, during a 5-year period. We validated 15 one-, two- and three-band indices for SSC estimation based on RapidEye spectral bands deduced in the context of the present investigation and nine indices proposed in the literature for other optical sensors, by comparing them with in-situ concentration data. The in-situ SSC data ranged from 67 mg.L\u22121 to 230 mg.L\u22121. We concluded that RapidEye images can assess moderate SSC of intermittent rivers, even when their discharge is low. The RapidEye indices performed better than those from literature. The spectral band that best represented SSC was the near infrared, whose performance improved when associated with the green band. This conclusion agrees with literature findings for diverse sedimentological contexts. The three-band spectral indices performed worse than those with only one or two spectral bands, showing that the use of a third band did not enhance the model ability. Besides, we show that the hydrological characteristics of semi-arid intermittent rivers generate difficulties to monitor SSC using optical satellite remote sensing, such as time-concentrated sediment yield; and its association with recent rainfall events and, therefore, with cloudy sky.", "Estimating chlorophyll with thermal and broadband multispectral high resolution imagery from an unmanned aerial system using relevance vector machines for precision agriculture ": "Precision agriculture requires high-resolution information to enable greater precision in the management of inputs to production. Actionable information about crop and field status must be acquired at high spatial resolution and at a temporal frequency appropriate for timely responses. In this study, high spatial resolution imagery was obtained through the use of a small, unmanned aerial system called AggieAirTM. Simultaneously with the AggieAir flights, intensive ground sampling for plant chlorophyll was conducted at precisely determined locations. This study reports the application of a relevance vector machine coupled with cross validation and backward elimination to a dataset composed of reflectance from high-resolution multi-spectral imagery (VIS\u2013NIR), thermal infrared imagery, and vegetative indices, in conjunction with in situ SPAD measurements from which chlorophyll concentrations were derived, to estimate chlorophyll concentration from remotely sensed data at 15-cm resolution. The results indicate that a relevance vector machine with a thin plate spline kernel type and kernel width of 5.4, having LAI, NDVI, thermal and red bands as the selected set of inputs, can be used to spatially estimate chlorophyll concentration with a root-mean-squared-error of 5.31\u03bcgcm\u22122, efficiency of 0.76, and 9 relevance vectors.", "Monitoring the structure of forest restoration plantations with a drone-lidar system ": "We are in an unprecedented moment for promoting forest restoration globally, with international and regional pledges to restore at least 350\u2009million hectares by 2030. To achieve these ambitious goals, it is necessary to go beyond traditional plot-scale assessments and develop cost-effective technologies that can monitor the structure and function of restored forests at much broader scales. Lidar remote sensing in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms can be an agile and autonomous method for monitoring forest restoration projects, especially under conditions when information updates are frequently needed in relatively small areas or, when using an airplane-borne lidar system may be not financially viable. Here, we explored the potential of an UAV-borne lidar system to assess the outcomes of a mixed-species restoration plantation experiment, designed to maximize aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation. The experiment was established in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest, with 20 native tree species, by combining two levels of planting density and two management levels, totaling four treatment combinations and one control (plots left over for natural regeneration). We analyzed three structural variables from lidar data (canopy height, gap fraction and leaf area index) and one from field inventory data (AGB). Structural differences between the treatments and the control plots were reliably distinguished by the UAV-borne lidar system. AGB was strongly correlated with canopy height, allowing us to elaborate a predictive equation to use the UAV-borne lidar system for monitoring structural features in other restoration plantations in the region. UAV-borne lidar systems showed enormous potential for monitoring relatively broad-scale (thousands of hectares) forest restoration projects, providing an important tool to aid decision making and accountability in forest landscape restoration.", "Optimal dates for assessing long-term changes in tree-cover in the semi-arid biomes of South Africa using MODIS NDVI time series (2001\u20132018) ": "The varying proportions of tree and herbaceous cover in the grassland and savanna biomes of Southern Africa determine their capacity to provide ecosystem services. The asynchronous phenologies e.g. annual NDVI profiles of grasses and trees in these semi-arid landscapes provide an opportunity to estimate percentage tree-cover by determining the period of maximum contrast between grasses and trees. First, a 16-day NDVI time series was generated from MODIS NDVI data, i.e. MOD13A2 16-day NDVI composite data. Secondly, percentage tree-cover data for 100 sample polygons (4\u2009\u00d7\u20094) pixels for areas that have not undergone change in tree cover between 2001 and 2018 were derived using high resolution Google Earth imagery. Next, a time series consisting of the coefficients of determination (R2) for the NDVI/tree-cover linear regression were computed for the 100 polygons. Lastly, a threshold R2 > 0.5 was used to determine the optimal period of the year for mapping tree-cover. It emerged that the narrow period from Julian day 161\u2013177 (June 10\u201326) was the most consistent period with R2 > 0.5 in the region. 18 tree-cover maps (2001\u20132018) were generated using linear regression model coefficients derived from Julian day 161 for each year. Kendall correlation coefficient (tau) was used to determine areas of significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05 and p\u2009<\u20090.01) increasing or decreasing trend in tree-cover. Areas (polygons) that showed increasing tree-cover appeared to be more widespread in the trend map as compared to areas of decreasing tree-cover. An accuracy assessment of the map of increasing tree-cover was conducted using Google Earth high resolution images. Out of 330 and 200 mapped polygons verified using p\u2009<\u2009 0.05 and 0.01 thresholds, respectively, 180 (54% accuracy) and 132 (65% accuracy) showed evidence of tree recruitment. Farm abandonment appeared to have been the most important factor contributing to increasing tree-cover in the region.", "Geospatial analysis of land use change in the Savannah River Basin using Google Earth Engine ": "Climate and land use/cover change are among the most pervasive issues facing the Southeastern United States, including the Savannah River basin in South Carolina and Georgia. Land use directly affects the natural environment across the Savannah River basin and it is important to analyze these impacts. The objectives of this study are to: 1) determine the classes and the distribution of land cover in the Savannah River basin; 2) identify the spatial and the temporal change of the land cover that occurs as a consequence of land use change in the area; and 3) discuss the potential effects of land use change in the Savannah River basin. The land cover maps were produced using random forest supervised classification at four time periods for a total of thirteen common land cover classes with overall accuracy assessments of 79.18% (1999), 79.41% (2005), 76.04% (2009), and 76.11% (2015). The major land use change observed was due to the deforestation and reforestation of forest areas during the entire study period. The change detection results using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) indicated that the proportion areas of the deforestation were 5.93% (1999\u20132005), 4.63% (2005\u20132009), and 3.76% (2009\u20132015), while the proportion areas of the reforestation were 1.57% (1999\u20132005), 0.44% (2005\u20132009), and 1.53% (2009\u20132015). These results not only indicate land use change, but also demonstrate the advantage of utilizing Google Earth Engine and the public archive database in its platform to track and monitor this change over time.", "Evaluation of forest cover estimates for Haiti using supervised classification of Landsat data ": "This study uses 2010\u20132011 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to estimate total forested area in Haiti. The thematic map was generated using radiometric normalization of digital numbers by a modified normalization method utilizing pseudo-invariant polygons (PIPs), followed by supervised classification of the mosaicked image using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations Land Cover Classification System. Classification results were compared to other sources of land-cover data produced for similar years, with an emphasis on the statistics presented by the FAO. Three global land cover datasets (GLC2000, Globcover, 2009, and MODIS MCD12Q1), and a national-scale dataset (a land cover analysis by Haitian National Centre for Geospatial Information (CNIGS)) were reclassified and compared. According to our classification, approximately 32.3% of Haiti's total land area was tree covered in 2010\u20132011. This result was confirmed using an error-adjusted area estimator, which predicted a tree covered area of 32.4%. Standardization to the FAO's forest cover class definition reduces the amount of tree cover of our supervised classification to 29.4%. This result was greater than the reported FAO value of 4% and the value for the recoded GLC2000 dataset of 7.0%, but is comparable to values for three other recoded datasets: MCD12Q1 (21.1%), Globcover (2009) (26.9%), and CNIGS (19.5%). We propose that at coarse resolutions, the segmented and patchy nature of Haiti's forests resulted in a systematic underestimation of the extent of forest cover. It appears the best explanation for the significant difference between our results, FAO statistics, and compared datasets is the accuracy of the data sources and the resolution of the imagery used for land cover analyses. Analysis of recoded global datasets and results from this study suggest a strong linear relationship (R\n                     2\n                     =0.996 for tree cover) between spatial resolution and land cover estimates.", "Remote monitoring to predict bridge scour failure using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) stacking techniques ": "Scour is the removal of ground material in water bodies due to environmental changes in water flow. It particularly occurs at bridge piers and the holes formed can make bridges susceptible to collapse. The most common cause of bridge collapse is due to scour occurring during flooding, some failures causing loss of life and most resulting in significant transport disruption and economic loss. Consequently, failure of bridges due to scour is of great concern to bridge asset owners, and is currently very difficult to predict since conventional assessment methods foresee very resource-demanding monitoring efforts in situ. This paper presents evidence of how InSAR techniques can be used to monitor bridges at risk of scour, using Tadcaster Bridge, England, as a case study. Tadcaster Bridge suffered a partial collapse due to river scour on the evening of December 29th, 2015 following a period of severe rainfall and flooding. 48 TerraSAR-X scenes over the bridge from the two-year period prior to the collapse are analysed using the small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) approach. The study highlights a distinct movement in the region of the bridge where the collapse occurred prior to the actual event. This precursor to failure observed in the data over a month before actual collapse suggests the possible use of InSAR as a means of an early warning system in structural health monitoring of bridges at risk of scour.", "Combining UAV-based plant height from crop surface models, visible, and near infrared vegetation indices for biomass monitoring in barley ": "In this study we combined selected vegetation indices (VIs) and plant height information to estimate biomass in a summer barley experiment. The VIs were calculated from ground-based hyperspectral data and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based red green blue (RGB) imaging. In addition, the plant height information was obtained from UAV-based multi-temporal crop surface models (CSMs). The test site is a summer barley experiment comprising 18 cultivars and two nitrogen treatments located in Western Germany. We calculated five VIs from hyperspectral data. The normalised ratio index (NRI)-based index GnyLi (Gnyp et al., 2014) showed the highest correlation (R\n                     2\n                     =0.83) with dry biomass. In addition, we calculated three visible band VIs: the green red vegetation index (GRVI), the modified GRVI (MGRVI) and the red green blue VI (RGBVI), where the MGRVI and the RGBVI are newly developed VI. We found that the visible band VIs have potential for biomass prediction prior to heading stage. A robust estimate for biomass was obtained from the plant height models (R\n                     2\n                     =0.80\u20130.82). In a cross validation test, we compared plant height, selected VIs and their combination with plant height information. Combining VIs and plant height information by using multiple linear regression or multiple non-linear regression models performed better than the VIs alone. The visible band GRVI and the newly developed RGBVI are promising but need further investigation. However, the relationship between plant height and biomass produced the most robust results. In summary, the results indicate that plant height is competitive with VIs for biomass estimation in summer barley. Moreover, visible band VIs might be a useful addition to biomass estimation. The main limitation is that the visible band VIs work for early growing stages only.", "Multi- and hyperspectral geologic remote sensing: A review ": "Geologists have used remote sensing data since the advent of the technology for regional mapping, structural interpretation and to aid in prospecting for ores and hydrocarbons. This paper provides a review of multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data, products and applications in geology. During the early days of Landsat Multispectral scanner and Thematic Mapper, geologists developed band ratio techniques and selective principal component analysis to produce iron oxide and hydroxyl images that could be related to hydrothermal alteration. The advent of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) with six channels in the shortwave infrared and five channels in the thermal region allowed to produce qualitative surface mineral maps of clay minerals (kaolinite, illite), sulfate minerals (alunite), carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite), iron oxides (hematite, goethite), and silica (quartz) which allowed to map alteration facies (propylitic, argillic etc.). The step toward quantitative and validated (subpixel) surface mineralogic mapping was made with the advent of high spectral resolution hyperspectral remote sensing. This led to a wealth of techniques to match image pixel spectra to library and field spectra and to unravel mixed pixel spectra to pure endmember spectra to derive subpixel surface compositional information. These products have found their way to the mining industry and are to a lesser extent taken up by the oil and gas sector. The main threat for geologic remote sensing lies in the lack of (satellite) data continuity. There is however a unique opportunity to develop standardized protocols leading to validated and reproducible products from satellite remote sensing for the geology community. By focusing on geologic mapping products such as mineral and lithologic maps, geochemistry, P-T paths, fluid pathways etc. the geologic remote sensing community can bridge the gap with the geosciences community. Increasingly workflows should be multidisciplinary and remote sensing data should be integrated with field observations and subsurface geophysical data to monitor and understand geologic processes.", "Predicting damage production in monoatomic and multi-elemental targets using stopping and range of ions in matter code: Challenges and recommendations ": "The computer code, Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM), is widely used to describe energetic processes of ion-solid interactions; its predictive power relies on the accuracy of energy loss/transfer and collision processes being considered. While the SRIM code is commonly applied in radiation effects research to predict damage production and in the semiconductor industry to estimate ion range and dopant concentration profiles, two challenges exist that affect its use: (1) inconsistency in estimations of atomic displacements between full-cascade and quick (modified Kinchin\u2013Pease) options and (2) overestimation of electronic stopping power for slow heavy ions in light targets (e.g., Be and Si) or in compound targets containing light elements (e.g., C, N and O in carbides, nitrides and oxides). Based on a literature review and our experimental investigations, we discuss the underlying reasons for the discrepancies, clarify the physical limitations of the SRIM predictions, and, more importantly, provide recommendations to address the two challenges.", "Overview of the synthesis of MXenes and other ultrathin 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides ": "In 2011, a new family of two dimensional (2D) carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides \u2013 labeled MXenes \u2013 was discovered. Since then the number of papers on these materials has increased exponentially for several reasons amongst them: their hydrophilic nature, excellent electronic conductivities and ease of synthesizing large quantities in water. This unique combination of properties and ease of processing has positioned them as enabling materials for a large, and quite varied, host of applications from energy storage to electromagnetic shielding, transparent conductive electrodes, electrocatalysis, to name a few. Since the initial synthesis of Ti3C2 in hydrofluoric acid, many more compositions were discovered, and different synthesis pathways were explored. Most of the work done so far has been conducted on top-down synthesis where a layered parent compound is etched and then exfoliated. Three bottom-up synthesis methods, chemical vapor deposition, a template method and plasma enhanced pulsed laser deposition have been reported. The latter methods enable the synthesis of not only high-quality ultrathin 2D transition metal carbide and nitride films, but also those that could not be synthesized by selective etching. This article reviews and summarizes the most important breakthroughs in the synthesis of MXenes and high-quality ultrathin 2D transition metal carbide and nitride films.", "Recent advances in MXenes: From fundamentals to applications ": "The family of MAX phases and their derivative MXenes are continuously growing in terms of both crystalline and composition varieties. In the last couple of years, several breakthroughs have been achieved that boosted the synthesis of novel MAX phases with ordered double transition metals and, consequently, the synthesis of novel MXenes with a higher chemical diversity and structural complexity, rarely seen in other families of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Considering the various elemental composition possibilities, surface functional tunability, various magnetic orders, and large spin\u2013orbit coupling, MXenes can truly be considered as multifunctional materials that can be used to realize highly correlated phenomena. In addition, owing to their large surface area, hydrophilicity, adsorption ability, and high surface reactivity, MXenes have attracted attention for many applications, e.g., catalysts, ion batteries, gas storage media, and sensors. Given the fast progress of MXene-based science and technology, it is timely to update our current knowledge on various properties and possible applications. Since many theoretical predictions remain to be experimentally proven, here we mainly emphasize the physics and chemistry that can be observed in MXenes and discuss how these properties can be tuned or used for different applications.", "Sodium and sodium-ion energy storage batteries ": "Owing to almost unmatched volumetric energy density, Li-ion batteries have dominated the portable electronics industry and solid state electrochemical literature for the past 20years. Not only will that continue, but they are also now powering plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles. In light of possible concerns over rising lithium costs in the future, Na and Na-ion batteries have re-emerged as candidates for medium and large-scale stationary energy storage, especially as a result of heightened interest in renewable energy sources that provide intermittent power which needs to be load-levelled. The sodium-ion battery field presents many solid state materials design challenges, and rising to that call in the past couple of years, several reports of new sodium-ion technologies and electrode materials have surfaced. These range from high-temperature air electrodes to new layered oxides, polyanion-based materials, carbons and other insertion materials for sodium-ion batteries, many of which hold promise for future sodium-based energy storage applications.

Nanobeams combined with diffraction have made it possible to image parameters that were traditionally only addressed as ensemble averages. This enables the study of highly heterogeneous materials such as microelectronic devices and opens a new field of material science on the mesoscale. Coherent nanobeams offer the opportunity to image nanomaterials in three dimensions with a resolution far smaller than the focused beam size. This has opened up new fields in X-ray diffraction in general and has become one of the main drivers for the enhancement of existing, and the construction of new, large scale scientific infrastructure projects around the world.", "High manganese austenitic twinning induced plasticity steels: A review of the microstructure properties relationships ": "A significant increase in the research activity dedicated to high manganese TWIP steels has occurred during the past five years, motivated by the breakthrough combination of strength and ductility possessed by these alloys.

Recently, several academic results have been reported concerning flexible and stretchable strain sensors. These reports indicate that the materials and design methods have an important influence on the performance of strain sensors. Carbon-based nanomaterials including carbon-based nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and carbon black nanoparticles play a key role in the fabrication of flexible strain sensors with excellent properties. In terms of design, carbon-based nanomaterials are generally combined with polymers to maintain the flexibility and stability of a strain sensor. Various combined methods were successfully developed using different assembly structures of carbon-based nanomaterials in polymers, such as uniform mixing and ordered structures, including films, fibers, nanofiber membranes, yarns, foams, and fabrics. The working mechanisms of the flexible strain sensors, including changing the conductive network between overlapped nanomaterials, tunneling effect, and crack propagation, are also different compared with that of traditional semiconductor and metal sensors. The effects of the carbon-based nanomaterial structures in polymers on the strain sensing performance have been comprehensively studied and analyzed. The potential applications of flexible strain sensors and current challenges have been summarized and evaluated. This review provides some suggestions for further development of flexible and stretchable strain sensors with outstanding performance.", "Chemical effects on He bubble superlattice formation in high entropy alloys ": "The probable formation mechanism of He bubble superlattices relies on long range anisotropic diffusion of self-interstitial atoms (SIAs). Here we study He ion irradiation of pure Ni and two equiatomic concentrated solid-solution alloys (CSAs) of FeNi and FeCrNiCo. It is expected from the significantly reduced diffusion of SIAs in CSAs, including high entropy alloys (HEAs), that long range anisotropic SIA migration cannot be active. We report the formation of a He bubble lattice in pure Ni, and for the first time in FeNi and FeCrNiCo systems under 30\u202fkeV He ion irradiation at room temperature. The ion dose and flux required to form a bubble superlattice increase with chemical complexity. Comparing to Ni, SIA clusters change directions more frequently due to anisotropic elementally-biased diffusion from the higher degree of chemical non-homogeneity in CSAs. Nevertheless, anisotropic 1-D diffusion of interstitial defects is possible in these complex alloys over incrementally longer time scales and irradiation doses. The sluggish diffusion, characteristic in CSAs, leads to smaller superlattice parameters and smaller bubble diameters. The chemical biased SIA diffusion and its effects on He evolution revealed here have important implications on understanding and improving radiation tolerance over a wide range of extreme conditions.", "Grain boundary segregation engineering in metallic alloys: A pathway to the design of interfaces ": "Grain boundaries influence mechanical, functional, and kinetic properties of metallic alloys. They can be manipulated via solute decoration enabling changes in energy, mobility, structure, and cohesion or even promoting local phase transformation. In the approach which we refer here to as \u2018segregation engineering\u2019 solute decoration is not regarded as an undesired phenomenon but is instead utilized to manipulate specific grain boundary structures, compositions and properties that enable useful material behavior. The underlying thermodynamics follow the adsorption isotherm. Hence, matrix-solute combinations suited for designing interfaces in metallic alloys can be identified by considering four main aspects, namely, the segregation coefficient of the decorating element; its effects on interface cohesion, energy, structure and mobility; its diffusion coefficient; and the free energies of competing bulk phases, precipitate phases or complexions. From a practical perspective, segregation engineering in alloys can be usually realized by a modest diffusion heat treatment, hence, making it available in large scale manufacturing.", "Atomistic calculations and materials informatics: A review ": "In recent years, there has been a large effort in the materials science community to employ materials informatics to accelerate materials discovery or to develop new understanding of materials behavior. Materials informatics methods utilize machine learning techniques to extract new knowledge or predictive models out of existing materials data. In this review, we discuss major advances in the intersection between data science and atom-scale calculations with a particular focus on studies of solid-state, inorganic materials. The examples discussed in this review cover methods for accelerating the calculation of computationally-expensive properties, identifying promising regions for materials discovery based on existing data, and extracting chemical intuition automatically from datasets. We also identify key issues in this field, such as limited distribution of software necessary to utilize these techniques, and opportunities for areas of research that would help lead to the wider adoption of materials informatics in the atomistic calculations community.", "Measurement of fracture toughness by nanoindentation methods: Recent advances and future challenges ": "In this paper, we describe recent advances and developments for the measurement of fracture toughness at small scales by the use of nanoindentation-based methods including techniques based on micro-cantilever, beam bending and micro-pillar splitting. A critical comparison of the techniques is made by testing a selected group of bulk and thin film materials. For pillar splitting, cohesive zone finite element simulations are used to validate a simple relationship between the critical load at failure, the pillar radius, and the fracture toughness for a range of material properties and coating/substrate combinations. The minimum pillar diameter required for nucleation and growth of a crack during indentation is also estimated. An analysis of pillar splitting for a film on a dissimilar substrate material shows that the critical load for splitting is relatively insensitive to the substrate compliance for a large range of material properties. Experimental results from a selected group of materials show good agreement between single cantilever and pillar splitting methods, while a discrepancy of \u223c25% is found between the pillar splitting technique and double-cantilever testing. It is concluded that both the micro-cantilever and pillar splitting techniques are valuable methods for micro-scale assessment of fracture toughness of brittle ceramics, provided the underlying assumptions can be validated. Although the pillar splitting method has some advantages because of the simplicity of sample preparation and testing, it is not applicable to most metals because their higher toughness prevents splitting, and in this case, micro-cantilever bend testing is preferred.", "Degradable biomaterials based on magnesium corrosion ": "Biodegradable metals are breaking the current paradigm in biomaterial science to develop only corrosion resistant metals. In particular, metals which consist of trace elements existing in the human body are promising candidates for temporary implant materials.

In this investigative review we would like to summarize the latest achievements and comment on the selection and use, test methods and the approaches to develop and produce magnesium alloys that are intended to perform clinically with an appropriate host response.", "Fundamental deformation behavior in high-entropy alloys: An overview ": "High-entropy alloys (HEAs), as a new class of materials, are nearly equiatomic and multi-element systems, which can crystallize asa single phase or multi-phases. Most of the HEAs described in the literature contain multiple phases (secondary phases, nanoparticles, and so on), rather than a single solid-solution phase. Thus, it is essential to review the typical mechanical properties of both single-phase and multiphase HEAs thoroughly, with emphases on (1) the fundamental physical mechanisms and (2) the difference from conventional alloys. In this paper, mainly based on different mechanical properties, HEAs are classified into four types for the first time, i.e., (a) HEA alloy systems of 3d-transition metals only (Type 1), (b) HEA alloy systems of transition metals with larger atomic-radius elements (Type 2), (c) HEA alloy systems of refractory metals (Type 3), and (4) others (Type 4). Then a number of aspects of mechanical behavior are reviewed and discussed, including the elastic anisotropy, yield strength, high-temperature performance, serration behavior, fracture toughness, and fatigue responses, which may serve as a demonstrative summary for the current progress in the scientific research of HEAs. Several mechanisms that quantitatively explain the mechanical properties of single-phase and multiphase HEAs in terms of basic defects (dislocations, twinning, precipitates, etc.) are discussed. A number of future research activities are suggested, based on the emphasis on developing high-performance structural materials. The review concludes with a brief summary of major mechanical properties and insights into the deformation behavior of single-phase and multiphase HEAs. The comparison and contrast between HEAs and conventional alloys remain the most compelling motivation for future studies. With the integrated experimental and simulation investigations, a clearer picture of the fundamental deformation behavior of single-phase and multiphase HEAs could be explored.", "Powder bed binder jet 3D printing of Inconel 718: Densification, microstructural evolution and challenges\u2606 ": "Traditional manufacturing of Inconel 718 components from castings and thermomechanical processing routes involve extensive post processing and machining to attain the desired geometry. Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies including direct energy deposition (DED), selective laser melting (SLM), electron beam melting (EBM) and binder jet 3D printing (BJ3DP) can minimize scrap generation and reduce lead times. While there is extensive literature on the use of melting and solidification based AM technologies, there has been limited research on the use of binder jet 3D printing. In this paper, a brief review on binder jet additive manufacturing of Inconel 718 is presented. In addition, existing knowledge on sintering of Inconel 718 has been extended to binder jet 3D printing. We found that supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS) is necessary to achieve full densification of Inconel 718. SLPS is sensitive to the feedstock chemistry that has a strong influence on the liquid volume fraction at the processing temperature. Based on these results, we discuss an empirical framework to determine the role of powder particle size and liquid volume fraction on sintering kinetics. The role of powder packing factor and binder saturation on microstructural evolution is discussed. The current challenges in the use of BJ3DP for fabrication of Inconel 718, as well as, extension to other metal systems, are presented.", "A review of corrosion inhibitors for rust preventative fluids ": "Corrosion of metals has been a widespread issue in industries for centuries.

In situ TEM experiments and atomistic simulations each have their own unique limitations, including observable length and time scales and accessibility of information, motivating approaches that combine the two approaches. In this paper, we review recent studies that combine atomistic simulations and in situ TEM experiments to understand defect mechanisms associated with deformation of metals and alloys.

Among them, responsive soft material-involved photonic structures uniquely feature large volumetric changes upon external stimuli. The volumetric changes result in peak/valley shift of reflection spectra and perceptible color changes, providing responsive soft material-based structural color systems capability of serving as sensors for detecting chemical and biological analytes. Synthetic polymers and some natural materials are the most studied and utilized responsive soft materials for constructing structural color sensors, by tuning the thickness and morphology of formed films, or incorporating them into template structures, or their self-assembling. In this review article, structural colors in nature are firstly introduced, followed by discussing recent developments of promising responsive soft material-based structural color sensors, including the design of structural color sensors based on synthetic polymers and natural materials, as well as their applications for chemical sensing, biosensing, and multi-analyte sensing with sensor arrays. For specific sensing of chemicals and biomolecules, the sensing performance is evaluated in terms of detection range, sensitivity, response time, and selectivity.

Potential topics of oncoming focus are highlighted.", "Thermodynamic costs of dynamic function in active soft matter ": "Living matter combines complex structures and dissipative processes to achieve dynamic functions that rely on material organization in space and time. In this Review, we discuss recent progress in creating synthetic material systems capable of four such functions\u2013keeping time, powering motion, building structures, and making copies. Chemical oscillators coordinate the temporal activity of material assemblies; molecular motors and active colloids convert chemical energy into mechanical forces and motions; chemical activation of self-assembling components provides temporal control over dissipative structures; information-rich nanomaterials replicate their structures in exponential fashion. These and other dynamic functions cannot be achieved at thermodynamic equilibrium but instead require flows of energy and matter to create and maintain spatiotemporal order. Such systems are captured within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, which describes the fluctuating thermodynamic quantities of driven systems. Even far from equilibrium, these quantities obey universal relations, which establish fundamental trade-offs between the rate of energy dissipation and performance metrics such as precision, efficiency, and speed. For each function considered, we present a simple kinetic model that offers general insights that inform the design and creation of dissipative material systems capable of dynamic functions. Overall, we aim to bridge experimental efforts in active soft matter and theoretical advances from stochastic thermodynamics to inform future research on material systems inspired by living matter.", "Impact assessment of vehicular exhaust emissions by microscale simulation using automatic traffic flow measurements ": "In order to assess the impact of traffic on local air quality a microscale simulation of pollutant concentration fields was produced for two busy intersections, in Reggio Emilia and in Modena, Italy. The simulation was performed by the model suite Micro-Swift-Spray, a Lagrangian particle dispersion model accounting for buildings. Direct measurements of traffic flow were continuously collected in Reggio Emilia over the period January 13\u201324, 2014 by a two channel radar traffic counter and in Modena from October 28 to November 8, 2016 by four single channel radar traffic counters and used for the hourly modulation of vehicular emissions. Combining radar counts with vehicular fleet composition for each municipality, specific emission factors were obtained. For both cities, simulated concentration fields were compared to local air quality measurements at the nearest urban traffic and urban background sites. The simulated NOx showed large correlation with the observations, notwithstanding some underestimation. The results proved the reliability of the procedure and provided a fair estimate of the NO2 mass fraction of total NOx (primary NO2) due to vehicular emissions in the investigated traffic sites.", "Exploring the spatial effect of urbanization on multi-sectoral CO2 emissions in China ": "Rapid urbanization has increased the demand for energy in various sectors. Previous studies have focused more on individual sectors when investigating the spatial impact of urbanization on CO2, but few have compared the differences among sectors. This study uses geographically weighted regression model to investigate the effect of urbanization on CO2 emissions in six sectors in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Industrial structure and energy intensity were selected as control variables in this study. The results indicate that the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and water conservancy sector declines from the southeastern coastal area to the northwest. The influence of urbanization on CO2 emissions presents an increasing trend from the northeast region to the southwest region in the construction industry sector. In industry and residential consumption sectors, urbanization had a greater impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region than in the western region. However, urbanization had a stronger impact on CO2 emissions in the western region than in the eastern region in the transportation, storage, and postal industry sector. As for wholesale and retail trade and catering and accommodation industry sector, the effect of urbanization on CO2 emissions in the southern region was larger than in the northern region. To achieve the goal of ultimately reducing carbon emissions, policymakers should formulate differential policy for different sectors in different regions, optimize the industrial structure, and develop high technology.", "Field measurements on particle size distributions and emission characteristics of PM10 in a cement plant of China ": "The particle size distributions (PSDs) and the characteristics of the particulate matter (PM) from cement plants are of importance for the air pollution control strategies. The study focuses on the PSDs and emission characteristics of PM10 in the flue gas from the preheater and in the hot air out from the clinker cooler in a cement plant equipped with a conditioning tower, two raw mills, a gravity settler and two fabric filters. A Dekati low pressure impactor (DLPI) with a cyclone was performed to sample the PM10 at the inlet/outlet of the above devices. The PM10 at the outlet of SP boiler and at the inlet of the gravity settler both present a bi-modal distribution, with a fine mode at 0.1\u20130.4\u202f\u03bcm and a coarse mode at 1.0\u20135.0\u202f\u03bcm. The PM10 emitted from the flue gas and the hot air into the atmosphere both present a tri-modal distribution, with a fine mode at 0.2\u20130.5/0.06\u20130.2\u202f\u03bcm, a middle mode at 0.5\u20132.5/0.2\u20130.6\u202f\u03bcm and a coarse mode at 5.0\u201310.0/3.0\u20136.0\u202f\u03bcm. The mass concentration of PM2.5 increases by 17.74% at the outlet of the raw mill due to the mechanical fragmentation and flow transport. The spraying and cooling of the conditioning tower promote the agglomeration and growth of fine particulates, and reduce the concentration proportion of PM2.5 to PM10 from 89.40 to 70.93%. The emission factors of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 in the flue gas are 0.017\u20130.031, 0.005\u20130.015 and 0.002\u20130.007\u202fkg/t, respectively; while they are 0.005, 0.003 and 0.001 in the hot air, respectively.", "Aerosol optical depth retrieval over the city of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) using Landsat-8 OLI images ": "Atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) products based on orbiting satellites such the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Aerosol Smoke Products (GASP) can provide global and regional daily AOD distributions. Their application to air quality monitoring at local scales such as urban environments is rather limited due to their coarse spatial resolution. Recently, there has been a growing interest in retrieving AOD products based on high resolution optical imagery. The primary objectives of this research study are to assess AOD retrieval over urban city areas using high spatial resolution satellite imagery. With the assumption of Lambertian surface, the principle of AOD retrieval developed is based on the radiative transfer theory using Tanr\u00e9 Equation. To solve the radiative transfer equation, the study adopted the radiative transfer model Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) and constructed a Look-Up-Table (LUT) assuming a continental aerosol model. The land surface reflectance (LSR) over the entire study period using Landsat 8 OLI for the period 2016\u20132017 showed very little variability. The retrieval of AOD is performed by comparing measured and simulated TOA reflectance. The validation is performed using an AERONET Masdar Institute ground based site located within the study area and the 10\u202fkm resolution MODIS Collection (C6) Deep Blue AOD (MOD04) products. The validation shows that AOD retrieval approach yields a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.04, a good correlation with an R2 equivalent to 67% and that the 58% of the retrieved values fall within the expected error (EE). Also, results show that Landsat-OLI retrieval are better and less biased as compared to MOD04 AOD products and that the used approach can provide much more details compared to the 10\u202fkm Deep Blue MODIS AOD products.", "Performance assessment of CHIMERE and EURAD-IM\u2019 dust modules ": "The purpose of this study is to investigate how two different atmospheric 3D modelling systems, with different dust modules, simulate a Saharan dust episode, using satellite data and in-situ observations to validate their performances. The episode occurred during 19\u201323 February 2016 and impacted the Iberian Peninsula. The two numerical modelling systems applied are the CHIMERE and the EURAD-IM chemistry transport models with different dust modules, both forced by the same WRF meteorological input. A common domain and resolution (27\u202f\u00d7\u202f27\u202fkm2) was adopted for the modelling setup. The comparison and evaluation of the two modelling results have shown that both models are able to capture the occurrence of the natural event, which was initiated by a cut-off low above the coast of Morocco, inducing a strong meridional transport of dust loaded air from Algeria straight towards eastern parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The most notable differences between the two model outputs concern the emission strengths and the emission source regions. In fact, different emission patterns and strengths are simulated by each model despite they use the same soil database, identical clay/silt/sand contribution for each soil type, and the same meteorological simulation. In general, CHIMERE simulates higher PM10, PM2.5, and dust concentrations than EURAD-IM for this event. In the South of Portugal, CHIMERE shows better agreement with observations, while in Central Portugal, EURAD-IM is closer to particle related measurements.", "Assessment of cyclists\u2019 exposure to ultrafine particles along alternative commuting routes in Edinburgh ": "An effective promotion of commuting by bicycle requires a set of complementary actions, with one of the key measures being the definition of bike-friendly routes, both in terms of road safety and exposure to air pollution. In this study, bike commuters\u2019 exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP) was assessed using mobile measurements and video recording along three alternative routes from central Edinburgh to the science and engineering campus of the University of Edinburgh. Results indicate significant differences in UFP exposure across the three alternative routes, with mean particle number counts (PNC) of 7,990, 9,824 and 19,310 particles/cm3 respectively. With respect to the different types of bike infrastructure present along routes, the findings suggest that bicycle boxes (spaces at intersections that allow cyclists to position themselves ahead of vehicle traffic) are effective for reducing UFP exposure and that using shared bus-bike lanes should be avoided where possible. Heavy duty vehicles (i.e. buses and trucks) and construction sites were identified as the main sources of peaks in UFP exposure. All routes in the city of Edinburgh showed markedly lower PNC levels than those reported by studies conducted in other cities. The findings of this study can inform the implementation of bike-sharing schemes and the design of future cycling infrastructure, for example in the context of developing the low emission zone proposed for implementation across Edinburgh for 2020.", "Introduction to liquid crystals ": "This pedagogical overview of liquid crystals is based on lectures for postgraduate students given at the International Max Planck Research School \u201cModeling of Soft Matter\u201d.

Wrong use of equilibrium constant in the Van't Hoof equation for calculation of thermodynamic parameters of adsorption ": "In the adsorption literature, the Van't Hoff equation is used in different manners without any criteria about the concepts of physical-chemistry of equilibrium for calculation of thermodynamic parameters of adsorption. Indeed, the equilibrium constant (K) should be dimensionless for being used in the Van't Hoff equation. However, this is not a simple adjustment of units, as being spread in the literature, to become K dimensionless. In this paper, it will be calculated the equilibrium constants using numeric examples and show the flaws of the thermodynamics calculations, when the value of K is wrongly calculated, and what are the expected results of the changes in enthalpy (\u0394H\u00b0) and changes in the entropy (\u0394S\u00b0) that are spread in the literature.", "A review on heavy metal pollution, toxicity and remedial measures: Current trends and future perspectives ": "Water is an exceptionally essential source for the presence of life on the earth. The water quality has seriously affected because of the overgrowth of the population, human activities, fast industrialization, unskilled utilization of natural water resources and unplanned urbanization. Heavy metal is a group of metal and metalloids with an atomic density higher than the 4000kg/m3. The heavy metals are toxic in nature which causes serious health illness to human beings and animals, even at very low concentration. These heavy metals enter into the aquatic system through the agricultural runoff and industrial discharges. Different treatment methods are available to remove the heavy metals from the aquatic environment with a different degree of success. In any case, the deficiencies of a large portion of these treatment methods are due to the production of secondary waste, high cost for operation and maintenance etc. Hence, it is important to develop robust, eco-friendly and economically viable treatment methods for the removal of heavy metals from the aquatic system and to safeguard the environment. In this review article, definite data on the source and their belongings of substantial metal contamination to the plants, individuals and other living life forms have been clarified. The distinctive sorts of treatment strategies for the removal of the toxic metals from wastewater had been explained. The numerous types of low-cost adsorbents utilized by different researchers/scientists for removal of heavy metals from wastewater have been discussed in detail.

The sludge and rice husk with ratio of 1:1 were pyrolyzed at 500\u202f\u00b0C, for 2\u202fh in a tubular furnace. The SRHB was characterized using an element analyzer, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results of the adsorption experiments revealed that the adsorption capacities of these dyes on the SRHB followed the order: Direct Red 4BS (DR)\u202f>\u202fAcid Orange II (AO)\u202f>\u202fReact Blue 19 (RB)\u202f>\u202fMethylene Blue (MB). Adsorption data of DR, RB, AO, MB all fitted both the Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm well, Temkin and D-R isotherm models verified the result. Kinetic data of the four dyes showed good correlation with the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption of DR and AO onto SRHB were exothermic, while that of RB and MB were endothermic. Dyestuffs sorption on the SRHB involved surface participation, electrostatic interaction, \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, hydrogen bond. However the main adsorption mechanisms of the different dyes onto the SRHB varied. Therefore, the SRHB could be an effective adsorbent for removing dyestuffs from wastewater, and it is most effectively for direct dye adsorption, followed by acid and reactive dyes. However, the SRHB was apparently not effective for cationic dyes.", "A review on heavy metal ions adsorption from water by graphene oxide and its composites ": "Graphene oxide (GO) and its composites have attracted widespread attentions as novel adsorbents for the adsorption of various heavy metal contaminants.

Most studies have focused on oxidation processes in the presence of Fe0 and radicals derived from oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ozone (O3), peroxysulfate (SO5\n                     2\u2212), peroxodisulfate (S2O8\n                     2\u2212), and oxygen (O2). Most of the results have shown that high percentages of pharmaceuticals can be removed, degraded, and mineralized. The mechanisms of oxidation and the parameters that influence the degradation of pharmaceuticals, as well as the possible degradation pathways, are discussed here. This review provides information on trends of different processes that use Fe0, considering aspects such as particle size, type of matrix, the pharmaceuticals studied, and the results obtained that can improve understanding of new advances in the field of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the degradation and elimination of pharmaceuticals.", "Nanomaterials based electrochemical sensor and biosensor platforms for environmental applications ": "A wide range of toxic chemicals is currently released into the environmental in terms of airborne, aquatic and solid wastes due to the rapid international globalization and industrialization. Thus, a sensitive, reliable and cost-effective sensor platform for emerging environmental pollutants is of great importance. The considerable advancements have been made on the successful electrochemical sensor and biosensor platforms based on nanomaterials for environmental applications. In the present review, the recent trends in the development of the electrochemical sensor platforms based on state-of-the-art nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles, metal oxide nanomaterials, carbon nanomaterials, polymer and biomaterials are assessed. The unique synthetic approaches, properties, integration strategies, selected sensing applications and future prospects of these nanostructured materials for the design of advanced sensor platforms are also highlighted. The significant development of the nanomaterials based electrochemical sensor platforms is giving rise to new impetus of generating novel technologies for securing the human and environmental safety.", "Characterization of natural organic matter in drinking water: Sample preparation and analytical approaches ": "Natural organic matter (NOM) is present in source water worldwide, and it is composed of numerous organic compounds produced in natural processes. NOM has been drawing increasing concerns because it not only affects drinking water treatment on many aspects (e.g., the performance of treatment techniques, necessity of advanced treatment, the dose of treatment chemicals, etc.), but also acts as the main precursor of hazardous drinking water disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Accordingly, to optimize treatment processes and to control the formation of DBPs, it is vital to analyze and characterize NOM for a better understanding of its property and reactivity. In this review, a summary of methods used in NOM analysis and characterization during drinking water treatment was provided, including analysis methods for general parameters (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, (specific) ultraviolet absorbance, fluorescence, polarity, and zeta potential) and characterization methods for elemental and structural identification (e.g., elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry). In addition, preparation and pretreatment methods for NOM were also covered in this review, including isolation and concentration methods (reverse osmosis, pressure-reducing evaporation, freeze-drying, and electrodialysis) as well as fractionation methods (size exclusion chromatography, resin fractionation, membrane filtration, polarity rapid assessment, field-flow fractionation, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography).", "Crowd-sourced air quality studies: A review of the literature & portable sensors ": "Development of low-cost, portable, and low-power devices for monitoring airborne pollutants is a crucial step towards developing improved air quality models and better quantitating the health effects of human and animal exposure. This review article summarizes recent developments in the field within the context of the establishment/expansion of high spatial and temporal resolution air quality monitoring networks. Current \u2018crowd-sourced\u2019 monitoring efforts are summarized, and recent advances in chemical sensors required for these networks are described. No \u2018perfect\u2019 sensing platform, that meets the requirements of low-cost, portability, selectivity, and sensitivity has yet been achieved. This highlights the need for investment in the fundamental analytical chemistry of the sensing platforms required to achieve such \u2018smart-cities.\u2019 Such investment should include the development of new sensor technologies, and provide for calibration and performance validation for systems enacted. In addition to summarizing the current state-of-the-art, reflections on future needs are also offered.", "An overview of advances in dispersive liquid\u2013liquid microextraction for the extraction of pesticides and emerging contaminants from environmental samples ": "Dispersive liquid\u2013liquid microextraction (DLLME) have been explored by analytical chemists, as confirmed by the increasing number of published papers on the topic. In this overview, advances in DLLME for the extraction of pesticides and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from environmental samples is presented. A varied group of DLLME protocols that made possibly the expansion of DLLME applicability are detailed, with special emphasis on modifications that have been successfully employed for pesticides and PPCPs extraction. Interesting solutions published recently, as the use of solvents with a density lower than that of water, the use of ionic liquids and DLLME extractions performed without the need for centrifugation are presented.", "Recent advances in the analysis of nitrogenous disinfection by-products ": "The potential occurrence of nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs) in drinking water raises concerns because of their high genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and carcinogenicity compared to those of carbonaceous DBPs. To meet water quality indexes, drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) adopt a shift from chlorination to chloramination during disinfection to control the formation of regulated DBPs, namely trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. Meanwhile, DWTPs exploit source waters, which contain natural organic matter with high organic nitrogen content, impacted by algal blooms or municipal wastewater effluents to couple with the increasing water demands. However, these changes can result in the increase in the amounts of certain N-DBPs for the incomplete removal of organic nitrogen content and the addition of inorganic nitrogen content. To study the occurrence, formation, and control of N-DBPs, fundamental analysis techniques are indispensable for identifying and quantifying DBPs and their precursors (formation potential) in lab and real water samples. The analytical determination and quantification of DBPs mainly involve three steps, which are pre-treatment, compound separation by chromatography, and identification by detectors. In this paper, we provide a short review and summary of pre-treatment and analytical methods used in the determination of four types of frequently detected N-DBPs, namely halonitromethanes, haloacetonitriles, haloacetamides, and N-nitrosamines. In addition, the analytical methods for other emerging N-DBPs are also covered in this review.", "Basic principles, recent trends and future directions of microextraction techniques for the analysis of aqueous environmental samples ": "Microextraction-based sample preparation techniques have exhibited remarkable importance in analytical chemistry since they were first developed in the 1980s. The application of these techniques involves efficient and, at the same time, environmentally-friendly analytical methodologies. They are also generally faster when compared with classical sample preparation techniques, requiring low solvent and sample volumes, and also allowing for automated or semi-automated procedures. This paper provides an overview of the basic principles of sample preparation techniques and the important applications and developments that have taken place in this area over the past five years. These procedures include solid-phase microextraction (SPME), stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), bar adsorptive microextraction (BA\u03bcE), rotating disk sorptive extraction (RDSE), micro solid-phase extraction (\u03bc-SPE) and liquid-phase microextraction (LPME). The main variations are discussed with a focus on recent applications in the analysis of environmental water samples. Lastly, some of the trends and perspectives associated with these outstanding microextraction sample preparation approaches are highlighted.", "A review of monitoring of airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: An African perspective ": "In this review, we focus on the status of the monitoring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ambient air as well as in living (indoor) and working environments in Africa from 2000 to 2018. This is important as PAHs are ubiquitous in the environment and are known to be potentially carcinogenic. Aspects of sampling such as collection media for particle bound and gaseous PAHs are discussed. The efficiency and basic quality assurance data of commonly employed extraction techniques for separating target PAHs from sampling media using conventional solvent-based and emerging solvent-free approaches were also evaluated. Polyurethane foam and quartz fiber filters are generally the most commonly used collection media for gaseous and particle bound PAHs, respectively. A wide range of total PAH concentrations in ambient air has been reported across the continent of Africa, with the highest levels found at sampling sites close to high density traffic and industrial areas. A rapidly increasing population, commercial and industrial development, poor urban transportation infrastructure and the use of low quality oil products were the main causes of high total gas and particulate PAH concentrations (1.6\u2013103\u202f\u03bcg/m3) in West African port cities such as Cotonou, Benin. With regards to indoor environments, gas phase PAHs were detected at the highest total concentrations in rural areas ranging from 1 to 43\u202f\u03bcg/m3 in Burundi with naphthalene being the most prevalent. Firewood burning was the major emission source in most developing countries and resulted in benzo[a]pyrene concentrations above the European permissible risk level of 1\u202fng/m3.", "Polysaccharides derived from natural sources applied to the development of chemically modified electrodes for environmental applications: A review ": "Potentially toxic organic and inorganic compounds have been released into the environment by different sources. Due to this detrimental problem, the modern analytical chemistry has increasingly acted in the interface of knowledge in terms of developing methods which are robust, efficient, sensitive, inexpensive, and aim at meeting green chemistry principles. From an electroanalytical standpoint, the application of polysaccharides derived from natural sources in the development of chemically modified electrodes has increased in the last decades. Chitosan, cellulose and other polysaccharides have been widely used in the development of modified electrodes due to their high mechanical strength, relatively low cost, and green features. Several studies have reported in the past few years that chemically modified electrodes elaborated with these polysaccharides usually present superior analytical properties as compared to the conventional electrodes. This review describes the general aspects of these polysaccharides, extraction sources, characterization methods, derivatives and crosslinking processes as well as a comprehensive overview of their several applications in the development of new sensors applied to environmental samples.", "Current trends in the analysis and identification of emerging disinfection byproducts ": "Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are a class of compounds generated during chemical disinfection processes. Their wide distribution in potable water supply systems and environmental waters has aroused concerns for both human health and aquatic organisms. Recent toxicological studies have demonstrated that most of the emerging DBPs are significantly more toxic than the regulated DBPs. Analysis techniques are prerequisites for fully understanding DBPs, as they involve identifying and quantifying DBPs, and studying their occurrence and toxicity. Accordingly, this paper reviews current trends in the analysis and identification of emerging DBPs produced in artificial water samples with model substances (e.g., natural organic matter and anthropogenic contaminants) and in real environmental waters (e.g., drinking water, wastewater effluents, swimming pool water, ballast water, cooling water from power stations, and brine reject from desalination plants).", "Opioid occurrence in environmental water samples\u2014A review ": "Opioids are a class of controlled and illicit drugs (narcotics) that act on the nervous system to relieve pain or to create euphoria. Currently, the abuse and addiction to opioids is an epidemic, which is reflected by an exponential increase in deaths by overdose. The occurrence of opioids in the environment may be used both as a tool to estimate human consumption and for making regulatory decisions. This review interprets the last 15 years of opioid detections in wastewater, surface water and drinking-water sources worldwide, in order to establish baseline information for future years. Most opioid studies used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with targeted analytical techniques. The majority of the studies discussed a minor number of opioids, suggesting that a wide range of these compounds have not yet been identified, given the extensive prescription usage. The occurrence of opioids in environmental waters included mainly Europe, UK, the US and Canada. The most frequently detected opioids in wastewater, which is a major source of opioids in surface water, were morphine (5\u20131240\u202fng\u202fL\u22121), codeine (3.1\u20131206\u202fng\u202fL\u22121), methadone (0.9\u2013732\u202fng\u202fL\u22121) and methadone\u2019s metabolite, EDDP (0.12\u20131150\u202fng\u202fL\u22121). These opioids were also found in surface waters, albeit at lower concentrations. Finally, a few non-targeted studies used high resolution accurate mass to determine the transformation products or metabolites, which is an important topic for future research.", "Chemical constituents and analytical approaches for hydraulic fracturing waters ": "Hydraulic fracturing fluids contain a mix of organic and inorganic additives in an aqueous media. The compositions of these mixtures vary according to the region or company use, thus making the process of identifying individual compounds difficult. The analytical characterization of such mixtures is important in order to understand the transport, environmental fate and ultimate potential health impact in various water compartments associated with hydraulic fracturing. Organic compound classes include solvents, gels, biocides, scale inhibitors, friction reducers, surfactants and other related compounds. These contaminants are usually present in trace amounts, so sophisticated analytical methodologies are needed in order to fully characterize the chemical composition of fracking fluids. The current state of knowledge of chemical components and approaches for their analysis is reviewed here. In recent years, modern analytical methodologies, such as gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) have been specifically used to identify organic chemical components of fracking fluids and/or flowback and produced waters associated with the process of hydraulic fracturing. Other techniques such as liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) have not been explored in detail yet. In this review a detailed description of chemical constituents present in hydraulic fracturing waters will be given, as well as an evaluation of the analytical techniques used for their unequivocal determination.", "A critical review of vacuum-assisted headspace solid-phase microextraction for environmental analysis ": "Vacuum-assisted headspace solid-phase microextraction (Vac-HSSPME) is an emerging analytical technique, which further advances HSSPME by providing lower detection limits of analytes with poor volatility at shorter extraction times. This review discusses the theoretical aspects and possibilities of the Vac-HSSPME technique for analysis of environmental samples. Optimization of key parameters, currently available equipment and methods for quantification of organic pollutants in water and soil are considered. Key problems and limitations of the technique are discussed along with possible approaches for its future development. The technique has a well-developed theory, which could be used for modeling of the extraction process, faster method development, and optimization. Wider application of the technique is limited by the lack of automation, which, however, seems possible to develop and implement by manufacturers of commercial multi-purpose autosamplers for gas chromatography instruments. It has been shown that Vac-HSSPME allows decreasing cross-contamination of samples from the laboratory air, which is advantageous for identification and quantification of trace environmental pollutants. Simple equipment for the technique makes it possible to apply for on-site sample preparation and analysis of environmental samples.", "Recent progress and perspective of trace antibiotics detection in aquatic environment by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ": "The abused antibiotic residue either in natural environment or food is a serious issue for both public health and ecological environment. Therefore, various techniques have been developed for the qualitative and quantitative of trace antibiotics in food, drinking water and human body fluid. Among them, Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a developing technique, which outstands itself with high sensitivity and selectivity. Our presentation takes especially great care to highlight the main progresses and challenges of SERS in the trace antibiotic detection in aquatic, biosystem and food science to illustrate key aspects of this technology. Even though many advances have already been made in this area, there are many hurdles, such as the sensitivity, selectivity, stability and reproducibility, need to be overcome to bring this technology up to the level of the on-site practical application in aquatic environment. This review is written for specialists in the field and a general environment\u2013ecosystem\u2013chemistry readership.", "Pd/ZnO catalysts for direct CO2 hydrogenation to methanol ": "The direct hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol is crucial for providing a means of CO2 fixation and a way to store cleanly produced hydrogen in a more energy-dense and transportable form. Here we have prepared two series of Pd/ZnO catalysts, both by immobilisation of PVA-protected Pd colloids and by Pd impregnation of PdCl2 to investigate structure activity relationships for direct CO2 hydrogenation. Very different performances were found for the different preparation methods, and the Pd loading and pre-reduction of the catalysts were shown to be important factors for optimising methanol yield. The crucial factor for high methanol yield is the formation of a Pd\u2013Zn alloy, either during the reaction itself, or better by high temperature pre-reduction. The formation of the alloy greatly reduces CO production by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The catalysts prepared by sol-immobilisation were relatively stable to thermal treatment. In contrast, the impregnated catalysts were much less thermally stable, due to the presence of remnant chloride on the surface of the catalyst, which was absent for the case of sol immobilisation preparation. The results illustrate the importance of controlling the PdZn particle size and its surface structure for the catalysts to achieve high methanol selectivity (60%, the rest being CO) and conversion (11%) at 250\u00b0C and 20bar. Selectivity for sol-immobilised catalysts decreases from 60% at 3nm average diameter, to 20% at 7nm.", "From the Sabatier principle to a predictive theory of transition-metal heterogeneous catalysis ": "We discuss three concepts that have made it possible to develop a quantitative understanding of trends in transition-metal catalysis: scaling relations, activity maps, and the d-band model. Scaling relations are correlations between surface bond energies of different adsorbed species including transition states; they open the possibility of mapping the many parameters determining the rate of a full catalytic reaction onto a few descriptors. The resulting activity map can be viewed as a quantitative implementation of the classical Sabatier principle, which states that there is an optimum \u201cbond strength\u201d defining the best catalyst for a given reaction. In the modern version, the scaling relations determine the relevant \u201cbond strengths\u201d and the fact that these descriptors can be measured or calculated makes it a quantitative theory of catalysis that can be tested experimentally by making specific predictions of new catalysts. The quantitative aspect of the model therefore provides new possibilities in catalyst design. Finally, the d-band model provides an understanding of the scaling relations and variations in catalytic activity in terms of the electronic structure of the transition-metal surface.", "TiO2/MXene Ti3C2 composite with excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity ": "Photocatalytic CO2 reduction for solar fuel production has received enormous attention due to its ability for solving both energy crisis and CO2 pollution. However, fabrication of cheap and efficient materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction is still challenging. Herein, TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) in situ grew on highly conductive MXene Ti3C2 through calcination method. And a unique rice crust-like structure was achieved through the uniform distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles on Ti3C2. This optimized TiO2/Ti3C2 composite exhibited a 3.7\u202ftimes higher photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance for CH4-production (0.22\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fh\u22121) than commercial TiO2 (P25). The detailed photocatalytic CO2 reduction mechanism using TiO2/Ti3C2 was confirmed through the 13CO2 isotopic test and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Experimental evidence along with preliminary calculation was also used to further elucidate the proposed photocatalytic enhancement mechanism. This extraordinary photocatalytic performance was due to the unique morphology and the features of individual components in the composite. Namely, fluffy rice crust-like structure of the prepared samples rendered the composite with large population of the surface-active sites. Ultrahigh conductivity of Ti3C2 facilitated the photogenerated electron transfer and suppressed its recombination with photogenerated holes. This work presents a simple method to prepare highly efficient TiO2/Ti3C2 composite for photoconversion applications.", "A direct Z-scheme g-C3N4/SnS2 photocatalyst with superior visible-light CO2 reduction performance ": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to solar fuels is an ideal approach to simultaneously solve the global warming and energy crisis issues. Constructing a direct Z-scheme heterojunction is an effective way to overcome the drawbacks of single-component or conventional heterogeneous photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Here, a novel type of direct Z-scheme g-C3N4/SnS2 heterojunction was constructed by depositing SnS2 quantum dots onto the g-C3N4 surface in situ via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. l-Cysteine not only acted as the sulfur source, but also grafted ammine groups onto g-C3N4 in the hydrothermal process, which greatly enhanced the CO2 uptake of the composite. XPS analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation show that electron transfer occurred from g-C3N4 to SnS2, resulting in the formation of interfacial internal electric fields (IEF) between the two semiconductors at equilibrium. As a result, Z-scheme charge transfer took place under photoexcitation, with the electrons in SnS2 combining with the holes in g-C3N4, which improved the extraction and utilization of photoinduced electron in g-C3N4. The g-C3N4/SnS2 hybrid shows superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction as compared with individual g-C3N4 and SnS2, which should be attributed to the IEF-induced direct Z-scheme as well as improved CO2 adsorption capacity. In situ FTIR spectra illustrate that HCOOH appeared as an intermediate during the CO2 conversion, which can only be generated by g-C3N4 according to the energy level of the photoinduced electrons, further confirming the Z-scheme configuration for the g-C3N4/SnS2 system.", "Origin of Pd-Cu bimetallic effect for synergetic promotion of methanol formation from CO2 hydrogenation ": "A strong synergetic effect was observed in our previous work on Pd-Cu bimetallic catalysts for CH3OH formation from CO2 hydrogenation when the Pd/(Pd\u202f+\u202fCu) atomic ratio lied within 0.25\u20130.34. In the present study, the importance of Pd-Cu alloy in selective CH3OH promotion was evidenced and correlated with alloy contents quantitatively through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron spectroscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM/EDS), and H2-O2 titration and N2O titration. The surface chemical properties of Pd-Cu combinations were characterized by H2-/CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), diffuse reflectance infrared FT spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally evaluated along with monometallic counterparts. Detailed characterization results reveal a unique shift in adsorption towards weakly-bonded H2 and CO2 on Pd-Cu bimetallic surface which appear to correlate to the CH3OH promotion. DFT calculations on adsorption properties of H2 and CO2 show good agreement with the observation from TPD experiments. DFT study also provides insights into the impact of Pd-Cu combination on the activation and initial hydrogenation of CO2 to formate (HCOO\u2217) and hydrocarboxyl (COOH\u2217) intermediates. HCOO\u2217 formation was found to be kinetically more favored than COOH\u2217 on monometallic Cu and Pd-Cu surfaces. The lowest barrier for HCOO\u2217 formation was observed at Pd/(Pd\u202f+\u202fCu) atomic ratio of 0.33, around which a good CO2 conversion and high methanol selectivity were achieved experimentally.", "0D/2D NiS2/V-MXene composite for electrocatalytic H2 evolution ": "As a member of the family of so-called MXenes, two-dimensional vanadium carbide (V2CT\n                        x\n                     , denoted as V-MXene) used in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still in the stage of theoretical study without significant experimental exploration. Here, we present the theoretical and experimental studies on the intrinsic structural and electrochemical properties of V-MXene-based hybrid (NiS2/V-MXene) to verify the possibility of using it as a potential electrocatalyst for HER. For the purpose of comparison, the most popular titanium carbide (Ti3C2T\n                        x\n                     , denoted as Ti-MXene) is studied too. As a proof of concept, NiS2/V-MXene and NiS2/Ti-MXene, are designed, prepared and experimentally explored. As expected, NiS2/V-MXene is proved to be a better electrocatalyst for HER than NiS2/Ti-MXene due to its faster electronic transfer and favorable interactions. The tight cover of NiS2 nanoparticles not only prevents V-MXene from restacking but also favors the exposure of extra active sites to accelerate the electrolysis process. Such a unique sandwich-like architecture is highly preferable to provide larger contact interface and more pathways for electron migration and mass diffusion during the electrolysis. Meanwhile, the predicted electron transfer from V-MXene to NiS2 is confirmed experimentally using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This research may provide a guide for the design and development of V-MXene-based electrocatalysts for HER, and expand their potential applications.", "Metal-organic framework encapsulated single-atom Pt catalysts for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution ": "Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have emerged as a new research frontier in the catalytic community due to the utmost atom efficiency and tunable functionality in a wide variety of catalytic reactions. In the present work, a general operable synthetic platform for stable and well-defined positioned single-atom metal catalysts encapsulated in metal-organic framework (MOF) architecture was developed. Using the MOF-808 based single ion trap method, single metal ions were effectively captured by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) ligands, which were exchanged with the original formate ligands anchored at the Zr6 cluster metal nodes. Upon activated in hydrogen atmosphere at 200\u202f\u00b0C, the stable MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom metal catalysts with well-defined atomic positions were synthesized. The synthesized single-atom metal catalysts were confirmed using various experimental characterization techniques including high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy analysis, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform, as well as theoretical density functional theory calculations. As a demonstration case, it has been found that the as-synthesized MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst shows the excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (68.33\u202fmmol\u202fg\u22121\u202fh\u22121) and high stability. The apparent quantum efficiency reaches up to 67.6% at 420\u202fnm. This work not only provides a general and effective synthesis approach for preparing stable, uniformly distributed, MOF encapsulated single-atom metal catalysts such as Pd, Rh, Ru, Cu, Co, and Ni, but also sheds new insights into single-atom metal catalysts for photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production.", "Formation of PdO on Au\u2013Pd bimetallic catalysts and the effect on benzyl alcohol oxidation ": "A series of catalysts consisting of gold\u2013palladium bimetallic nanoparticles (Au\u2013Pd NPs in the range of 1\u20136\u202fnm) anchored on foamlike mesoporous silica were used for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. A remarkable synergistic effect was observed on these Au\u2013Pd NP catalysts prepared by a one-pot method. Both experimental and theoretical study revealed a close relationship between the surface PdO species on the catalysts and their catalytic performance; that is, higher surface PdO content leads to lower catalytic activity. The surface content of PdO species on the catalysts could be tuned by controlling the Au/Pd ratios, because the formation of Au\u2013Pd alloy NPs and electron transfer between surface Au and Pd atoms prevented the oxidation of surface Pd and retarded the formation of PdO species. An optimal Au/Pd ratio of 1/4.5 on the foamlike mesoporous silica support was obtained, with nearly no surface PdO species formed, and resulted in the highest benzyl alcohol conversion of 96%. The bimetallic Au\u2013Pd catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activity for benzyl alcohol oxidation (TOF\u202f=\u202f50,000\u201360,000\u202fh\u22121) than the monometallic Pd catalyst (TOF\u202f=\u202f12,500\u202fh\u22121), on which surface Pd is easily oxidized to PdO. These results provide direct evidence for the synergistic effect of Au\u2013Pd bimetallic catalysts in benzyl alcohol oxidation.", "N-doped graphene as catalysts for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions: Theoretical considerations ": "Electrocatalysts are essential to two key electrochemical reactions, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in renewable energy conversion and storage technologies such as regenerative fuel cells and rechargeable metal\u2013air batteries. Here, we explored N-doped graphene as cost-effective electrocatalysts for these key reactions by employing density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the substitution of carbon at graphene edge by nitrogen results in the best performance in terms of overpotentials. For armchair nanoribbons, the lowest OER and ORR overpotentials were estimated to be 0.405V and 0.445V, respectively, which are comparable to those for Pt-containing catalysts. OER and ORR with the minimum overpotentials can occur near the edge on the same structure but different sites. These calculations suggest that engineering the edge structures of the graphene can increase the efficiency of the N-doped graphene as efficient OER/ORR electrocatalysts for metal\u2013air batteries, water splitting, and regenerative fuel cells.", "Unveiling coke formation mechanism in MFI zeolites during methanol-to-hydrocarbons conversion ": "Coke formation over MFI zeolites of different crystallite sizes was rigorously investigated in methanol-to-hydrocarbon conversion (MTH). The key experimental idea was based on the fact that soft coke in the zeolite micropores (internal coke) could be selectively removed by thermal treatment under H2, while heavy coke at the zeolite external surface (external coke) remained intact. This enabled us to analyze the amount, composition, chemical nature, and deactivating effects of internal and external cokes, separately. As the mass transfer of hydrocarbons was retarded with increasing zeolite crystallite size, an aromatic-based catalytic cycle became dominant in MTH compared to an olefin-based cycle. Consequently, methylated benzene intermediates were accumulated within the zeolite micropores. These methylated benzenes could also act as coke precursors and polymerize to form internal coke within the micropores. Aromatic products that diffused out of zeolite micropores could also be condensed at the external surface of the zeolite crystallites. Once the carbon deposits were formed at the external zeolite surface, the external coke continued to grow even non-catalytically by the thermal reaction with the methylated benzenes. Different zeolite catalysts and reaction times affected only the relative amounts of internal and external cokes, but not their respective chemical natures. The internal coke appeared to have the H/C ratio of 1.26 and a density of 1.0\u202fg\u202fcm\u22123, while the external coke had much lower H/C ratio (0.28) and higher density (1.5\u202fg\u202fcm\u22123). We propose that internal coke is likely to have the polymeric structures of the methylated acenes (i.e., linearly fused aromatic rings such as benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene) connected via methylene bridges. On the other hand, the external coke is highly polyaromatic with many fused rings. In terms of catalyst deactivation, the internal coke proved to be much more detrimental than the external coke.", "Catalytic consequences of ultrafine Pt clusters supported on SrTiO3 for photocatalytic overall water splitting ": "The metal cluster size in supported metal catalysts impacts the oxidation state of the metal atoms, coordination capability, and finally the catalytic activity\u2014especially when the number of atoms becomes countable. The correlation between metal oxidation state and its catalytic consequences for ultrafine Pt was studied for photocatalytic overall water splitting using a Pt/SrTiO3 (photo)catalyst. A distinctive change in catalytic behavior and oxidation state was observed below 100\u202fPt-atom clusters at \u223c2\u202fnm. Combining density functional theory (DFT) and experimental characterizations including X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), the smaller Pt clusters obtained by the surface organometallic route (under 100\u202fPt atoms) were predominantly oxidized and selectively performed photocatalytic water splitting selectively without activation of the water-forming back-reaction from H2 and O2. When the Pt clusters obtained by classical impregnation were larger than 2\u202fnm, they remained metallic (Pt0) and were active for both water splitting and the competing thermal water formation back reaction. In addition, Pt0 clusters are poisoned in the presence of CO, whereas highly dispersed ultra-fine oxidized Pt clusters are insensitive to CO. This paper presents evidence of ultrafine PtO\n                        x\n                      (below approximately 2\u202fnm clusters) that are insensitive to coordination of various gas identities (H2, O2, CO), resulting in efficient and selective photocatalytic overall water splitting.", "Impregnation of semiconductor CdS NPs in MOFs cavities via double solvent method for effective photocatalytic CO2 conversion ": "Construction of MOF-based photocatalysts is promising work due to their considerable active sites and flexible structures. Herein, we present a facile double solvent and in-situ-growth strategy to integrate CdS NPs with MIL-101(Cr) to engineer CdS/MIL-101(Cr) composite photocatalyst. As-prepared CdS/MIL-101(Cr) samples were characterized by TEM, SEM, BET, EPR, XPS, TPC and ESI. CdS/MIL-101(Cr) exhibited remarkable enhanced activity for conversion CO2 to CO under visible light irradiation, and the 36% CdS/MIL-101(Cr) showed the optimal performance in the all samples. The superior activity was attributed to following factors. The strong interaction between CdS and MIL-101(Cr) promoted the separation and transferring of the photogenerated charge carriers. A higher utilization efficiency of photoelectrons could be achieved with the MIL-101(Cr) possessing multiple absorptions and active sites for the photoreduction of CO2. Also, CdS/MIL-101(Cr) provided a special transferring path for photoelectrons, from CdS to MIL-101(Cr), then to photoreduction of CO2, which could be certified by the calculation of energy-level and the survey of \n                        \n                     O2\n                     \u2013 of CdS and MIL-101(Cr).", "Understanding the generation of methanol synthesis and water gas shift activity over copper-based catalysts \u2013 A spatially resolved experimental kinetic study using steady and non-steady state operation under CO/CO2/H2 feeds ": "Understanding the mechanism and generation of activity for methanol synthesis and the water gas shift reactions over copper-based catalysts remains a significant area of study in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, steady and non-steady state experimental and kinetic modelling methods are presented to demonstrate changes in functionality of a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst based on gas composition.\n                  Steady-state testing of a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, using experimental spatial discretisation approaches with fixed-bed, integral-operation micro reactors, has generated performance data over a range of P\n                     CO/P\n                     CO2 ratios (1\u201310). The data showed a mixture of observations where forward or reverse water gas shift was kinetically favourable, and also where the reaction was significantly limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. A steady state Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model based on micro kinetics was most appropriate which includes kinetic descriptions of both directions of the water gas shift reaction. Using this method, the entire dataset could be predicted and an internal consistency within the kinetic model of the key adsorption constants was demonstrated.\n                  Non-steady state, \u2018reactor start-up\u2019, testing of a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst marked a novel approach to further understanding the functionality of the catalyst. Initial changes in surface carbon and oxygen populations were quantified and linked to subsequent dynamic changes in methanol synthesis and water gas shift activity. Cu/ZnO and Cu/Al2O3 formulations were also evaluated and tested using kinetic models, permitting a structural and compositional comparison with Cu/ZnO/Al2O3.", "Se-modified polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets with improved photocatalytic activities ": "The carbon nitride (CN) with selenide (Se) modification and porous thin nanosheet structure (m-CNNSs) has been successfully presented via an effective two-step continuous thermal treatment method. The as-prepared m-CNNSs show a photocatalytic H2 generation and CO2 reduction performance under visible light, the apparent quantum yield of H2 generation (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f420\u202fnm) reached 8.1%. This improved photocatalytic performance originates from the large surface areas and porous nanostructure that accelerated separation of photoexcited charge carriers and promoted mass-transfer process. Particularly, the formation of the Se modified in the thin CN sheets further endow it with reduced band gap, more exposed active edges, and extended visible light absorption range. This work not only presents a simple strategy to enhance the photocatalytic performance for CN, but also opens ups a new pathway for the rational preparation of effective polymeric photocatalysts by harnessing the synergistic effects to simultaneously optimize the electronic and frame structure of polymeric photocatalysts.", "2D transition metal\u2013TCNQ sheets as bifunctional single-atom catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) ": "The identification of catalytically active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) would revolutionize rechargeable metal-air batteries and regenerative fuel cell technologies. In this study, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systemically investigate 2D transition metal based tetracyanoquinodimethane (TM\u2013TCNQ, TM\u202f=\u202fCr-Cu, Ru-Ag, Pt, Ir) monolayers with single TM atoms catalysts (SACs) distributed periodically with high density. We calculate a lower limiting overpotential of \u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.33\u202fV for Fe-TCNQ yielding a higher expected activity than that of Pt metal (0.48\u202fV) for the ORR under acidic conditions. The catalytic performance of Fe-TCNQ for OER is, however, surpassed by Ni-TCNQs (\u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.46\u202fV), which is identified as the highest among the candidates. By applying grafting axial ligands and external strain, the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on TM reactive sites can be further optimized and enhances the activities of Mn-, Fe- and Ni-TCNQs for the ORR or the OER. Here, Fe-TCNQ-Cl (\u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.27/0.55\u202fV), followed by Fe-TCNQ-CO (\u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.67/0.43\u202fV), are predicted as novel, high-performance bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts with comparable limiting overpotentials to those of the best commercially used electrocatalysts, Pt (ORR: \u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.48\u202fV) and RuO2 (OER: \u03b7lim\u202f=\u202f0.42\u202fV). In addition, the recently synthesized Fe-TCNQ possess excellent conductivity with fast electron transfer during the catalytic reactions. These results show 2D TM-TCNQ monolayers are durable, low-cost, and efficient catalysts for the ORR and the OER in metal-air batteries and fuel cells.", "A combo Zr-HY and Al-HY zeolite catalysts for the one-pot cascade transformation of biomass-derived furfural to \u03b3-valerolactone ": "A highly efficient catalyst system was developed for the one-pot transformation of furfural to \u03b3-valerolactone (GVL) in an open system. The cascade of two Meerwein Ponndorf Verley (MPV) reductions, ring-opening and esterification reactions was catalyzed by a physical mixture of Zr- and Al-HY zeolites where the proportion and strength of Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acid sites could be independently optimized. The excellent activity of Zr-HY zeolites for the MPV reduction of furfural and levulinate ester with 2-pentanol as hydrogen donor was attributed to the larger pore size of HY-zeolites and stronger Lewis acidic sites compared to Zr-Beta. Al-HY zeolites were more effective as Br\u00f8nsted acid than Al-Beta because they converted furfuryl ether to levulinate ester rather than to \u03b2-angelica lactone. The dual catalytic system comprising Zr-HY (Si/Zr 20) and Al-HY (Si/Al 6) exhibited remarkably high catalytic activity with GVL yields of 85% after only 5\u202fh at 120\u202f\u00b0C.", "Origin and prevention of broad particle size distributions in carbon-supported palladium catalysts prepared by liquid-phase reduction ": "Carbon-supported palladium (Pd/C) catalysts often display broad or multimodal Pd particle size distributions detrimental for their performance. Therefore, the formation of large particles during preparation should be better understood and avoided. We prepared catalysts with up to 10\u202fwt% Pd supported on oxygen-functionalized carbon nanotubes and activated carbon via liquid-phase reduction. It was inferred that small Pd particles (\u223c1\u202fnm) were formed from Pd ions adsorbed on the carbon. At higher loadings, up to 65% of the Pd ended up in larger particles (>10\u202fnm) probably formed from Pd ions in solution, lowering the Pd-normalized activity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde 4-fold compared to samples with small particles only. Three key factors were identified for preparing Pd/C catalysts with exclusively \u223c1\u202fnm Pd particles: a support with a high density of acid sites and high specific surface area, and a metal loading at molar ratio Pd/acid sites <0.5.", "Tuning CO2 hydrogenation selectivity via metal-oxide interfacial sites ": "CO2 hydrogenation over ZrO2-supported NiFe catalysts is investigated to illustrate the role of Fe in controlling the activity and selectivity, and to reveal the structure-function relationship between metal-oxide interfaces and catalytic selectivities. The Ni-ZrO2 interfaces and Ni-FeO\n                        x\n                      interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for the methanation reaction and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, respectively, using combined in-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques. The reaction mechanisms of CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 on the Ni-ZrO2 interfacial sites and to CO on the Ni-FeO\n                        x\n                      interfacial sites are further revealed by combined in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the binding energy of absorbed CO (*CO) is a key descriptor to predict CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: weak interaction (e.g., Ni-FeO\n                        x\n                      interfaces) promotes *CO desorption to increase CO selectivity, while moderate interaction (e.g., Ni-ZrO2 interfaces) facilitates further hydrogenation of *CO to produce CH4.", "The Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Evans\u2013Polanyi relation and the volcano curve in heterogeneous catalysis ": "A number of elementary reactions at metal surfaces show a linear Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Evans\u2013Polanyi relation between the activation energy and the reaction energy, and reactions belonging to the same class even follow the same relation. We investigate the implications of this finding on the kinetics of surface-catalyzed chemical processes. We focus in particular on the variation in the activity from one metal to the next. By analyzing a number of simple microkinetic models we show that the reaction rate under given reaction conditions shows a maximum as a function of the dissociative adsorption energy of the key reactant, and that for most conditions this maximum is in the same range of reaction energies. We also provide a database of chemisorption energies calculated using density-functional theory for a number of simple gas molecules on 13 different transition metals. An important part of the analysis consists of developing a general framework for analyzing the maximum rate. We use these concepts to rationalize trends in the catalytic activity of a number of metals for the methanation process.", "Size, nanostructure, and composition dependence of bimetallic Au\u2013Pd supported on ceria\u2013zirconia mixed oxide catalysts for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol ": "A bimetallic Au\u2013Pd catalyst supported on ceria\u2013zirconia with Au:Pd molar ratio 0.8 has been synthesized using a simultaneous deposition\u2013precipitation method and oxidized at 250, 450, and 700\u202f\u00b0C in order to modify its particle size, nanostructure, and composition. Combined X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis clearly evidence that the bimetallic Au\u2013Pd catalyst oxidized at 250\u202f\u00b0C is made up of a mixture of monometallic Au and Pd and bimetallic Au\u2013Pd nanoparticles with Au:Pd ratios varying over a wide range. Increasing oxidation temperature leads to a stronger interaction between Au and Pd. Meanwhile, a slight increase of particle size and a narrowing of the Au:Pd ratio in the bimetallic nanoparticles take place. Compared with titania and activated carbon supports, the resistance against sintering at high temperatures of Au\u2013Pd metal particles supported on ceria\u2013zirconia is proven to be higher. A synergistic effect has been observed for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol on these catalysts. The catalytic activity decreases only slightly after oxidation at 450\u202f\u00b0C. However, oxidation at 700\u202f\u00b0C results in much lower catalytic activity. Migration of Pd onto Au particles during oxidation of benzyl alcohol enhances the catalytic activity of a physical mixture of monometallic Au and Pd supported on ceria\u2013zirconia catalysts. This fact, jointly with an analysis of the intrinsic activity, reveals the influence of the actual nature of Au\u2013Pd interactions in the bimetallic particles, which points to higher activity of Au@Pd or AuPd@Pd nanostructures on ceria\u2013zirconia supports.", "Nature of stable single atom Pt catalysts dispersed on anatase TiO2\n             ": "Pt single atom catalysts anchored on the surface of anatase TiO2 have recently been shown to be stable through oxidation and reduction conditions and exhibit higher catalytic activity in CO oxidation than Pt metallic clusters. In this work we unravel the atomistic nature of the isolated Ptiso species on anatase TiO2 thanks to the combination of CO probe molecule Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments with an extensive set of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. We used the stretching frequencies and adsorption energies of CO bound to Pt as a fingerprint of the specific structure of the stable Ptiso species. These consist of Pt atoms bound to two excess O atoms on the surface (PtO2). The excess oxygen atoms on the surface arise from the formation of surface hydroxyl groups, and provide a solid anchor to the oxide support, which explains the high thermal stability of the single-atom Pt catalyst through oxidative and reductive treatments. Beside the single atom Pt species, also models of metallic, Ptmetal, and oxidized, Ptox, sub-nanometer clusters have been considered. Comparisons between characteristics of Ptiso species and sub-nanometer Ptmetal and Ptox clusters demonstrate that the combination of CO vibrational frequency and adsorption energy can be an effective approach to differentiate these species.", "Selective conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to diketone derivatives over Beta zeolite-supported Pd catalysts in water ": "Conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in water to the linear diketone derivatives 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione (HHD) and 2,5-hexanedione (HXD) was investigated over a series of Beta zeolite-supported transition metal catalysts (Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Pd). Their catalytic performance was tested in a batch stirred reactor (T\u202f=\u202f110\u202f\u00b0C, PH2\u202f=\u202f20\u202fbar) with Pd showing the highest activity and selectivity to HHD and HXD. The effects of Pd particle size, zeolite Si/Al ratio and reaction conditions (T\u202f=\u202f80\u2013155\u202f\u00b0C, PH2\u202f=\u202f5\u201360\u202fbar) were also investigated. The incorporation of Pd into Beta zeolite by the deposition-coprecipitation method produced the most efficient catalyst, affording complete HMF conversion (T\u202f=\u202f110\u202f\u00b0C, PH2\u202f=\u202f60\u202fbar) predominantly to HHD (68% selectivity) and HXD (8% selectivity). The combination of a bifunctional acid/redox solid catalyst and water enhances the hydrolytic ring-opening and subsequent hydrogenation of the furan ring. Catalytic activity can be partially restored by a simple regeneration treatment. This work establishes a catalytic route to produce valuable diketone derivatives from renewable furanic platform sources in water.", "Mechanistic insights into the iridium-catalyzed hydrosilylation of allyl compounds ": "The hydrosilylation of allyl compounds is very important for the industrial production of \u03b3-substituted propylsilanes; however, it is also a process known to suffer from either substantial selectivity issues or short catalyst lifetimes. While there are reports on the platinum-catalyzed variant, this study is the first comprehensive work on the more recently employed iridium-catalyzed process. A combination of stoichiometric and catalytic experiments as well as reactions with isotope-labeled compounds is used to elucidate the critical parameters influencing the catalytic performance and to identify the main deactivation pathways. This report is intended to pave the way toward the optimization of current iridium-catalyzed processes and the design and synthesis of improved catalyst structures.", "Decoupling structure-sensitive deactivation mechanisms of Ir/IrOx electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction ": "Deterioration of intrinsic activity of Ir-based electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has received much less attention compared to the metal dissolution. Combining chronoamperometry with operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, we show that the deactivation via active site phase transformation from hydrous Ir oxide/hydroxide into anhydrous Ir oxide, is concomitant with the dissolution-induced loss of electrochemical surface area. The relative contributions from these deactivation paths were found to be structure sensitive. Systematic evaluation of different Ir-based catalysts at identical electro-oxidative conditions showed that hydrous IrOx with structural short-range order exhibited an initial minor degradation of intrinsic activity but the most significant dissolution after the extended stability test. In contrast, newly-reported Ir superstructures with higher crystallinity and larger proportion of low-index crystal terminations exhibited enhanced resistance to dissolution but a major degradation of intrinsic activity, as the performance-relevant hydrous oxide/hydroxide species developed only on the surface of metallic Ir. The Ir/IrOx catalyst regeneration was demonstrated.", "Microfragmenting for the successful restoration of slow growing massive corals ": "Slow growing, massive stony corals have often been overlooked in reef-restoration activities, despite their resilience to climate change and contribution to reef framework. Techniques to effectively propagate and outplant these species have proven challenging. However, advancement in methodology may increase rates of success. In 2013, Orbicella faveolata and Montastrea cavernosa fragments were outplanted on reefs in the Florida Keys at a nearshore and offshore location, to determine whether \u201cmicrofragmenting\u201d corals, the process of creating \u223c1\u202fcm2 fragments, increased outplant survival and growth compared with larger fragments (16\u201364\u202fcm2).\n                  Arrays of eight microfragments were planted near one larger fragment of similar size at each location. Six replicate pairs were haphazardly placed within each \u223c700\u202fm2 study site. Fragments at both sites were monitored for growth and survival over 31\u202fmonths, spanning two bleaching events. Initial predation occurred on microfragments, but was absent in the larger fragments. Survival and growth differed between sites, but did not differ between the larger fragments and microfragment arrays. However, excluding plots with >40% predation at the nearshore site showed that O. faveolata microfragment arrays produced 10 times more tissue than traditionally used larger fragments. Results from this study suggest that if predation events are reduced, massive corals can be successfully grown and outplanted for restoration purposes.", "Wetlands as large-scale nature-based solutions: Status and challenges for research, engineering and management ": "Wetlands are often considered as nature-based solutions that can provide a multitude of services of great social, economic and environmental value to humankind. Changes in land-use, water-use and climate can all impact wetland functions and services. These changes occur at scales extending well beyond the local scale of an individual wetland. However, in practical applications, engineering and management decisions usually focus on individual wetland projects and local site conditions. Here, we systematically investigate if and to what extent research has addressed the large-scale dynamics of landscape systems with multiple wetlands, hereafter referred to as wetlandscapes, which are likely to be relevant for understanding impacts of regional to global change. Although knowledge in many cases is still limited, evidence suggests that the aggregated effects of multiple wetlands in the landscape can differ considerably from the functions observed at individual wetland scales. This applies to provisioning of ecosystem services such as coastal protection, biodiversity support, groundwater level and soil moisture regulation, flood regulation and contaminant retention. We show that parallel and circular flow-paths, through which wetlands are interconnected in the landscape, may largely control such scale-function differences. We suggest ways forward for addressing the mismatch between the scales at which changes take place and the scale at which observations and implementation are currently made. These suggestions can help bridge gaps between researchers and engineers, which is critical for improving wetland function-effect predictability and management.", "Green roof performance towards management of runoff water quantity and quality: A review ": "This review paper addresses the role of green roofs in urban drainage considering both management of water quantity and quality. Results from investigation of full scale installations as well as from laboratory models are reviewed. The following factors affecting runoff dynamics from green roofs are discussed: type of green roof and its geometrical properties (slope); soil moisture characteristics; season, weather and rainfall characteristics; age of green roof; vegetation. Design parameters as suggested by different authors are also reviewed. Factors which affect influence of a green roof on runoff water quality are discussed in general terms followed by the review of data regarding concentrations of phosphorus, nitrogen, and heavy metals in green roof runoff, its\u2019 pH, and first flush effect. Linking among fertilization, runoff pollution and vegetation development is given a particular focus. The review indicates clearly that there is a need for more research into a green roof performance in an urban environment. The differences measured by few existing studies between the early years performance of green roofs and the later years indicate a need for long term monitoring of green roofs.", "Effects of different soil media, vegetation, and hydrologic treatments on nutrient and sediment removal in roadside bioretention systems ": "Water quality performance of eight roadside bioretention cells in their third and fourth years of implementation were evaluated in Burlington, Vermont. Bioretention cells received varying treatments: (1) vegetation with high-diversity (7 species) and low-diversity plant mix (2 species); (2) proprietary SorbtiveMedia\u2122 (SM) containing iron and aluminum oxide granules to enhance sorption capacity for phosphorus; and (3) enhanced rainfall and runoff (RR) to certain cells (including one with SM treatment) at three levels (15%, 20%, 60% more than their control counterparts), mimicking anticipated precipitation increases associated with climate change. A total of 121 storms across all cells were evaluated in 2015 and 2016 for total suspended solids (TSS), nitrate/nitrite-nitrogen (NOx), ortho-phosphorus (Ortho-P), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Heavy metals were also measured for a few storms, but in 2014 and 2015 only. Simultaneous measurements of flow rates and volumes allowed for evaluation of the cells\u2019 hydraulic performances and estimation of pollutant load removal efficiencies and EMC reductions. Significant average reductions in effluent stormwater volumes (75%; range: 48\u201396%) and peak flows (91%; range: 86\u201396%) was reported, with 31% of the storms events (all less than 25.4\u202fmm (1 in.), and one 39.4\u202fmm (1.55 in.)) depth completely captured by bioretention cells. Influent TSS concentrations and event mean concentrations (EMCs) was mostly significantly reduced, and TSS loads were well retained by all bioretention cells (94%; range: 89\u201399%) irrespective of treatments, storm characteristics or seasonality. In contrast, nutrient removal was treatment-dependent, where the SM treatments consistently removed P concentrations, loads and EMCs, and sometimes N as well. The vegetation and RR treatments mostly exported nutrients to the effluent for those three metrics with varying significance. We attribute observed nutrient exports to the presence of excess compost in the soil media. Rainfall depth and peak inflow rate had consistently negative effects on all nutrient removal efficiencies from the bioretention cells likely by increasing pollutant mobilization. Seasonality followed by soil media presence, and antecedent dry period were other predictors significantly influencing removal efficiencies for some nutrient types. Results from the analysis will be useful to make bioretention designers aware of the hydrologic and other design factors that will be the most critical to the performance of the bioretention systems in response to interactive effects of climate change.", "Beneficial use of dredged sediment to enhance salt marsh development by applying a \u2018Mud Motor\u2019 ": "We test an innovative approach to beneficially re-use dredged sediment to enhance salt marsh development. A Mud Motor is a dredged sediment disposal in the form of a semi-continuous source of mud in a shallow tidal channel allowing natural processes to disperse the sediment to nearby mudflats and salt marshes. We describe the various steps in the design of a Mud Motor pilot: numerical simulations with a sediment transport model to explore suitable disposal locations, a tracer experiment to measure the transport fate of disposed mud, assessment of the legal requirements, and detailing the planning and technical feasibility. An extensive monitoring and research programme was designed to measure sediment transport rates and the response of intertidal mudflats and salt marshes to an increased sediment load. Measurements include the sediment transport in the tidal channel and on the shallow mudflats, the vertical accretion of intertidal mudflats and salt marsh, and the salt marsh vegetation cover and composition. In the Mud Motor pilot a total of 470,516\u202fm3 of fine grained sediment (D50 of \u223c10\u202f\u03bcm) was disposed over two winter seasons, with an average of 22 sediment disposals per week of operation. Ship-based measurements revealed a periodic vertical salinity stratification that is inverted compared to a classical estuary and that is working against the asymmetric flood-dominated transport direction. Field measurements on the intertidal mudflats showed that the functioning of the Mud Motor, i.e. the successful increased mud transport toward the salt marsh, is significantly dependent on wind and wave forcing. Accretion measurements showed relatively large changes in surface elevation due to deposition and erosion of layers of watery mud with a thickness of up to 10\u202fcm on a time scale of days. The measurements indicate notably higher sediment dynamics during periods of Mud Motor disposal. The salt marsh demonstrated significant vertical accretion though this has not yet led to horizontal expansion because there was more hydrodynamic stress than foreseen. In carrying out the pilot we learned that the feasibility of a Mud Motor depends on an assessment of additional travel time for the dredger, the effectiveness on salt marsh growth, reduced dredging volumes in a port, and many other practical issues. Our improved understanding on the transport processes in the channel and on the mudflats and salt marsh yields design lessons and guiding principles for future applications of sediment management in salt marsh development that include a Mud Motor approach.", "Aluminum- and iron-based coagulation for in-situ removal of dissolved organic carbon, disinfection byproducts, mercury and other constituents from agricultural drain water ": "Agricultural production on wetland soils can be significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), disinfection byproduct precursors, mercury and nutrients to downstream water bodies and accelerate land subsidence. Presented as a potential solution for in-situ water quality improvement and land subsidence mitigation, chemically enhanced treatment wetlands (CETWs) were used to leverage both coagulation and wetland processes. In this study, we evaluated the performance of coagulants ferric sulfate (Fe dosing) and polyaluminum chloride (Al dosing) to remove pollutants from agricultural drain water using the coagulation system designed for CETWs. Both coagulation treatments removed over 70% DOC from source waters, resulting in removal efficiencies (mg-DOC removed per mg-metal dosed) of 1 under Al dosing and 0.5 under Fe dosing. Coagulation by both treatments preferentially removed UV254 active compounds compared to the bulk DOC concentration, suggesting coagulation targeted aromatics more effectively. Phosphates and haloacetic acids were also removed more readily, whereas trihalomethanes, dissolved organic nitrogen and filtered mercury species were removed at similar or lower rates than DOC. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen was not amenable to coagulation and removal was not observed. Freundlich, Langmuir and Monod models explained 33% of the variance in DOC removal for Al dosing and 78\u201389% of the variance for Fe dosing. All three models indicated Al dosing had higher removal efficiency and affinity for DOC than Fe dosing under study conditions, but when used to predict maximum removal efficiency there was no cohesiveness between the three models due to different model assumptions. Consideration of fluorescence dissolved organic matter and UV254 as surrogates for DOC concentration showed both were equally suitable before coagulant application, but as surrogates after coagulant application, neither could be deemed more fit as a surrogate since both were shown suitable for different treatment scenarios.", "Application of bacteria as self-healing agent for the development of sustainable concrete ": "The application of concrete is rapidly increasing worldwide and therefore the development of sustainable concrete is urgently needed for environmental reasons. As presently about 7% of the total anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 emission is due to cement production, mechanisms that would contribute to a longer service life of concrete structures would make the material not only more durable but also more sustainable. One such mechanism that receives increasing attention in recent years is the ability for self-repair, i.e. the autonomous healing of cracks in concrete. In this study we investigated the potential of bacteria to act as self-healing agent in concrete, i.e. their ability to repair occurring cracks. A specific group of alkali-resistant spore-forming bacteria related to the genus Bacillus was selected for this purpose. Bacterial spores directly added to the cement paste mixture remained viable for a period up to 4 months. A continuous decrease in pore size diameter during cement stone setting probably limited life span of spores as pore widths decreased below 1\u03bcm, the typical size of Bacillus spores. However, as bacterial cement stone specimens appeared to produce substantially more crack-plugging minerals than control specimens, the potential application of bacterial spores as self-healing agent appears promising.", "Treatment of aquaculture effluent with Chlorella vulgaris and Tetradesmus obliquus: The effect of pretreatment on microalgae growth and nutrient removal efficiency ": "The ongoing and increasing worldwide demand for fish has caused a steady increase in aquaculture production during the last decades. This emphasizes the importance of farming systems with a low ecological footprint, like recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), which are an alternative to traditional open systems. Furthermore, implementing microalgae treatments in RAS, sustainable water management and low discharge of concentrated wastewater could be achieved, allowing its reuse in the system. The influence of three factors on microalgae treatment efficiency in RAS water were studied: i) microalgae species (Chlorella vulgaris, Tetradesmus obliquus), ii) water pre-treatment (sterile filtration), and iii) sampling location within the RAS (e.g. from fish tank, after UV-disinfection, etc.). To this end, fully factorial, replicated cultivations were carried out in 100-ml flasks, and nutrient removal, microalgae growth, and density of bacteria and protozoa were measured for up to 18\u202fdays. Results show that both species are able to grow in RAS water and effectively remove nutrients in it, yet their performance depended greatly on water quality. In sterile RAS water, growth and nutrient removal efficiency of C. vulgaris surpassed that of T. obliquus. In non-sterile RAS water, the pattern reversed because of grazing protozoa. The location of sampling within the RAS had no discernible effect on microalgae growth or nutrient removal efficiency. The results confirm that a microalgae-based technology to treat and valorise RAS water is technically feasible, yet caution that inferences made can be reversed depending on the choice of the species and the pretreatment of the RAS water prior to cultivation.", "Constructed wetlands for treatment of industrial wastewaters: A review ": "Constructed wetlands have been used for wastewater treatment for more than fifty years. Most applications have been designed to treat municipal or domestic wastewater but at present, constructed wetlands are successfully applied to many types of wastewater. The early constructed wetlands applied to industrial wastewaters included those for wastewaters from petrochemical, abattoir, meat processing, dairy and pulp and paper industries. During the 1990s constructed wetlands were also used to treat effluents from textile and wine industries or water from recirculating fish and shrimp aquacultures. The most recent applications include those for brewery or tannery wastewaters as well as olive mills effluents. The survey revealed that both subsurface and surface flow constructed wetlands have been used for treatment of industrial wastewaters. Within subsurface flow constructed wetlands both horizontal and vertical flow systems have been designed. Also, the use of various hybrid constructed wetlands for industrial effluent treatment has been reported in the literature recently. The survey also revealed that industrial wastewaters are treated in constructed wetlands in all continents and this paper includes the information from 138 constructed wetlands in 33 countries worldwide.", "Mechanistic understanding and holistic approach of phytoremediation: A review on application and future prospects ": "Rapid industrialisation, increased rate of waste production, higher agricultural inputs, mining, industrial waste, and contaminated irrigation water are increasing the heavy metal contamination in agricultural land and freshwater sources. These heavy metals contaminated resources are used by humans for food production that ultimately get accumulated in the food chain. Biomagnification of heavy metals can pose solemn health threats to human life, such as mutations, endocrine disruption, nephro-toxicity, etc. There has long been a need for decontamination of these resources and prevention from the further contamination to avert the negative effects on human health. The \u201cphytoremediation\u201d process is a very promising and eco-friendly approach for heavy metal remediation from contaminated sites with some limitations. An effort has been made to present the scattered information of phytoremediation technique in a single paper through this review. The present review describes the fundamentals of phytoremediation including the different associated processes, mechanism, and influencing factors. The mechanism of tolerance and detoxification of heavy metals by plants has also been discussed in brief. The possible amelioration/modification of a particular phytoremediation strategy has been advocated to increase its potential efficacy and further development of these strategies for future reference. The review tries to cover all the essential and adequate information of the relevant published data with some recent advances in phytoremediation approaches. It is recommended to apply the combination of different available techniques or phytoremediation techniques with modern chemical, biological and genetic engineering tools for an easy and effective decontamination of heavy metals from soil and agricultural land. The review advocates the development of site specific, farmer driven, sequential and phytoremediation strategies along with policy support for effective decontamination.", "Microbial carbonate precipitation in construction materials: A review ": "Evidence of microbial involvement in carbonate precipitation has led to the exploration of this process in the field of construction materials. One of the first patented applications concerned the protection of ornamental stone by means of a microbially deposited carbonate layer, i.e. biodeposition. The promising results of this technique encouraged different research groups to evaluate alternative approaches, each group commenting on the original patent and promoting its bacterial strain or method as the best performing. The goal of this review is to provide an in-depth comparison of these different approaches. Special attention was paid to the research background that could account for the choice of the microorganism and the metabolic pathway proposed. In addition, evaluation of the various methodologies allowed for a clear interpretation of the differences observed in effectiveness. Furthermore, recommendations to improve the in situ feasibility of the biodeposition method are postulated. In the second part of this paper, the use of microbially induced carbonates as a binder material, i.e. biocementation, is discussed. Bacteria have been added to concrete for the improvement of compressive strength and the remediation of cracks. Current studies are evaluating the potential of bacteria as self-healing agents for the autonomous decrease of permeability of concrete upon crack formation.", "Managing environmental contamination through phytoremediation by invasive plants: A review ": "Environmental degradation by contaminants is a serious concern in the developing world. The remediation strategies to overcome the problem of environmental degradation should be assorted for its ecological impacts. Phytoremediation is a green technology for the removal of pollutants from various environmental compartments by employing green plants. An ideal phytoremediation plant candidate should possess some characteristic features such as exhibiting stronger growth traits with high biomass, unpalatable nature, exuberant root system, hyper accumulation of target contaminants accompanied with stress tolerance attributes. The growth of natural vegetation is prevented by the barren and uncongenial conditions prevailing in the contaminated sites, but however invasive plants are capable of establishing themselves on those sites due to their opportunistic incursive nature. Since, it is hard to eradicate an invasive species once after their establishment in a new habitat or ecosystem, they can possibly be controlled by sustainable management through the way of exploiting them in contaminant remediation, thus phytoremediation. Therefore, it is of foremost requisite to determine the ability of invasive species in offering various ecologically viable services including contaminant remediation through scientific exploration. In this review, the implications of using invasive plants in contaminant remediation with accompanying challenges and scopes involved are discussed with the available volume of literatures in contaminant remediation using plants, especially the invasive plants.", "The potential for constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment and reuse in developing countries: a review ": "Constructed wetlands are among the recently proven efficient technologies for wastewater treatment. Compared to conventional treatment systems, constructed wetlands are low cost, are easily operated and maintained, and have a strong potential for application in developing countries, particularly by small rural communities. However, these systems have not found widespread use, due to lack of awareness, and local expertise in developing the technology on a local basis. This paper summarizes information on current methods used for wastewater treatment in developing countries, and briefly gives basic information on wetlands. The paper further examines the potential of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment and reuse in developing countries by looking at the results of current research initiatives towards implementation of the technology in these countries. Future considerations in choosing constructed wetlands as wastewater treating systems in developing countries are highlighted.", "Constructed wetlands for saline wastewater treatment: A review ": "Saline wastewater originating from sources such as agriculture, aquaculture, and many industrial sectors usually contains high salts and other contaminants, which adversely affect both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, the treatment of saline wastewater, for both salts and specific contaminant removal, has become a necessary task in many countries. Conventional methods (e.g., using physicochemical equipment, biological reactors, or a combination thereof) are feasible for treating most saline wastewaters (sometimes only for the removal of contaminants rather than the salts, e.g., biological reactors). However, the high cost of these techniques limits their application in many areas, especially in developing countries. For this reason, constructed wetlands (CWs) have been successfully used for treating a wide variety of wastewaters, and are eco-friendly and cost effective, and provide a potential alternative technology for saline wastewater treatment. The current review illustrates the latest knowledge on the use of CWs for treating saline wastewater. Though the function of plants and microorganisms in CWs is sometimes inhibited by salts, acceptable treatment effectiveness can still be achieved by screening halophyte, optimizing wetland structure and operation parameters, and by exploring the application of halophilic microorganisms. Factors influencing the effectiveness of CWs for saline wastewater treatment include; wetland structures, operation parameters, water pH, and temperature. Future studies are recommended on the removal of different types of target contaminants, strategies for strengthening the purification process, and on conducting large-scale field experiments under real-world conditions.", "Batch kinetics of nitrogen and phosphorus removal from synthetic wastewater by algae ": "Batch experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the initial nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations on nutrient removal performance of microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and to determine biokinetic coefficients such as k; reaction rate constant, K\n                     m, half saturation constant, and Y, yield coefficient by using Michaelis\u2013Menten rate expression. The NH4-N concentration was varied between 13.2\u2013410mgl\u22121 while PO4-P concentration was between 7.7\u2013199mgl\u22121 by keeping N/P ratio around 2/1 in the synthetic wastewater. The experiments were performed at pH 7.0 and at room temperature (20\u00b12\u00b0C) with artificial illumination (4100lux). Experimental results indicated that effluent water quality decreases with increasing nutrient concentrations and algae culture can remove nitrogen more effectively compared to phosphorus. Biokinetic coefficients were determined as k\n                     =1.5mg NH4-N mg\u22121 chl a d\u22121, K\n                     m\n                     =31.5mgl\u22121, Y\n                     N\n                     =0.15mg chl a mg\u22121 NH4-N for nitrogen and k\n                     =0.5mg PO4-P mg\u22121 chl a d\u22121, K\n                     m\n                     =10.5mgl\u22121, Y\n                     P\n                     =0.14mg chl a mg\u22121 PO4-P for phosphorus.", "Bio-mediated soil improvement ": "New, exciting opportunities for utilizing biological processes to modify the engineering properties of the subsurface (e.g. strength, stiffness, permeability) have recently emerged. Enabled by interdisciplinary research at the confluence of microbiology, geochemistry, and civil engineering, this new field has the potential to meet society's ever-expanding needs for innovative treatment processes that improve soil supporting new and existing infrastructure. This paper first presents an overview of bio-mediated improvement systems, identifying the primary components and interplay between different disciplines. Geometric compatibility between soil and microbes that restricts the utility of different systems is identified. Focus is then narrowed to a specific system, namely bio-mediated calcite precipitation of sands. Following an overview of the process, alternative biological processes for inducing calcite precipitation are identified and various microscopy techniques are used to assess how the pore space volume is altered by calcite precipitation, the calcite precipitation is distributed spatially within the pore space, and the precipitated calcite degrades during loading. Non-destructive geophysical process monitoring techniques are described and their utility explored. Next, the extent to which various soil engineering properties is identified through experimental examples. Potential advantages and envisioned applications of bio-mediated soil improvement are identified. Finally, the primary challenges that lie ahead, namely optimization and upscaling of the processes and the education/training of researchers/practitioners are briefly discussed.", "Water retention performance of green roof technology: A comparison of canadian climates ": "In recent decades, urbanization has led to more frequent flood events in urban areas. Several studies have shown the promise of green roof technology for storm water reduction. However, limited studies have assessed water retention performance of green roofs in a range of climates. To investigate the retention performance of a green roof in various Canadian climates, several cities across the country (Vancouver, Calgary, Regina, Toronto, London, and Halifax) were selected. The water balance equation along with evapotranspiration (ET) models were employed to simulate runoff produced by green roofs in these six Canadian cities for two different vegetation types. A seven year simulation period was selected running from 2000 to 2006, with modeling conducted for eight months of the year using hourly time steps. The results showed that the performance of a green roof in runoff reduction depends on location, varying from 17% to 50% for low water use plants. The best performance in storm water reduction was predicted to occur in Regina and Calgary, while the poorest performance was predicted for Halifax and Vancouver. However, the average annual water retention (mm) was the highest in Toronto and London and the lowest in Vancouver, with Calgary, Regina and Halifax showing intermediate performance. Sensitivity analyses were performed for substrate depth, porosity, and wilting point to determine the importance of each for green roof performance for the different cities. The results revealed that the vegetation type had a greater impact on the water retention performance of green roofs than increases in substrate storage capacity associated with different substrate depth, porosity and wilting point over the range assumed in this study.", "Potentialities of floating wetlands for the treatment of polluted water of river Ravi, Pakistan ": "River pollution has become a growing concern in developing countries. It can affect food supplies, drinking water, and environment hence impacting animal and human health. The present study was designed to explore the potential of floating wetlands (FWs) in partnership with pollutant-degrading bacteria for the clean-up of heavily contaminated water of river Ravi at microcosm scale. River Ravi receives excessive discharges of untreated sewage and industrial wastewater from the Lahore city. To this end, FWs are sustainable alternatives to treat wastewater because of their high efficiency and simplicity in the design and structure. Thus, remediation potential of FWs planted with two macrophytes namely Phragmites australis and Brachia mutica was evaluated in the presence of a consortium five different rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria. We found a significant reduction of organic and inorganic pollutants by the application of FWs, whose potential was further boosted by bacterial inoculation. The performance of P. australis was better than B. mutica. Briefly, plant-bacterial synergism for P. australis reduced COD, BOD5, and TOC up to 85.9%, 83.3%, and 86.6% in 96\u202fh, respectively. Total nitrogen was reduced from 37.5 to 2.07\u202fmg\u202fl\u22121, nitrate from 33.3 to 1.23\u202fmg\u202fl\u22121, and phosphorus from 2.63 to 0.53\u202fmg\u202fl\u22121. Trace metals were also reduced up to 79.5% for iron, 91.4% for nickel, 91.8% for manganese, 36.14% for lead, and 85.19% for chromium. The better persistence of inoculated bacteria was tracked in the root/shoot interior of P. australis, which suggest their potential role in improved pollutant reduction. It is thus concluded that bacterial-assisted FWs may be a suitable choice for the remediation of heavily polluted river water. Furthermore, a field-scale application of FWs for the on-site treatment of contaminated water on the Ravi river is recommended.", "Phosphorus recovery and recycling with ecological engineering: A review ": "Phosphorus is essential to life on Earth and frequently limits the productivity of ecosystems, including agroecosystems. Currently, a substantial portion of the global human population relies on finite phosphate rock resources used for chemical fertilizer production. Concern over poor management of these vital resources and continued efforts to enhance soil fertility and food security have stimulated interest in phosphorus recovery and recycling. Existing heterogeneity in phosphorus waste flows, agricultural phosphorus needs, the availability of resources, and spatial patterns of land use calls for a diverse array of phosphorus recycling strategies. Ecological engineers working on phosphorus management have most commonly aimed to create phosphorus sinks on the landscape to help mitigate eutrophication. There is a growing need for ecological engineering approaches that go beyond phosphorus retention to create pathways for phosphorus recovery and recycling, supporting both eutrophication control and food security. This review includes a brief overview of human impacts on the global phosphorus cycle and a survey of existing ecological engineering techniques for phosphorus recovery and recycling discussed in the literature. A systems approach for design and feasibility assessment of phosphorus recycling with eco-technology is outlined, along with several key challenges. The importance of an interdisciplinary, multiple element, and multiple resource approach to phosphorus recycling is emphasized.", "Potential of using green adsorbent of heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions: Adsorption kinetics, isotherm, thermodynamic, mechanism and economic analysis ": "Peanut hull is a local natural abundant agricultural waste in Egypt. The peanut hull was used as an adsorbent without any chemical or physical treatment for copper ions Cu(II) removal from aqueous solutions. Effects of various parameters such as contact time, particle size and dosage of adsorbent, initial pH, solution temperature, and initial concentration of Cu(II) were investigated for a batch adsorption system.The optimum operating conditions were (1h, 150rpm shaking speed, 25\u00b0C, pH=4, 1g peanut hulls of particle size<250\u03bcm/50ml of 150ppm cupper ions solution concentration). The maximum adsorption capacity was 14.13mg/g peanut hulls. Several kinetic models have been investigated to recognize the cupper ions adsorption mechanism onto peanut hulls. The results showed that the adsorption process obeyed the pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion kinetic models, pointing that the adsorption mechanism is chemical and physical adsorption process. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms have been investigated. The thermodynamic parameters have been studied, and it proved that, adsorption of Cu(II) using peanut hulls is endothermic and nonspontaneous. This study convinced that the naturally peanut hulls proved to be an alternative, attractive, effective, economic, and environmentally friendly adsorbent for Cu(II) removal from aqueous solution.", "Bioremediation of heavy metals by using bacterial mixtures ": "Environmental pollution by heavy and toxic metals because of mining, metallurgic processes, and other chemical industries is a worldwide problem affecting both human health and the environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of bacterial mixtures on the bioremediation of a mixture of Pb, Cd, and Cu from contaminated soils. Compared to the single culture method, the bacterial mixtures showed higher growth rate, urease activity, and resistance to heavy metals. Four bacterial strains were isolated and identified from bacterial mixtures\u2014Viridibacillus arenosi B-21, Sporosarcina soli B-22, Enterobacter cloacae KJ-46, and E. cloacae KJ-47, which obtained from an abandoned mine site in Korea and showed effective microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP). The following parameters were monitored during the course of the experiment: optical density, pH, urease activity, calcite production, tolreance to heavy metals, and impermeability test. Synergistic effects on the remediation of various heavy metals via modification of the bacterial mixtures were observed and, after 48h, remediation of 98.3% for Pb, 85.4% for Cd, and 5.6% for Cu were recorded. Compared with single strain cultures, the bacterial mixtures demonstrated greater resistance and efficiency for the remediation of heavy metals. Thus, our results show that the use of bacterial mixtures is useful in the bioremediation of heavy metals from the contaminated environment.", "Effect of plant physiological characteristics on the removal of conventional and emerging pollutants from aquaculture wastewater by constructed wetlands ": "Four horizontal subsurface flow pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) named as S1, S2, M1 and M2 were constructed to treat aquaculture wastewater. And two different plant species (Iris pseudacorus and Phragmites australis) were cultivated in single and mixed planting patterns in these four CWs. The removal rate of conventional pollutants (nutrient and organic compounds), antibiotics including enrofloxacin (ENR), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were evaluated among those CWs. The total nitrogen and NH4\n                     +\u2013N removal rates of all CWs were 73.24%\u201391.46% and 61.20%\u201392.27%, respectively. CWs with mixed planting patterns, such as M1 (planted with Iris pseudacorus at the forepart and Phragmites australis at the back) and M2 (alternate cultivation with Iris pseudacorus and Phragmites australis) showed better performances than CWs planted with single plant species, such as S1 (Iris pseudacorus) and S2 (Phragmites australis). However, S1 and S2 exhibited higher removal efficiencies for emerging contaminants: S1 had removal efficiencies of 77.64%, 68.70%, and 58.21% for ENR, SMZ, and total ARGs, respectively, and S2 had removal efficiencies of 81.11%, 64.94%, and 56.26% for ENR, SMZ, and total ARGs, respectively. Compared with single planting, the dominant genera in mixed planting exhibited lower relative abundance in anaerobes and higher percent of bacteria associated with nitrogen metabolism, indicating that different plant physiological characteristics affected the microbial community structures of the CWs.", "Quantitative response of nitrogen dynamic processes to functional gene abundances in a pond-ditch circulation system for rural wastewater treatment ": "The pond-ditch circulation system (PDCS) is a promising solution for the restoration of rural wastewater. However, the underlying nitrogen removal mechanisms and roles of functional genes in nitrogen transformation processes have not yet been quantified at the molecular level. In this study, PDCSs have been found to have high removal efficiencies when the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) was high (>70%; 62.7\u201393.9%, respectively). Meanwhile, the presence of simultaneous nitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and denitrification processes were the primary nitrogen removal mechanisms in the PDCSs. According to the stepwise regression analysis and path analysis, two key functional gene groups, nosZ/(nirS\u202f+\u202fnirK) and (nxrA/amoA), were driving these major processes for TN and ammonia nitrogen (NH4\n                     +-N), respectively. Moreover, the key functional gene group narG/nxrA was affecting processes related to nitrate-nitrogen (NO3\n                     \u2212-N) and nitrite-nitrogen (NO2\n                     \u2212-N) conversion. Furthermore, results from the 15N isotope pairing technique suggested that for PDCSs, anammox was mainly responsible for nitrogen removal due to its high contribution to total N2 production (50.3%) in the ditch; denitrification, on the other hand, was primarily attributed to nitrogen removal, rather than the anammox process, in two ponds (41.3\u201343.1%).", "Scaling of the reinforcement of soil slopes by living plants in a geotechnical centrifuge ": "Understanding root-reinforcement of vegetated slopes is hindered by the cost and practicality of full scale tests to explore global behaviour at the slope scale, and the idealised nature of smaller-scale testing to date that has relied on model root analogues. In this study we investigated the potential to use living plant roots in small scale experiments of slope failure that would use a geotechnical centrifuge to achieve soil stress states comparable to those in the field at homologous points. Three species (Willow, Gorse and Festulolium grass), corresponding to distinct plant groups with different root architecture and \u2018woodiness\u2019 were selected and cultivated for short periods (2 months for Willow and Festulolium grass, 3 months for Gorse). The morphologies, tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus of these juvenile root samples and their effects on increasing soil shear strength were then measured (via tensile tests and direct shear tests) and compared with published results of more mature field grown specimens. Our test results show that when all juvenile root samples of the three species are considered, the commonly used negative power law does not fit the data for the relationship between root tensile strength and root diameter well, resulting in very low R2 values (R2\n                     <0.14). No significant differences in tensile strength were observed between roots with different diameter for Willow and Gorse, and the average root tensile strength for all juvenile root samples was 8.70\u00b10.60MPa (Mean\u00b1SE), 9.50\u00b10.40MPa, 21.67\u00b11.29MPa for Willow, Festulolium grass and Gorse, respectively. However, a strong linear relationship was observed between tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus of the roots of the juvenile plants (R2\n                     =0.55, 0.69, 0.50 for Willow, Festulolium grass and Gorse, respectively). From a centrifuge modelling perspective, it was shown that using juvenile plants could potentially produce prototype root systems that are highly representative of corresponding mature root systems both in terms of root mechanical properties and root morphology when a suitable growing time (2 months) and scaling factor (N\n                     =15) are selected. However, it remains a challenge to simultaneously simulate the distribution of root biomass with depth of the corresponding mature plant. Therefore, a compromise has to made to resolve the conflicts between the scaling of rooting depth and root reinforcement, and it is suggested that 1:15 scale would represent a suitable compromise for studying slope failure in a geotechnical centrifuge.", "Warning systems triggered by trains could reduce collisions with wildlife ": "Ecosystems are degraded by transportation infrastructure partly because wildlife mortality from collisions with vehicles can threaten the viability of sensitive populations and alter ecosystem dynamics. This problem has attracted extensive study and mitigation on roads, but little similar work has been done for railways despite the occurrence of wildlife\u2013train collisions worldwide. We propose a method for reducing wildlife losses on railways by providing animals with warning signals that are triggered by approaching trains, particularly in areas of high strike risk. Analogous to the warning signals provided for people at road\u2013rail crossings, our system emits flashes of light and bell sounds approximately 20s before train arrival at the location where the system is deployed. Learning theory predicts that animals will associate these warning signals with train arrival if the warning signal (conditioned stimulus) consistently precedes train arrival (unconditioned stimulus). We tested two designs for a warning system: one that detects passing trains and wirelessly relays this information to warning devices further along the track, and one that integrates detection of trains at a distance with warning signals in a single device. The most reliable design detected passing trains with magnetic or vibration sensors and relayed the information to warning devices. We have developed an affordable and publicly available prototype of this design that can be built for a material cost of US$225. With refinement, this technology could become an inexpensive means of protecting wildlife and people around the world from fatal train strikes wherever strike risk is known or predicted to be unusually high.", "A feasibility assessment of an integrated plastic waste system adopting mechanical and thermochemical conversion processes ": "The large variety and amounts of plastic waste produced worldwide requires to better organize the industrial network devoted to the exploitation of this material by including different processes that allow to recover the \u201cmaterial\u201d as main target. This paper presents the results of the feasibility study developed for an integrated system for plastic waste management designed in such a way to deal with the real market and provide for reliable targets in term of material recovery yields, energy efficiency and waste minimization. The system under study is a combination of mechanical sorting, thermochemical processes and conversion into materials and energy. The quantified block diagrams are used to represent the mass and feedstock energy balances by allowing the calculation of yields of given products. The equipment list for each sub-system is provided together with the installed power for the main component and/or auxiliary; these data allowed to perform the energy balance and to obtain the net energy production by the integrated system. The energy balance demonstrated that the integrated system is feasible while, on the contrary, the single processes are not energetic self-sustainable.", "Upcycling food waste digestate for energy and heavy metal remediation applications ": "Anaerobic digestate originating from food waste has been studied herein for two different purposes. Firstly, for combustion, co-granulation of the digestate and medium density fibreboard (MDF) dust with the addition of sodium silicate as the binder was used to produce the granular solid biofuel. It was found that increasing the content of the medium density fibreboard dust could increase the calorific value but had no significant effect on the strength of the final granules. Additionally, a significant reduction of the ash content was also observed. For heavy metal removal, granules made using the digestate and sodium silicate binder were carbonised to produce biochar which was characterised and applied as adsorbent materials. The biochar has a good removal capacity for both lead and cadmium, and the binder concentration had a positive correlation with the removal capacity of the resultant biochar. The maximum lead removal capacity (355.3mgg\u22121) of biochar made using 3wt.% sodium silicate binder, was six times more than the analogous commercial activated carbon. Langmuir model showed better fitting for adsorption data of Pb2+, while the Freundlich model showed better fitting of Cd2+. For both Pb2+ and Cd2+ kinetic data, the pseudo-second-order had a better correlation. Our approach helps aid and facilitate the concept of the circular economy by effectively up-cycling and valorising waste lignocellulosic biomass such as food waste digestate into value-added products.", "Restoring nutrient circularity: A review of nutrient stock and flow analyses of local agro-food-waste systems ": "To reduce environmental issues resulting from excess nutrients, conserve valuable resources and safeguard future food security, natural nutrient cycles in agro-food-waste systems need to be restored. To this end, nutrient stock and flow analyses of the agro-food-waste system can be undertaken. There is currently no standardized method for the systematic analysis of nutrient stocks and flows to support nutrient circularity of those systems at a local scale. This review of 57 studies summarizes the current knowledge on nutrient stock and flow analysis of agro-food-waste systems in local areas and proposes a six-step framework. About a third of the reviewed studies analyzed the complete agro-food-waste system, including crop production, animal production, food and feed processing industry, consumption and waste management. Furthermore, the main focus tends to be on phosphorus (P), and to a lesser extent on nitrogen (N), potassium (K) and (organic) carbon (C). Only a few studies combined the analyses of different nutrients, even though nutrient use efficiency relies on obtaining the optimal stoichiometric balance. The proposed framework for nutrient stock and flow analyses encompasses the inclusion of the complete agro-food-waste system and simultaneous analysis of N, P, K and C to facilitate assessment of the full potential to restore local nutrient circularity. Moreover, the local study area needs to be sufficiently large to include all the subsystems and sufficiently small to facilitate transportation of nutrients. Following this six-step framework, analyses will be able to identify hotspots, based on which effective measures to restore local nutrient circularity can be developed.", "Plastic debris in the Laurentian Great Lakes: A review ": "Pollution by plastic debris is an increasing environmental concern in the Laurentian Great Lakes where it affects open-water, shoreline, and benthic environments. Open-water surveys reveal that, in certain areas of the Great Lakes, surface water densities of plastics are as high as those reported for areas of litter accumulation within oceanic gyres. Data from volunteer beach cleanups show that typically more than 80% of anthropogenic litter along the shorelines of the Great Lakes is comprised of plastics. The distribution of plastics in bottom sediments of the Great Lakes is essentially unknown. Sources of plastic debris to the Great Lakes include microplastic beads from consumer products, pellets from the plastic manufacturing industry, and waste from beach-goers, shipping, and fishing activities. Many plastics degrade slowly in the environment and may have long-term adverse ecological and economic impacts, including the dispersal of persistent organic pollutants. Plans to combat and curtail plastic debris pollution in the Great Lakes will come at a significant economic cost, likely in excess of $400 million annually. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on plastic pollution in the Great Lakes, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest future research directions.", "The taxonomic diversity of the cichlid fish fauna of ancient Lake Tanganyika, East Africa ": "Ancient Lake Tanganyika in East Africa houses the world's ecologically and morphologically most diverse assemblage of cichlid fishes, and the third most species-rich after lakes Malawi and Victoria. Despite long-lasting scientific interest in the cichlid species flocks of the East African Great Lakes, for example in the context of adaptive radiation and explosive diversification, their taxonomy and systematics are only partially explored; and many cichlid species still await their formal description. Here, we provide a current inventory of the cichlid fish fauna of Lake Tanganyika, providing a complete list of all valid 208 Tanganyikan cichlid species, and discuss the taxonomic status of more than 50 undescribed taxa on the basis of the available literature as well as our own observations and collections around the lake. This leads us to conclude that there are at least 241 cichlid species present in Lake Tanganyika, all but two are endemic to the basin. We finally summarize some of the major taxonomic challenges regarding Lake Tanganyika's cichlid fauna. The taxonomic inventory of the cichlid fauna of Lake Tanganyika presented here will facilitate future research on the taxonomy and systematics and the ecology and evolution of the species flock, as well as its conservation.", "Unmanned aerial system based spectroradiometer for monitoring harmful algal blooms: A new paradigm in water quality monitoring ": "Water quality issues continue to impact recreational and resource use of waterways in the Great Lakes and across smaller inland water bodies in their watersheds. With the advancements in small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and in small sensor production, sUAS offer flexibility to overcome several of the shortcomings of satellite and airborne systems, and complement their measurements in this environment. In this study, we deployed two different low-cost, boat launchable sUAS configurations instrumented with Ocean Optics STS hyperspectral Vis-NIR spectroradiometers capable of making measurements over an approximately 2.5\u202fkm2 area, below the cloud deck in the nearshore and open lake environment. Flights of these systems were conducted at ten locations over Lake Erie and the Maumee River. Measured spectra compared well with at-surface based Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) Fieldspec measured spectra, and derived parameters were consistent with in-water FluoroProbe measured water quality parameters and field observations. Using flight data, we constructed transect maps of derived CI products which show the variability in algae abundance in open water. These systems provide high quality, low cost, very high spatial resolution (cm to m scale measurements) hyperspectral data in the nearshore environment, can be consistently flown at low altitude (minimizing atmospheric effects) below cloud cover and can be deployed on extremely short notice. With the continued advancement in sensor development, automated flight capabilities, and increased flight duration from vertical take off and landing (VTOL) platforms, water quality observation platforms such as these will soon be a common tool in resource manager's toolboxes.", "Assessing and addressing the re-eutrophication of Lake Erie: Central basin hypoxia ": "Relieving phosphorus loading is a key management tool for controlling Lake Erie eutrophication. During the 1960s and 1970s, increased phosphorus inputs degraded water quality and reduced central basin hypolimnetic oxygen levels which, in turn, eliminated thermal habitat vital to cold-water organisms and contributed to the extirpation of important benthic macroinvertebrate prey species for fishes. In response to load reductions initiated in 1972, Lake Erie responded quickly with reduced water-column phosphorus concentrations, phytoplankton biomass, and bottom-water hypoxia (dissolved oxygen <2mg/l). Since the mid-1990s, cyanobacteria blooms increased and extensive hypoxia and benthic algae returned. We synthesize recent research leading to guidance for addressing this re-eutrophication, with particular emphasis on central basin hypoxia. We document recent trends in key eutrophication-related properties, assess their likely ecological impacts, and develop load response curves to guide revised hypoxia-based loading targets called for in the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Reducing central basin hypoxic area to levels observed in the early 1990s (ca. 2000km2) requires cutting total phosphorus loads by 46% from the 2003\u20132011 average or reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus loads by 78% from the 2005\u20132011 average. Reductions to these levels are also protective of fish habitat. We provide potential approaches for achieving those new loading targets, and suggest that recent load reduction recommendations focused on western basin cyanobacteria blooms may not be sufficient to reduce central basin hypoxia to 2000km2.", "Water level fluctuations and the ecosystem functioning of lakes ": "Hydrological regimes are key drivers of productivity and structure in freshwater ecosystems but are increasingly impacted by human activity. Using 17 published food web models of 13 African lakes as a case study, we explored relationships between seasonal and interannual water level fluctuations and 15 attributes related to ecosystem function. We interpreted our results in the context of Odum's ecosystem maturity hypothesis, as systems with higher magnitude fluctuations may be kept at an earlier maturity stage than those that are relatively stable. The data we compiled indicate that long-term changes in the hydrological regimes of African lakes have already taken place. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to examine relationships between ecosystem attributes and seven physical characteristics. Of these characteristics, interannual water level fluctuation magnitude was the most frequently retained predictor in the regression models. Our results indicate that interannual water level fluctuations are positively correlated with primary and overall production, but negatively correlated with fish diversity, transfer efficiency, and food chain length. These trends are opposite those expected with increasing ecosystem maturity. Interestingly, we found seasonal water level fluctuations to be positively correlated with biomass. An increase in standing biomass is generally associated with more mature ecosystems. However, we found that less production and biomass occurred at high trophic levels in highly fluctuating compared to relatively stable systems. This synthesis provides evidence that water level fluctuations are a key process influencing ecosystem structure and function in lakes.", "Satellite monitoring of harmful algal blooms in the Western Basin of Lake Erie: A 20-year time-series ": "Blooms of harmful cyanobacteria (cyanoHABs) have occurred on an annual basis in western Lake Erie for more than a decade. Previously, we developed and validated an algorithm to map the extent of the submerged and surface scum components of cyanoHABs using MODIS ocean-color satellite data. The algorithm maps submerged cyanoHABs by identifying high chlorophyll concentrations (>18\u202fmg/m3) combined with water temperature >20\u202f\u00b0C, while cyanoHABs surface scums are mapped using near-infrared reflectance values. Here, we adapted this algorithm for the SeaWiFS sensor to map the annual areal extents of cyanoHABs in the Western Basin of Lake Erie for the 20-year period from 1998 to 2017. The resulting classified maps were validated by comparison with historical in situ measurements, exhibiting good agreement (81% accuracy). Trends in the annual mean and maximum total submerged and surface scum extents demonstrated significant positive increases from 1998 to 2017. There was also an apparent 76% increase in year-to-year variability of mean annual extent between the 1998\u20132010 and 2011\u20132017 periods. The 1998\u20132017 time-series was also compared with several different river discharge nutrient loading metrics to assess the ability to predict annual cyanoHAB extents. The prediction models displayed significant relationships between spring discharge and cyanoHAB area; however, substantial variance remained unexplained due in part to the presence of very large blooms occurring in 2013 and 2015. This new multi-sensor time-series and associated statistics extend the current understanding of the extent, location, duration, and temporal patterns of cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie.", "Validation of 2015 Lake Erie MODIS image spectral decomposition using visible derivative spectroscopy and field campaign data ": "Timely identification of color-producing agents (CPAs) in Lake Erie is a challenging, but vital aspect of monitoring harmful algal blooms (HABs). In particular, HABs that include large amounts of cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs) can be toxic to humans, posing a threat to drinking water, in addition to recreational and economic use of Lake Erie. The optical signal of Lake Erie is complex (Becker et al., 2009; Moore et al., 2017), typically comprised of phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), detritus, and terrigenous inorganic particles, varying in composition both spatially and temporally. The Kent State University (KSU) spectral decomposition method effectively partitions CPAs using a varimax-rotated, principal component analysis (VPCA) of visible reflectance spectra measured using lab, field or satellite instruments (Ali et al., 2013; Ortiz et al., 2017, 2013). We analyze 2015 imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and field samples collected during the early 2015 cyanoHAB season. We identified four primary CPA spectral signatures, and the spatial distribution of each identified CPA, in the reflectance spectra datasets of both the MODIS and lab-measured water samples. The KSU spectral decomposition method results in mixtures of specific pigments, pigment degradation products, and minerals that describe the optically complex water. We found very good agreement between the KSU VPCA spectral decomposition results and in situ measurements, indicating that this method may be a powerful tool for rapid CyanoHAB monitoring and assessment in large lakes using instruments that provide moderate resolution imagery (0.3 to 1\u202fkm2).", "The impact of phytoplankton community composition on optical properties and satellite observations of the 2017 western Lake Erie algal bloom ": "Since the early 2000s Lake Erie has seen a dramatic increase in phytoplankton biomass, manifested in particular by the rise in the severity of cyanobacteria blooms and the prevalence of potentially toxic taxa such as Microcystis. Satellite remote sensing has provided a unique capacity for the synoptic detection of these blooms, enabling spatial and temporal trends in their extent and severity to be documented. Algorithms for satellite detection of Lake Erie algal blooms often rely on a single consistent relationship between algal or cyanobacterial biomass and spectral indices such as the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) or Cyanobacteria Index (CI). Blooms, however, are known to vary significantly in community composition over space and time. A suite of phytoplankton and optical property measurements during the western Lake Erie algal bloom of 2017 showed highly diverse bloom composition with variable absorption and backscatter properties. Elevated backscattering coefficients were observed in the Maumee Bay, likely due to phytoplankton cell morphology and buoyancy regulating gas vacuoles, compared with typically Planktothrix dominated blooms in Sandusky Bay. MCI and CI calibrated to historical chlorophyll observations and applied to Sentinel 3's OLCI sensor accurately captured the 2017 bloom in Maumee Bay but underestimated the Sandusky Bay bloom by nearly 80%. The phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria Aphanothece and Synechococcus were found in abundance throughout the western and central basins, resulting in substantial biomass underestimations using blue to green ratio-based algorithms. Potential misrepresentation of bloom severity resulting from phytoplankton optical properties should be considered in assessments of bloom conditions on Lake Erie.", "Spatial and temporal variability of inherent and apparent optical properties in western Lake Erie: Implications for water quality remote sensing ": "Lake Erie has experienced dramatic changes in water quality over the past several decades requiring extensive monitoring to assess effectiveness of adaptive management strategies. Remote sensing offers a unique potential to provide synoptic monitoring at daily time scales complementing in-situ sampling activities occurring in Lake Erie. Bio-optical remote sensing algorithms require knowledge about the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the water for parameterization to produce robust water quality products. This study reports new IOP and apparent optical property (AOP) datasets for western Lake Erie that encapsulate the May\u2013October period for 2015 and 2016 at weekly sampling intervals. Previously reported IOP and AOP observations have been temporally limited and have not assessed statistical differences between IOPs over spatial and temporal gradients. The objective of this study is to assess trends in IOPs over variable spatial and temporal scales. Large spatio-temporal variability in IOPs was observed between 2015 and 2016 likely due to the difference in the extent and duration of mid-summer cyanobacteria blooms. Differences in the seasonal trends of the specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient between 2015 and 2016 suggest differing algal assemblages between the years. Other IOP variables, including chromophoric, dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and beam attenuation spectral slopes, suggest variability is influenced by river discharge and sediment re-suspension. The datasets presented in this study show how these IOPs and AOPs change over a season and between years, and are useful in advancing the applicability and robustness of remote sensing methods to retrieve water quality information in western Lake Erie.", "Challenges in tracking harmful algal blooms: A synthesis of evidence from Lake Erie ": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are becoming increasingly common in freshwater ecosystems globally, raising complex questions about the factors that influence their initiation and growth. These questions have increasingly been answered through mechanistic and stochastic modeling efforts that rely on historical information about HABs in a given system for development, validation, and calibration. Therefore, understanding processes that control HABs is predicated on the ability to answer much more basic questions about what has actually occurred in a given system, namely questions of HAB occurrence, extent, intensity, and timing. Here we explore the state of the science in answering these basic questions; we use Lake Erie as a case study, where nearly two decades after the resurgence of HABs, a summer 2014 event caused a mandatory three day tap water ban for Toledo, Ohio. We find that, even for well-studied systems, unambiguous answers to basic questions about HAB occurrence are lacking, raising concerns about their use as a basis for addressing mechanistic questions about controlling factors. This ambiguity is found to be caused by differences in the methods used to track HABs, the specific harm being considered, the linkage to that harm (direct or indirect), the threshold defining harm, and spatiotemporal variability in sampling. Further work is therefore needed to integrate heterogeneous types of observations in order to better leverage existing and future monitoring programs, and to guide modeling efforts toward deeper understanding of HAB causes and consequences.", "Determining remote sensing spatial resolution requirements for the monitoring of harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes ": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a major health and environmental concern in the Great Lakes. In 2014, severe HABs prompted the State of Ohio to request NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) to assist with monitoring algal blooms in Lake Erie. The most notable species of HAB is Microcystis aeruginosa, a hepatotoxin producing cyanobacteria that is responsible for liver complications for humans and other fauna that come in contact with these blooms. NASA GRC conducts semiweekly flights in order to gather up-to-date imagery regarding the blooms' spatial extents and concentrations. Airborne hyperspectral imagery is collected using two hyperspectral imagers, HSI-2 and HSI-3. Hyperspectral imagery is necessary in order to conduct experiments on differentiation of algal bloom types based on their spectral reflectance. In this analysis, imagery from September 19, 2016 was utilized to study the subpixel variability within the footprint of arbitrary sized pixels using several analysis techniques. This particular data set is utilized because it represents a worst case scenario where there is significant potential for public health concern due to high concentrations of microcystin toxin found in the water on this day and the concurrent observational challenges to accurately measure the algal bloom concentration variability with a remote sensing system due to the blooms high spatial variability. It has been determined that the optimal spatial resolution to monitor algal blooms in the Great Lakes is at most 50\u202fm, and for much lower error 25\u202fm, thus allowing for greater ease in identifying high concentration blooms near the surface. This resolution provides the best sensitivity to high concentration areas that are of significant importance in regard to human health and ecological damage.", "Algal bloom transport in Lake Erie using remote sensing and hydrodynamic modelling: Sensitivity to buoyancy velocity and initial vertical distribution ": "In this study, we simulate three-dimensional transport of algal blooms in Lake Erie using a combination of remote sensing and hydrodynamic modelling. The remote sensing algorithms use data from the Sentinel-3 OLCI satellite sensor to derive chlorophyll-a concentration from cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Erie. The derived chlorophyll-a concentration initializes an algal bloom transport model driven by the lake component of the Water Cycle Prediction System for the Great Lakes, a system of coupled atmosphere-lake-hydrological models operated out of Environment and Climate Change Canada. The bloom is modelled as Microcystis aeruginosa, a buoyant species that is often dominant in harmful algal blooms in western Lake Erie. Short-term (a few days) predictions of algal bloom transport from July 27 to October 8, 2017 are modelled in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks. The Eulerian framework is used to evaluate the sensitivity of model results to the initial vertical distribution of the bloom. In this work, the Lagrangian framework is limited to two-dimensional surface confined particles. We use several error metrics to evaluate model predictions. We find that results are sensitive to the buoyancy velocity for cases where the bloom was initially distributed over a large portion of the water column. An initial vertical distribution selected from modelled chlorophyll-a half depth shows the highest accuracy for the entire range of buoyancy velocities tested. We also find that the Pierce skill score is difficult to interpret, particularly in cases where bloom intensity is greatly overpredicted by the model.", "Assessment of site-specific agricultural Best Management Practices in the Upper East River watershed, Wisconsin, using a field-scale SWAT model ": "The Great Lakes \u201cPriority Watershed\u201d effort targeted the Upper East River watershed, a 116.5-km2 tributary watershed to Wisconsin's Green Bay, to reduce its sediment and nutrients loads from agricultural sources. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was created to determine the effectiveness of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) funded through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The model was calibrated at the monthly time-step for flow, sediment, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate, and total nitrogen (TN). Field- and watershed-scale sediment and nutrient reductions were calculated due to the implementation of 74 BMP combinations on dairy and cash grain rotations. Modeling results indicated that when multiple BMPs were placed on a field, especially those including filter strips and grassed waterways, sediment and nutrient loads generally were reduced more than single BMP implementation. The most effective in-field practice at reducing DRP and TP on dairy fields was a combination of 5 different BMPs: cover crops, crop rotation, nutrient management plan, reduced tillage, and a filter strip. Conservation cover was the single most effective practice at reducing sediment and nutrient yields. Sediment and nutrient loads decreased at the watershed scale as the quantity and coverage of BMPs increased. When all contracted BMPs were simulated at the watershed scale, sediment loads were reduced 2%, while TP, DRP, TN and nitrate loads were reduced 20%, 9%, 24%, and 17%, respectively. Modeling scenarios also indicated that over-winter manure storage was important to keep soluble nutrients out of waterways.", "An analysis of satellite-derived chlorophyll and algal bloom indices on Lake Winnipeg ": "Lake Winnipeg has experienced dramatic increases in nutrient loading and phytoplankton biomass over the last few decades, accompanied by a marked shift in community composition towards the dominance of cyanobacteria. Comprehensive lake-wide observations of algal blooms are critical to assessing the lake's health status, its response to nutrient management practices, and an improved understanding of the processes driving blooms. We present an analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of algal blooms on Lake Winnipeg using satellite-derived chlorophyll and indices for algal bloom intensity, spatial extent, severity, and duration over the period of ESA's MERIS mission (2002\u20132011). Imagery documented extensive blooms covering as much as 93% of the lake surface. Bloom conditions were analysed in the context of in-lake and watershed processes to gain further insight on the drivers of bloom events. Day to day bloom variability was driven primarily by intermittent wind mixing events, with quiescent periods leading to the formation of dense surface blooms. Seasonal bloom distribution was consistent with light limitation in the south basin and lake circulation transporting bloom material towards the north-east shore. Inter-annual variability in average bloom severity was related to both total phosphorus (TP) loadings and summer lake surface temperatures. Results provide a valuable historical time series of bloom conditions to which ongoing observations from Sentinel-3's OLCI sensor can be added for longer term monitoring and change detection.", "Spatial and temporal scales of variability of cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms from NOAA GLERL airborne hyperspectral imagery ": "NOAA GLERL has routinely flown a hyperspectral imager to detect cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) over the Great Lakes since 2015. Three consecutive years of hyperspectral imagery over the Great Lakes warn drinking water intake managers of the presence of cyanoHABs. Western basin imagery of Lake Erie contributes to a weekly report to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency using the cyanobacteria index (CI) as an indicator of the presence of cyanoHABs. The CI is also used for the weekly NOAA NCCOS cyanoHAB Lake Erie bulletin applied to satellite data. To date, there has not been a sensor comparison to look at the variability between the satellite and hyperspectral imagery on a pixel-by-pixel basis, as well as a time scale comparison between measurements from buoys and shipboard surveys. The spatial scale is a measure of size of a cyanobacteria bloom on a scale of meters to kilometers. The change in the spatial scale or spatial variability has been quantified from satellite and airborne imagery using a decorrelation scale analysis to find the point at which the values are not changing or are not correlated with each other. The decorrelation scales were also applied to the buoy and shipboard survey data to look at temporal scales or changes in time on hourly to daytime scales for blue-green algae, chlorophyll and temperature. These scales are valuable for ecosystem modelers and for those initiating sampling efforts to optimize sampling plans and to infer a potential mechanism in an observational study from a synoptic viewpoint.", "Total and soluble reactive phosphorus loadings to Lake Erie A detailed accounting by year, basin, country, and tributary": "Information about the loads of total and soluble reactive phosphorus entering Lake Erie is required in order to support commitments made under Annex 4 of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. For these purposes, annual (water year) total phosphorus loads to Lake Erie are updated (2003\u20132013) and soluble reactive loads are reported on a lakewide basis for the first time (2009\u20132013). Complete documentation including input data and error estimates are provided. The results confirm previously documented long-term declining TP loads and show how these are driven by early and recent improvements in point source discharges, but are confounded by recent increases in nonpoint source loads that may in turn be due to increasing trends in precipitation and river discharge. The record since 2009 for SRP indicates high interannual variability and no discernible change in loadings over time. Recent TP loads are dominated by nonpoint sources (71%), with lower contributions from point sources (19%) and the balance comprising atmospheric deposition and loads from the upstream Great Lakes. Approximately one-half (49%) of the load of SRP is contributed from nonpoint sources, approximately 39% comprises point sources, and atmospheric deposition and upstream loads comprise 6% each. Loads are highest to the western basin for TP and highest to the Huron\u2013Erie corridor for SRP. U.S. sources account for a majority (>80%) of the phosphorus loads entering the lake. Recommendations for improvements to the study approach are made including the identification of monitoring gaps and the testing of assumptions that require independent verification.", "Variation in the essential fatty acids EPA and DHA in fillets of fish from the Great Lakes region ": "This dataset represents the largest collection of fatty acid data from the Great Lakes region to date, summarizing concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in fish sampled from the U.S. waters of all 5 Great Lakes and 92 U.S. lakes and rivers. Determining how freshwater fishes' fatty acid content varies across environmental gradients is important in understanding aquatic trophic interactions and to providing comprehensive fish consumption advice. However, there is currently a lack of information on variation in freshwater fish fatty acid content that may hinder human health and fisheries professionals tasked with establishing fish monitoring and analysis programs which capture this variability. To that end, fillet EPA+DHA concentrations were modeled over several biotic and abiotic gradients in order to constrain variability. Recommendations based on model results are then used to suggest starting points for planning future fish sampling efforts (e.g. inland walleye [EPA+DHA] varied with both length and waterbody eutrophication; these gradients should be incorporated into sampling efforts to capture walleye [EPA+DHA] variability). In terms of nutrition, Great Lakes species (all taxonomic families) and inland salmonid fillets contained a daily adequate intake (AI) level of \u2265250mg of EPA+DHA per 8-oz. (227g) fillet, but other taxonomic families from inland waters generally did not. Very few species' fillets, regardless of sampling location or taxonomic family, contained the equivalent weekly AI level of 1750mg EPA+DHA per 8-oz. fillet. The data presented here can inform both fish sampling efforts and fish consumption risk-benefit analyses.", "Tracking changes in nutrient delivery to western Lake Erie: Approaches to compensate for variability and trends in streamflow ": "Tracking changes in stream nutrient inputs to Lake Erie over multidecadal time scales depends on the use of statistical methods that can remove the influence of year-to-year variability of streamflow but also explicitly consider the influence of long-term trends in streamflow. The methods introduced in this paper include an extended version of Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) modeling that explicitly considers nonstationary streamflow by incorporating information on changes in the frequency distribution of daily measured streamflow (discharge) over time. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) trends in annual flow-normalized fluxes (loads) at five long-term monitoring sites in the western Lake Erie drainage basin show increases of 109 to 322% over the period 1995 to 2015. About one-third of the increase appears attributable to increasing discharge trends, while the remaining two-thirds appears to be driven by changes in concentration versus discharge relationships reflecting higher concentrations for any given discharge during recent years. Trends in total phosphorus and three nitrogen parameters (total nitrogen, nitrate-nitrite, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen) at the 10 sites analyzed were much less pronounced, and commonly show decreases in concentration-discharge relationships accompanied by increases in discharge, resulting in little net change in total flux. Trends in monthly SRP fluxes and discharge, dissolved versus particulate fractions of nutrients, and N:P flux ratios were also evaluated. The methods described here provide tools to more clearly discern the effectiveness of nutrient-control strategies and can serve as ongoing measures of progress, or lack of progress, towards nutrient-reduction goals.", "Risk-based classification and interactive map of watersheds contributing anthropogenic stress to Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems ": "We describe development anthropogenic stress indices for coastal margins of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. Indices were derived based on the response of species assemblages to watershed-scale stress from agriculture and urbanization. Metrics were calculated for five groups of wetland biota: diatoms, wetland vegetation, aquatic invertebrates, fishes, and birds. Previously published community change points of these assemblages were used to classify each watershed as \u2018least-disturbed\u2019, \u2018at-risk\u2019, or \u2018degraded\u2019 based on community response to these stressors. The end products of this work are an on-line map utility and downloadable data that characterize the degree of agricultural land use and development in all watersheds of the US and Canadian Great Lakes basin. Discrepancies between the observed biological condition and putative anthropogenic stress can be used to determine if a site is more degraded than predicted based on watershed characteristics, or if remediation efforts are having beneficial impacts on site condition. This study provides a landscape-scale evaluation of wetland condition that is a critical first step for multi-scale assessments to help prioritize conservation or restoration efforts.", "Spatial-temporal variability of in situ cyanobacteria vertical structure in Western Lake Erie: Implications for remote sensing observations ": "Remote sensing has provided expanded temporal and spatial range to the study of harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) in western Lake Erie, allowing for a greater understanding of bloom dynamics than is possible through in situ sampling. However, satellites are limited in their ability to specifically target cyanobacteria and can only observe the water within the first optical depth. This limits the ability of remote sensing to make conclusions about full water column cyanoHAB biomass if cyanobacteria are vertically stratified. FluoroProbe data were collected at nine stations across western Lake Erie in 2015 and 2016 and analyzed to characterize spatio-temporal variability in cyanobacteria vertical structure. Cyanobacteria were generally homogenously distributed during the growing season except under certain conditions. As water depth increased and high surface layer concentrations were observed, cyanobacteria were found to be more vertically stratified and the assumption of homogeneity was less supported. Cyanobacteria vertical distribution was related to wind speed and wave height, with increased stratification at low wind speeds (<4.9\u202fm/s) and wave heights (<0.27\u202fm). Once wind speed and wave height exceeded these thresholds the assumption of vertically uniform cyanobacteria populations was justified. These findings suggest that remote sensing can provide adequate estimates of water column cyanoHAB biomass in most conditions; however, the incorporation of bathymetry and environmental conditions could lead to improved biomass estimates. Additionally, cyanobacteria contributions to total chlorophyll-a were shown to change throughout the season and across depth, suggesting the need for remote sensing algorithms to specifically identify cyanobacteria.", "Monitoring climate change and anthropogenic pressure at Lake Tanganyika ": "The African Great Lakes are under threat from global and local environmental challenges including climatic change, water pollution and overfishing. To address those issues, managers need observations based on regularly monitored environmental indicators. However, environmental monitoring of the African Great Lakes is often lacking or not based on harmonised methods. The present manuscript is a case study based on Lake Tanganyika, impacted by climate change and anthropogenic pressure affecting water quality, fisheries and biodiversity changes. The implementation of environmental monitoring has often not been continuous or standardised among bordering countries. This prevents managers from taking data-based decisions and opens a risky field where speculation may overcome a rational approach. Long-term monitoring observations are essential to guide management measures to adapt to climate changes and decrease, whenever possible, unfavourable human impact on the Great Lake environment. A regionally standardised long-term monitoring programme is proposed. The sustainability of such monitoring requires that it remains inexpensive and focuses on a few essential parameters. Its strength would be its uninterrupted implementation. Setting up a long-term integrated monitoring programme is also a goal of the Lake Tanganyika Authorities (LTA) with mandated national authorities and stakeholders. A Lake Tanganyika Regional Integrated Monitoring Programme (LTRIEMP) needs to be widely encouraged and supported to ensure its sustainability. General principles from the Lake Tanganyika case study could be useful to develop a wider harmonised sustainable long-term regional monitoring network of the African Great Lakes in a multi-lakes collaborative approach.", "Application of continuous turbidity sensors to supplement estimates of total phosphorus concentrations in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada ": "Accurate estimates of total phosphorus (TP) loadings to eastern Lake Erie are critical for developing load reduction targets and for determining if commitments are being met under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, 2012 (GLWQA). Currently, loading calculations from Canadian priority tributaries are supported by year-round event-focused water quality sampling using automated samplers and laboratory water quality measurements. Here we evaluate the suitability of continuously-measured parameters, namely turbidity and flow, to supplement or enhance knowledge about TP concentrations in the Grand River, ON, by providing continuous data alongside event-focused sample measurements. A series of simple and multiple linear regression models were evaluated and compared with respect to their ability to predict TP water concentrations as a function of different combinations of explanatory variables. Explanatory variables included turbidity, flow, season and flow condition (i.e. hysteresis). The models that performed best explained 63\u201365% of the variation of TP which is comparable to surrogate model applications in the U. S and elsewhere. Additional model calibration work is needed due to gaps in turbidity data particularly during high flow events. We emphasize the need for continued automated, event-focused water quality sampling. However, provided that operational challenges are overcome, our results indicate that sensor-derived water quality parameters to predict TP concentrations is a promising technique that may supplement and improve nutrient loading estimates in the Grand River into the future and provides guidance for the utilization of this method in other tributaries.", "Evaluating visible derivative spectroscopy by varimax-rotated, principal component analysis of aerial hyperspectral images from the western basin of Lake Erie ": "The Kent State University (KSU) spectral decomposition method provides information about the spectral signals present in multispectral and hyperspectral images. Pre-processing steps that enhance signal to noise ratio (SNR) by 7.37\u201319.04 times, enables extraction of the environmental signals captured by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center's, second generation, Hyperspectral imager (HSI2) into multiple, independent components. We have accomplished this by pre-processing of Level 1 HSI2 data to remove stripes from the scene, followed by a combination of spectral and spatial smoothing to further increase the SNR and remove non-Lambertian features, such as waves. On average, the residual stochastic noise removed from the HSI2 images by this method is 5.43\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.42%. The method also enables removal of a spectrally coherent residual atmospheric bias of 4.28\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.48%, ascribed to incomplete atmospheric correction. The total noise isolated from signal by the method is thus <\u00b17% based on analysis of multiple swaths. The method is essentially independent of the order of operations, extracting the same spectral components within error in all cases, spatial patterns that are very similar and explaining nearly identical amounts of information from each image. Based on comparison between multiple swaths the uncertainty in the variance associated with each component averages \u00b11.69% and is as low as \u00b10.08% and in all cases <\u00b13.15%.", "Phytoplankton blooms in Lake Erie impacted by both long-term and springtime phosphorus loading ": "Harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie have been increasing in severity over the past two decades, prompting new phosphorus loading target recommendations. We explore long-term drivers of phytoplankton blooms by leveraging new estimates of historical bloom extent from Landsat 5 covering 1984\u20132001 together with existing data covering 2002\u20132015. We find that a linear combination of springtime and long-term cumulative dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loading explains a high proportion of interannual variability in maximum summertime bloom extent for 1984\u20132015 (R\n                     2\n                     =0.75). This finding suggests that the impacts of internal loading are potentially greater than previously understood, and that the hypothesized recent increased susceptibility to blooms may be attributable to high decadal-scale cumulative loading. Based on this combined loading model, achieving mild bloom conditions in Lake Erie (defined in recent studies as bloom areas below 600km2 nine years out of ten) would require DRP loads to be reduced by 58% relative to the 2001\u20132015 average (equivalent to annual DRP loading of 240MT and April to July DRP loading of 78MT). Reaping the full benefits of load reductions may therefore take up to a decade due to the effects of historical loading.", "Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) spawning habitat in a northern lake: The role of wind and physical characteristics on habitat quality ": "Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) have a broad distribution across Canada's North, yet most studies that describe reproductive habitat are from the southern extent of their range. We assessed whether lake trout spawning habitat, typically characterized as wave-swept shoals with clean cobble that face predominant wind directions, is similar for a northern lake. Specifically, we examined a dozen sites around Alexie Lake, Northwest Territories, to test if physical habitat and wind exposure were important determinants of spawning site use and embryonic survival. Spawning occurred in ~2m water depth, on 3\u201315cm diameter clean substrate found on the leading edge of shoals that ended in a rock crib rising abruptly in nearshore regions around the lake. Wind direction was predominantly from the west, although it was highly variable within and among spawning seasons. We found evidence of lake trout spawning at each site examined, but not limited to shoals facing a predominate wind direction. High variation in embryonic survival (2\u201383%) from incubation trays was observed among spawning sites, suggesting a large gradient in habitat quality exists within a given lake. Modelled wind exposure did not predict embryonic survival, nor did physical characteristics that may influence interstitial water flow on spawning shoals. Our findings challenge the conventional role of wind as a predominant predictor of lake trout spawning site quality.

It is impossible to avoid risks of floods or prevent their occurrence, however it is plausible to work on the reduction of their effects and to reduce the losses which they may cause. Flash flood mapping to identify sites in high risk flood zones is one of the powerful tools for this purpose. Mapping flash flood will be beneficial to urban and infrastructure planners, risk managers and disaster response or emergency services during extreme and intense rainfall events. The objective of this paper is to generate flash flood map for Najran city, Saudi Arabia, using satellite images and GIS tools. To do so, we use SPOT and SRTM DEMs data for which accuracy assessment is achieved by using check points, obtained by GPS observations. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) is used to determine relative impact weight of flood causative factors to get a composite flood hazard index (FHI). The causative factors in this study are runoff, soil type, surface slope, surface roughness, drainage density, distance to main channel and land use.

Such kind of analysis allows identifying the main limiting factors for the agricultural production and enables decision makers to develop crop managements able to increase the land productivity. Objectives of this study were to develop a GIS based approach for land use suitability assessment which will assist land managers and land use planners to identify areas with physical constraints for a range of nominated land uses. Georeferenced soil survey data and field work observations have been integrated in a GIS based land use suitability assessment for agricultural planning in Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka, India. Also, GIS has been used to match the suitability for main crops based on the requirements of the crops and the quality and characteristics of land. Different land quality parameters, viz. soil texture, depth, erosion, slope, flooding and coarse fragments under various land units were evaluated for the crops. Subsequently all of them were integrated using a sequence of logical operations to generate land suitability and capability maps. Suitability and capability maps for each land use were developed to illustrate these suitability degrees and display the spatial representation of soils suitable for agriculture. It was also found that better land use options could be implemented in different land units as the conventional land evaluation methods suffer from limitation of spatial analysis for the suitability of various crops.", "Land use and land cover change detection using geospatial techniques in the Sikkim Himalaya, India ": "Mapping and monitoring of land use land cover (LULC) changes in the Himalayas is vital for sustainable development, planning and management.

Images from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Sentinel 2A (Multispectral Instrument) MSI data were used to extract land cover maps. Supervised classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) was applied to prepare LULC maps of the watershed. The accuracy of the classified map was assessed using a High Resolution Planet scope image and ground realities have been verified and ascertained through field observations and site specific interviews. As a result of policy changes and traditional agroforestry systems, LULC in the study watershed has undergone a series of complicated changes over the past three decades. Six major LULC classes viz; agriculture, barren land, built-up area, dense forest, open forests and water bodies have been identified and indicate that major land use in the watershed is forestry.

Seasonal and temporal LST is extracted in three phases e.g. in 1991, 2010 and 2014. Results show that LST increases 0.070\u00b0C/year and 0.114\u00b0C/year during winter and summer periods respectively and significant LST difference exist over different LULC units. Built up area retains maximum LST in all selected phases. Correlation coefficient among different deriving factors of LST with LST reveals that impervious land maximally control LST (r=0.62) followed by water bodies and vegetation cover. Even a single land use unit like impervious land water body and vegetation also create differences in LST (R2 of NDBI vs. LST ranges from 0.47 to 0.607; NDVI vs. LST ranges from 0.441 to 0.62). LST is almost co linear with aerial temperature as indicated by significant correlation value (0.44604 for January and 0.658 for April 2014) at 0.01 level of significance and the temperature gap between them ranges from 3.5\u00b0C to 6.5\u00b0C. Such co linearity validates the LST models. The estimated temperature gap is also strongly controlled by LULC. As the LULC pattern is getting changed, its imprint is reflected on LST and air temperature. So, immediate thinking about new urbanism should be adopted, started and implement to arrest the rising temperature and effect of urban heat island.", "Detecting, mapping and analysing of flood water propagation using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data and GIS: A case study from the Kendrapara District of Orissa State of India ": "Due to the penetration capacity of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data through clouds and hazy atmospheric circumstances like fog, smog, light rain, mist etc., it has ability to continuous observation of flood events for producing accurate, rapid and cost effective flood mapping. A study using time series RADARSAT SAR images in flood water detection, monitoring of spatial extent and propagation of flood inundation were described and analysed in this paper. The SAR images were first calibrated, geometrically corrected and filtered. Afterward, threshold method was applied to extract the inundated areas from the SAR images. In threshold method, density slicing technique was used to separate the open water and non-water (land) areas from the images. Later, to delineate the actual flooded area, permanent water bodies (e.g. river, lake, ponds etc.) were subtracted from the open water. Flood maps were super-imposed and analysed to find out the nature of spatial extent, duration of flood and to show how flooding spread through time. This study illustrates that the SAR data along with GIS can be used effectively for flood water mapping, monitoring and analysing the propagation of flood water in a flood prone area. Therefore, the findings of this study will help to take initiative to reduce the flood hazard impact and increase the flexibility in the process of flood management.", "Land use/land cover change assessment of Halda watershed using remote sensing and GIS ": "Being the only tidal river where major Indian carps spawn naturally, Halda is a unique heritage of Bangladesh and the surroundings of this river undergo chronological changes because of rapid urbanization, anthropogenic and socioeconomic activities.

The accuracy of generated terrain model depends on the interpolation mechanism adopted and hence it is needed to investigate the comparative performance of different approaches in this context. General interpolation techniques namely Inverse Distance Weighted, kriging, ANUDEM, Nearest Neighbor, and Spline approaches have been compared. Differential ground field survey has been conducted to generate reference DEM as well as specific set of test points for comparative evaluation. We have also investigated the suitability of Shuttle Radar Topographic Mapper Digital Elevation Mapper for Indian terrain by comparing it with the Survey of India (SOI) Digital Elevation Model (DEM).

Spatial observation of the translation of effluent rivers to influent rivers as the flow across the crystalline rock-sedimentary rock contact (CRSRC) led to the incorporation contact proximity thematic layer into the GIS-based model for this research. RS Digital Elevation Model data was used for generation of the thematic maps of slope, lineament and elevation while conventional maps were used to generate the thematic maps of soil, drainage density and drainage proximity. Geological field mapping and ground truthing gave rise to the thematic maps of geology and contact proximity. Weighting of thematic layers was consequently done by pair-wise comparison even as modeling was done by weighted overlay technique in a GIS environment. Groundwater potential modeling of the area revealed three zones: low potential zone coinciding with rugged and high relief areas; medium potential zone coinciding with areas on the crystalline basement with lower relief; and high potential zone which occur in the sedimentary terrain within the study area. In terms of areal extent the low, medium and high groundwater potential zones cover 249, 391 and 130 square kilometers respectively. Groundwater potential map agrees reasonably with field conditions. However, the need for drillers including government agencies to keep data such as pumping test is recommended as it will aid in validating models like this.", "Coastal landuse and land cover change and transformations of Kanyakumari coast, India using remote sensing and GIS ": "The coastal landuse and land cover features in the South West coast of Kanyakumari are dynamically regulated due to marine and terrestrial processes and often controlling by natural and anthropogenic activities. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the decadal changes and their transformations of landuse and land cover (LULC) features under Level II category of USGS-LULC Classification System using Landsat ETM+ and TM images using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm for the period 2000\u20132011. The classified LULC features are categorized as beachface land cover, cultivable lands, plantation and shrub vegetation, fallow land, barren land, settlements and built-ups, water bodies, and mining area, etc. The geo-database is prepared for LULC feature class with an attributes of name, location, area and spatial distribution, etc. It shows the larger area in beachface land cover (sandy beaches, foredunes, uplands, Teri dunes (laterite) and associated nearshore landforms), plantations, cultivable lands, fallows, and barren lands are converted into built-ups and it increases more than twice in the period of 10years. Using GIS techniques, the analysis of change detection matrix reveals that the total area of 45.90km2 in different LULC features periodically shifted or transformed from one state to another one or more states, i.e. the beachface land cover area of 1.24km2 is encroached for built-ups and 0.63km2 for placer mining during the decade. Meanwhile, the area of 0.21km2 in this cover is transformed into wetlands and saltwater bodies. During the past decade, the expansion of area in the built-ups and settlements are directly proportional to the growth of population, which produces severe threat to the coastal resources. Accuracy assessment of classified images shows the overall accuracy is estimated as 81.16% and 77.52% and overall Kappa coeffient statistical values of 0.83 and 0.76 for the year 2000 and 2011 respectively. Ground truth verification of the extracted LULC features performed using 120 samples (10 samples per class) reveals that the accuracy of classified features is 89%. This indicates the acceptable accuracy of the classified LULC features for landuse and land cover change studies. The geodatabase of LULC features is used as primary source for sustainable land resource management in the coastal region.", "Landslide susceptibility assessment using Frequency Ratio, a case study of northern Pakistan ": "The northern Pakistan is attributed with rough terrain, active seismicity, monsoon rains, and therefore hosts to variety of geohazards. Among the geohazards, landslides are the most frequent hazard with devastating impacts on economy and society. However, for most of the northern Pakistan, landslide susceptibility maps are not available which can be used for landslide hazard mitigation. This study aims to develop a remote sensing based landslide inventory, analysing their spatial distribution and develop the landslide susceptibility map. The area, selected for this study is comprised of Haramosh valley, Bagrote valley and some parts of Nagar valley, in the Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP) in Gilgit-Baltistan, northern Pakistan. The SPOT-5 satellite image was used to develop a landslide inventory which was subsequently verified in the field. The landslide causative factors of topographic attributes (slope and aspect), geology, landcover, distances from fault, road and streams were used to evaluate their influence on the spatial distribution of landslides. The study revealed that the distance to road, slope gradient has the significant influence on the spatial distribution of the landslides, followed by the geology. The derived results were used in the Frequency ratio technique to develop a landslide susceptibility map. The developed landslide susceptibility map can be utilized for landslide mitigation in the study area.", "Assessment of agricultural drought in Rajasthan (India) using remote sensing derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) ": "Owing to its severe effect on productivity of rain-fed crops and indirect effect on employment as well as per capita income, agricultural drought has become a prime concern worldwide. The occurrence of drought is mainly a climatic phenomenon which cannot be eliminated. However, its effects can be reduced if actual spatio-temporal information related to crop status is available to the decision makers. The present study attempts to assess the efficiency of remote sensing and GIS techniques for monitoring the spatio-temporal extent of agricultural drought. In the present study, NOAA-AVHRR NDVI data were used for monitoring agricultural drought through NDVI based Vegetation Condition Index. VCI was calculated for whole Rajasthan using the long term NDVI images which reveals the occurrence of drought related crop stress during the year 2002. The VCI values of normal (2003) and drought (2002) year were compared with meteorological based Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Rainfall Anomaly Index and Yield Anomaly Index and a good agreement was found among them. The correlation coefficient between VCI and yield of major rain-fed crops (r\n                     >0.75) also supports the efficiency of this remote sensing derived index for assessing agricultural drought.", "Assessment of land use land cover changes and its impact on variations of land surface temperature in Asansol-Durgapur Development Region ": "Fast transformation of land use/land cover because of urban expansion profoundly influences biodiversity and ecosystem function, as well as local and regional climate. One of the more serious impacts of urbanization is the formation of urban heat island (UHI) effect. Asansol-Durgapur Development Region is the second largest urban identity in West Bengal just after Kolkata urban agglomeration. Rapid urban growth in Asansol-Durgapur Development Region has brought about fast transformation of LULC pattern which in turn significantly affect the LST. Fast transformation of land use and land cover pattern brought significant changes in LST. The study attempts to examine the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) on land surface temperature in Asansol-Durgapur Development Region by employing multi temporal satellite data. LST is extracted in three different phases seasonally (e.g. winter, summer and post- monsoon periods) by using LANDSAT 4\u20135 TM and LANDSAT 8 OLI over the period of 1993, 2009 and 2015. Results depict that LST increases 0.06\u202f\u00b0C/year in winter and 0.43\u202f\u00b0C/year in summer periods respectively and the difference of surface radiant temperature is significant over existing different LULC units. The result of the study revealed that the impervious surface, industrial area and coal mining area has high surface temperature (38\u202f\u00b0C) and water bodies and vegetation cover has experienced low surface temperature (27\u202f\u00b0C). The study also examined causality of association between LST and deriving factors such as NDVI, NDBI and NDWI. The result reveals that LST maximally controls by impervious surface (r\u202f=\u202f0.95) than water bodies (r\u202f=\u202f0.62) and vegetation cover (r\u202f=\u202f0.61).", "Comparison the accuracies of different spectral indices for estimation of vegetation cover fraction in sparse vegetated areas ": "Quantitative estimation of canopy biophysical variables are very important in different studies such as meteorology, agriculture and ecology, so knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of these variables would be highly beneficial. Meanwhile, remote sensing is known as an important source of information to estimate fractional vegetation cover in large areas. Today spectral indices have been very popular in the remote sensing of vegetation features. But often reflections of soil and rocks are much more than reflections of sparse vegetation in these areas, that makes separation of plant signals difficult. So in this study measured fractional vegetation cover of a desert area were evaluated with 20 vegetation indices in five different categories as the most appropriate category, or indicator for desert vegetation to be identified. The five categories were including: (1) conventional ratio and differential indices such as NDVI; (2) indices corrected and derived from the traditional indicators such as NDVIc and GNDVI; (3) soil reflectance adjusted indices such as SAVI; (4) triangle indices based on three discreet bands in their equation (Green, Red and NIR) like TVI; and (5) non-conventional ratio and differential indices such as CI. According to the results of this research, DVI index with 0.668 the coefficient of determination (R\n                     2) showed the best fractional vegetation cover estimation. But according to the sparse vegetation in desert areas and the results of this research it seems none of these indicators alone can accurately estimate the percentage of vegetation cover, however, to do a proper estimation it is possible to enter data of these indices in a multivariate regression model. Using this method enabled us to increase the coefficient of determination of fractional vegetation cover estimation model up to 0.797.", "Assessment of land surface temperature variation due to change in elevation of area surrounding Jaipur, India ": "Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter for surface energy balance and urban climatology studies. LST is affected by the characteristics of the land surface such as vegetation cover and its type, land use-land cover and surface imperviousness. Incessant urbanization has resulted in many fold increase in the urban area and it has caused significant changes in the land surface. The difference in altitude of two points, that are located at different parts of a vast study area, may be large. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of change in elevation over LST. LST data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and digital elevation model from ASTER have been used. Consistent inverse linear trend is observed between LST and elevation for all the study seasons. High correlation (R2\n                     =0.73\u20130.87) is found between elevation and mean LST. It is seen that the change in LST due to elevation difference between two points separated in space in horizontal direction varies from 3.5\u00b0C to 4.6\u00b0C per 1000m which is relatively lesser than the condition when two points are separated in vertical direction (5.0\u00b0C\u201310.0\u00b0C per 1000m) i.e. along a vertical column of air. The study concludes that in any study related with spatial distribution of LST over a large area, effect of change in elevation at different locations shall also be considered and LSTs at different location shall be rationalized on the basis of their comparative elevations.", "Hydrological inferences from watershed analysis for water resource management using remote sensing and GIS techniques ": "The present study highlights the importance of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and satellite images for assessment of drainage and extraction of their relative parameters for the Orr watershed Ashok Nagar district, M.P., India. Hydrological parameters such as drainage analysis, topographic parameters and land use pattern were evaluated and interpreted for watershed management of the area.\n                  Hydrological module of ARC GIS software was utilized for calculation and delineation of the watershed and morphometric analysis of the watershed using SRTM DEM. The stream order of watershed ranges from first to sixth order showing dendritic type drainage network which is a sign of the homogeneity in texture and lack of structural control of the watershed. The drainage density in the area has been found to be low to medium which indicates that the area possesses highly permeable soils and low relief. The bifurcation ratio varies from 4.74 to 5 and the elongation ratio is 0.58 which reveals that the basin belongs to the elongated shaped basin category. The mean R\n                     b of the entire basin is 4.62 which indicates that the drainage pattern is not much influenced by geological structures. Land use map of the watershed was generated from latest available multispectral satellite data and whole watershed covers under agricultural land, settlement, fallow land, forest, mining areas and water body.\n                  The present study reveals that SRTM DEM based hydrological evaluation at watershed scale is more applied and precise compared to other available techniques.", "Monitoring land use change and measuring urban sprawl based on its spatial forms The case of Qom city": "As a response to the challenge of rapid pace of urbanization and lack of reliable data for environmental and urban planning, especially in the developing countries, this paper evaluates land use/cover change (LCLU) and urban spatial expansion, from 1987 to 2013, in the Qom, Iran, using satellite images, field observations, and socio-economic data. The supervised classification technique by maximum likelihood classifier has been employed to create a classified image and has been assessed based on Kappa index. The urban sprawl was also measured using Shannon\u2019s entropy based on its primary spatial forms. To our knowledge, measuring urban sprawl based on its spatial forms would contribute to prioritizing policies and specific regulations in dealing with its dominant form. Finally, LCLU change and urban growth were simulated for 2022, using CA-Markov model. The results revealed that dramatic growth of built-up areas has led to a significant decrease in the area of agriculture, gardens and wasteland, from 1987 to 2013. The obtained relative entropy values have indicated that the Qom city has experienced increasing urban sprawling over the last three decades. The continuous linear and non-continuous linear developments along the major roads and highways are the dominant forms of sprawl in Qom city. The CA-Markov model estimated that this unsustainable trend will continue in the future and built-up areas will be increased by 10% by 2022 resulting in potential loss of 438.03ha agriculture land, 638.37ha wasteland, and 17.01ha gardens. Those results indicated the necessity of appropriate policies and regulations particularly for limiting linear sprawl along the main roads.", "Application of near-infrared reflectance for quantitative assessment of soil properties ": "Beginning with a discussion of reflectance spectroscopy, this article attempts to provide a review on fundamental concepts of reflectance spectroscopic techniques. Their applications as well as exploring the role of Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy that would be used for monitoring and mapping soil characteristics. This technique began to be used in the second half of the 20th century for industrial purposes. Moreover, this article explores the potentiality of predicting soil properties based on spectroscopic measurements .Quantitative prediction of soil properties such as; salinity, organic carbon, soil moisture and heavy metals can be conducted using various calibration models \u2013 such models were developed depending on the measured soil laboratory analyses data and soil reflectance spectra thereby resampled to satellite images - to predict soil properties. The most common used models are stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), principal component regression (PCR) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Those methods are required to quickly and accurately measure soil characteristics at field to improve soil management and conservation at local and regional scales. Visable-Near Infra Red (VIS-NIR) has been recommended as a quick tool for mapping soil properties. Furthermore, VIS-NIR reflection spectroscopy reduces the cost and time, therefore has a wonderful ability and potential use as a rapid soil analysis for both precision soil management and assessing soil quality.", "A review on graph-based semi-supervised learning methods for hyperspectral image classification ": "In this article, a comprehensive review of the state-of-art graph-based learning methods for classification of the hyperspectral images (HSI) is provided, including a spectral information based graph semi-supervised classification and a spectral-spatial information based graph semi-supervised classification. In addition, related techniques are categorized into the following sub-types: (1) Manifold representation based Graph Semi-supervised Learning for HSI Classification (2) Sparse representation based Graph Semi-supervised Learning for HSI Classification. For each technique, methodologies, training and testing samples, various technical difficulties, as well as performances, are discussed. Additionally, future research challenges imposed by the graph-based model are indicated.", "Analysis of cooling effect of water bodies on land surface temperature in nearby region: A case study of Ahmedabad and Chandigarh cities in India ": "Erratic and unplanned development of the urban area has posed a threat to the environment in a country like India where the development is haphazard mostly. Congested and unsustainable planning, reduction in green covers and increased emissions from industries and vehicles have given birth to many climatic issues. One such issue is land surface temperature (LST) variations giving rise to Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. This study evaluates and provides direct evidence with the help of remote sensing technique about how stream water features affect the temperature variation in urban areas where the land use condition is very distinct. Surface water bodies present in an area are responsible for prospective cooling through evaporation thereby reducing the heating effect. Landsat images of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011of 30-meter resolution has been processed to produce the LST of the study areas. Water bodies, i.e., Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh and Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad are the research points to find the variation in microclimate developed near these water bodies. An appreciable average temperature dip of 7.51\u202f\u00b0C and 3.12\u202f\u00b0C is observed during summer and winter, respectively for three years near the Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh city. An average dip of about 1.57\u202f\u00b0C and 1.71\u202f\u00b0C is observed during summer and winter, respectively on the right bank of Sabarmati river up to an influence distance of about 200 to 300\u202fm. The average fall of temperature near the left bank is about 0.69\u202f\u00b0C and 0.65\u202f\u00b0C during summer and winter, respectively.", "Timelines and mechanisms of wildlife population recovery following the Exxon Valdez oil spill ": "Research and monitoring activities over the 28 years since the T/V Exxon Valdez ran aground and spilled oil into Prince William Sound, Alaska have led to an improved understanding of how wildlife populations were damaged, as well as the mechanisms and timelines of recovery. A key finding was that for some species, such as harlequin ducks and sea otters, chronic oil spill effects persisted for at least two decades and were a larger influence on population dynamics over the long term than acute effects of the spill. These data also offer insights into population variation resulting from factors other than the oil spill. For example, while many seabirds experienced direct and indirect effects of the spill, population trajectories of some piscivorous birds, including pigeon guillemots and marbled murrelets, were linked to long-term environmental changes independent of spill effects. Another species, killer whales, suffered population declines due to acute spill effects that have not been resolved despite lack of chronic direct effects, representing a novel pathway of long-term injury. The observed variation in mechanisms and timelines of recovery is linked to species specific life history and natural history traits, and thus may be useful for predicting population recovery for other species following other spills.", "Holocene monsoon and sea level-related changes of sedimentation in the northeastern Arabian Sea ": "The Indian Monsoon and the westerlies strongly influence the sedimentation in the northeastern Arabian Sea by impacting rainfall and erosion on land and on biogeochemical processes in the ocean. To disentangle the terrestrial and oceanic processes, we analysed mineralogical and bulk geochemical components of a Holocene sediment core offshore Pakistan. Endmember modelling of grain sizes and principal component analyses (PCA) of major and trace elements identify the origin of sediments and their dominant mode of transport. Sedimentation processes during the early Holocene (10.8\u20138.2 ka BP) were influenced by the post-glacial sea level rise and orbitally forced strengthening of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and westerlies. This led to a shift from rather terrestrial-dominated towards a marine-dominated sedimentation, whereas the fluvial source shifted from the Makran rivers to the Hab River near Karachi. During the mid-Holocene (8.2\u20134.2 ka BP) a combination of weakening ISM and southward displacement of the ITCZ enhanced the influence of the westerlies, together decreasing river discharges and enhancing aeolian input (probably from the Sistan Basin region). This trend continued during the last ca. 4 ka when the increasing aridification of the Hab River catchment further increased the aeolian inputs. Solar and lunar driven short-term variations as well as Bond events known from the North Atlantic Ocean superpose these trends. They lead to a pronounced increase of fluvial inputs between 8.6\u20138.4 ka BP and at ca. 3 ka BP as well as to dry events around 4.2 ka and 1.2\u20131 ka BP. Our study highlights the increasing influence of the westerlies on the sedimentation processes in the northeastern Arabian Sea towards the late Holocene.", "Climatological mean and decadal change in surface ocean pCO2, and net sea\u2013air CO2 flux over the global oceans ": "A climatological mean distribution for the surface water pCO2 over the global oceans in non-El Ni\u00f1o conditions has been constructed with spatial resolution of 4\u00b0 (latitude) \u00d75\u00b0 (longitude) for a reference year 2000 based upon about 3 million measurements of surface water pCO2 obtained from 1970 to 2007. The database used for this study is about 3 times larger than the 0.94 million used for our earlier paper [Takahashi et al., 2002. Global sea\u2013air CO2 flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO2, and seasonal biological and temperature effects. Deep-Sea Res. II, 49, 1601\u20131622]. A time-trend analysis using deseasonalized surface water pCO2 data in portions of the North Atlantic, North and South Pacific and Southern Oceans (which cover about 27% of the global ocean areas) indicates that the surface water pCO2 over these oceanic areas has increased on average at a mean rate of 1.5\u03bcatmy\u22121 with basin-specific rates varying between 1.2\u00b10.5 and 2.1\u00b10.4\u03bcatmy\u22121. A global ocean database for a single reference year 2000 is assembled using this mean rate for correcting observations made in different years to the reference year. The observations made during El Ni\u00f1o periods in the equatorial Pacific and those made in coastal zones are excluded from the database.\n                  Seasonal changes in the surface water pCO2 and the sea-air pCO2 difference over four climatic zones in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans are presented. Over the Southern Ocean seasonal ice zone, the seasonality is complex. Although it cannot be thoroughly documented due to the limited extent of observations, seasonal changes in pCO2 are approximated by using the data for under-ice waters during austral winter and those for the marginal ice and ice-free zones.\n                  The net air\u2013sea CO2 flux is estimated using the sea\u2013air pCO2 difference and the air\u2013sea gas transfer rate that is parameterized as a function of (wind speed)2 with a scaling factor of 0.26. This is estimated by inverting the bomb 14C data using Ocean General Circulation models and the 1979\u20132005 NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (R-2) wind speed data. The equatorial Pacific (14\u00b0N\u201314\u00b0S) is the major source for atmospheric CO2, emitting about +0.48Pg-Cy\u22121, and the temperate oceans between 14\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 in the both hemispheres are the major sink zones with an uptake flux of \u22120.70Pg-Cy\u22121 for the northern and \u22121.05Pg-Cy\u22121 for the southern zone. The high-latitude North Atlantic, including the Nordic Seas and portion of the Arctic Sea, is the most intense CO2 sink area on the basis of per unit area, with a mean of \u22122.5tons-Cmonth\u22121\n                     km\u22122. This is due to the combination of the low pCO2 in seawater and high gas exchange rates. In the ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean (50\u00b0\u201362\u00b0S), the mean annual flux is small (\u22120.06Pg-Cy\u22121) because of a cancellation of the summer uptake CO2 flux with the winter release of CO2 caused by deepwater upwelling. The annual mean for the contemporary net CO2 uptake flux over the global oceans is estimated to be \u22121.6\u00b10.9Pg-Cy\u22121, which includes an undersampling correction to the direct estimate of \u22121.4\u00b10.7Pg-Cy\u22121. Taking the pre-industrial steady-state ocean source of 0.4\u00b10.2Pg-Cy\u22121 into account, the total ocean uptake flux including the anthropogenic CO2 is estimated to be \u22122.0\u00b11.0Pg-Cy\u22121 in 2000.", "Patterns of distribution, abundance, and change over time in a subarctic marine bird community ": "Over recent decades, marine ecosystems of Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska, have experienced concurrent effects of natural and anthropogenic perturbations, including variability in the climate system of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. We documented spatial and temporal patterns of variability in the summer marine bird community in relation to habitat and climate variability using boat-based surveys of marine birds conducted during the period 1989\u20132012. We hypothesized that a major factor structuring marine bird communities in PWS would be proximity to the shoreline, which is theorized to relate to aspects of food web structure. We also hypothesized that shifts in physical ecosystem drivers differentially affected nearshore-benthic and pelagic components of PWS food webs. We evaluated support for our hypotheses using an approach centered on community-level patterns of spatial and temporal variability. We found that an environmental gradient related to water depth and distance from shore was the dominant factor spatially structuring the marine bird community. Responses of marine birds to this onshore-offshore environmental gradient were related to dietary specialization, and separated marine bird taxa by prey type. The primary form of temporal variability over the study period was monotonic increases or decreases in abundance for 11 of 18 evaluated genera of marine birds; 8 genera had declined, whereas 3 had increased. The greatest declines occurred in genera associated with habitats that were deeper and farther from shore. Furthermore, most of the genera that declined primarily fed on pelagic prey resources, such as forage fish and mesozooplankton, and few were directly affected by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Our observations of synchronous declines are indicative of a shift in pelagic components of PWS food webs. This pattern was correlated with climate variability at time-scales of several years to a decade.", "A review of intergovernmental collaboration in ecosystem-based governance of the large marine ecosystems of East Asia ": "East Asia encompasses six large marine ecosystems (LME): the South China Sea, the Gulf of Thailand, the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Sulu-Celebes Sea, and the Indonesian Sea. Despite occupying only 3 percent of the world\u2019s ocean surface, portions of this area are considered to be the global center of marine biodiversity. Since the early 1990s, Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA) has refined the Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) methodology and fostered a collaborative, partnership approach in the region to implement sustainable coastal and ocean development of these LMEs. ICM provided the foundational delivery system promoting interdisciplinary approaches and cooperation among users and beneficiaries to address complex development issues. While addressing marine pollution at the beginning, it became obvious that it had to be tackled in the context of the whole marine environment and sustainable development. PEMSEA developed and adopted the Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia (SDS-SEA) as the regional policy instrument from which countries of the region and other partners, individually or in groups, could apply the action programmes relevant to them. This in-depth review article describes the evolution of PEMSEA from a regional marine pollution project to an international organization, highlighting key developments, such as the SDS-SEA, the ICM Code, and the Ocean Investment Service, as well the advancement of ICM throughout the East Asian region and the adoption of the State of Oceans and Coasts reporting system to track progress. Looking forward, we summarize a United Nations Environment and IOC-UNESCO assessment of the current baseline status of these East Asian LMEs to examine future key areas for intervention by PEMSEA.", "Seasonal variation of zooplankton abundance and community structure in Prince William Sound, Alaska, 2009\u20132016 ": "Large calanoid copepods and other zooplankters comprise the prey field for ecologically and economically important predators such as juvenile pink salmon, herring, and seabirds in Prince William Sound (PWS).\u200b From 2009\u20132016, the Gulf Watch Alaska program collected zooplankton 5\u201310 times each year at 12 stations in PWS to establish annual patterns. Surveys collected 188 species of zooplankton with Oithona similis, Limacina helicina, Pseudocalanus spp., and Acartia longiremis as the most common species present in 519 samples. Generalized additive models assessed seasonal abundance and showed peak abundance in July (mean: 9826 no. m\u22123 [95% CI: 7990\u201312,084]) and lowest abundance in January (503 no. m\u22123 [373 to 678]). Significantly higher zooplankton abundance occurred in 2010 (542 no. m\u22123 \u00b1 55 SE) and lowest in 2013 (149 no. m\u22123 \u00b1 13). The species composition of communities, determined via hierarchical cluster analysis and indicator species analysis, produced six distinct communities based on season and location. The winter community, characterized by warm-water indicator species including Mesocalanus tenuicornis, Calanus pacificus, and Corycaeus anglicus, diverged into four communities throughout the spring and summer. The first spring community, characterized by copepods with affinities for lower salinities, occurred sound-wide. The second spring community, comprised of planktonic larvae, appeared sporadically in PWS bays in 2011\u20132013. Spring and summer open water stations were defined by the presence of large calanoid copepods. A summer community including the most abundant taxa was common in 2010 and 2011, absent in 2013, then sporadically appeared in 2014 and 2015 suggesting interannual variability of zooplankton assemblages. The zooplankton community shifted to a uniform assemblage characterized by cnidarians in the early autumn. Community assemblages showed significant correlations to a set of environmental variables including SST, mixed layer depth, location, depth of chlorophyll-a max, mixed layer average salinity, chlorophyll-a maximum, and bottom depth (\u03c1 = 0.24, p < 0.05). The disappearance of the summer community coincided with the appearance of the Gulf of Alaska warm water anomaly known as \u201cThe Blob\u201d. A shift in zooplankton community composition during critical grazing periods for predators such as juvenile Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) could have energetic consequences for overwintering success.", "Chemical composition of downward fluxes in the Cretan Sea (Eastern Mediterranean) and possible link to atmospheric deposition: A 7 year survey ": "To better assess the role of atmospheric deposition on seawater productivity in the Eastern Mediterranean 200 sinking particulate matter samples were collected at two different depths in the water column (500 and 1715\u202fm from the surface) during a seven-year period (1999\u20132005). The samples were analysed for various nutrients and elements of both natural and anthropogenic origin such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), organic matter, CaCO3, Si, Al, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ti, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. Moreover, sediment traps data were compared with atmospheric deposition to assess possible transfer mechanisms of material from the atmosphere to the water column.\n                  The amount of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) deposited via the atmosphere was higher up to a factor of 6 compared to the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) collected with the sediment traps, indicating significant external N deposition. On the other hand, atmospheric dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) deposition accounted for only 60% of the P measured at upper sediment traps indicating that the atmosphere plays a less significant role of the atmosphere for P compared to N. Atmospheric dust was found to be transferred almost quantitatively from the atmosphere to the deeper water layers, indicating significant impact of vertical mass transfer. The rapid vertical mass transfer during spring can be attributed to the formation of big aggregates around atmospheric dust particles, which settle quite fast. During summer and autumn mass transfer is hindered due to the stratification of the water column and low primary productivity.", "Global sea\u2013air CO2 flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO2, and seasonal biological and temperature effects ": "Based on about 940,000 measurements of surface-water pCO2 obtained since the International Geophysical Year of 1956\u201359, the climatological, monthly distribution of pCO2 in the global surface waters representing mean non-El Ni\u00f1o conditions has been obtained with a spatial resolution of 4\u00b0\u00d75\u00b0 for a reference year 1995. The monthly and annual net sea\u2013air CO2 flux has been computed using the NCEP/NCAR 41-year mean monthly wind speeds. An annual net uptake flux of CO2 by the global oceans has been estimated to be 2.2 (+22% or \u221219%)Pg Cyr\u22121 using the (wind speed)2 dependence of the CO2 gas transfer velocity of Wanninkhof (J. Geophys. Res. 97 (1992) 7373). The errors associated with the wind-speed variation have been estimated using one standard deviation (about\u00b12ms\u22121) from the mean monthly wind speed observed over each 4\u00b0\u00d75\u00b0 pixel area of the global oceans. The new global uptake flux obtained with the Wanninkhof (wind speed)2 dependence is compared with those obtained previously using a smaller number of measurements, about 250,000 and 550,000, respectively, and are found to be consistent within\u00b10.2Pg Cyr\u22121. This estimate for the global ocean uptake flux is consistent with the values of 2.0\u00b10.6Pg Cyr\u22121 estimated on the basis of the observed changes in the atmospheric CO2 and oxygen concentrations during the 1990s (Nature 381 (1996) 218; Science 287 (2000) 2467). However, if the (wind speed)3 dependence of Wanninkhof and McGillis (Res. Lett. 26 (1999) 1889) is used instead, the annual ocean uptake as well as the sensitivity to wind-speed variability is increased by about 70%.\n                  A zone between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres is found to be a major sink for atmospheric CO2. In these areas, poleward-flowing warm waters meet and mix with the cold subpolar waters rich in nutrients. The pCO2 in the surface water is decreased by the cooling effect on warm waters and by the biological drawdown of pCO2 in subpolar waters. High wind speeds over these low pCO2 waters increase the CO2 uptake rate by the ocean waters.\n                  The pCO2 in surface waters of the global oceans varies seasonally over a wide range of about 60% above and below the current atmospheric pCO2 level of about 360\u03bcatm. A global map showing the seasonal amplitude of surface-water pCO2 is presented. The effect of biological utilization of CO2 is differentiated from that of seasonal temperature changes using seasonal temperature data. The seasonal amplitude of surface-water pCO2 in high-latitude waters located poleward of about 40\u00b0 latitude and in the equatorial zone is dominated by the biology effect, whereas that in the temperate gyre regions is dominated by the temperature effect. These effects are about 6 months out of phase. Accordingly, along the boundaries between these two regimes, they tend to cancel each other, forming a zone of small pCO2 amplitude. In the oligotrophic waters of the northern and southern temperate gyres, the biology effect is about 35\u03bcatm on average. This is consistent with the biological export flux estimated by Laws et al. (Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 14 (2000) 1231). Small areas such as the northwestern Arabian Sea and the eastern equatorial Pacific, where seasonal upwelling occurs, exhibit intense seasonal changes in pCO2 due to the biological drawdown of CO2.", "Hypoxia and dissolved oxygen trends in the northeastern Adriatic Sea (Gulf of Trieste) ": "Physical and chemical data collected in three stations, with time series ranging from 1983, 1986 and 1989 to 2016, were analyzed in order to detect trends and frequency of occurrence of hypoxia events in bottom waters of the Gulf of Trieste (Adriatic Sea). The results of the analysis of 30-years data show a tendency toward increasing oxygen concentration in the bottom waters, nevertheless two hypoxic events were recorded during the summers of 2015 and 2016 even in a relatively shallow area of the Gulf. The spatial and temporal extent of these events was analyzed by coupling oceanographic surveys with automatic oceanographic measurements. During both summers, the area was characterized by high seawater temperature (up to 28.4\u202f\u00b0C at the surface) and salinity (38.1\u202fat the bottom) and a marked stratification of the water column, which prevented the mixing of oxygen-rich surface water with oxygen-poor deep water. The main contribution to oxygen depletion in the bottom waters was attributed to plankton respiration (54\u201361%) and to benthic oxygen consumption (39\u201346%), which exceeded the oxygen produced by planktonic and benthic microalgae and the one diffused from the overlying oxygenated water. These events of marked oxygen depletion in shallow coastal ecosystems are possibly favored by the positive temperature trend in bottom waters, coupled with the increase in riverine discharges in late spring, limiting vertical mixing and bottom water renewal.", "Controls of primary production in two phytoplankton blooms in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ": "The Antarctic Circumpolar Current has a high potential for primary production and carbon sequestration through the biological pump. In the current study, two large-scale blooms observed in 2012 during a cruise with R.V. Polarstern were investigated with respect to phytoplankton standing stocks, primary productivity and nutrient budgets. While net primary productivity was similar in both blooms, chlorophyll a \u2013specific photosynthesis was more efficient in the bloom closer to the island of South Georgia (39\u00b0W, 50\u00b0S) compared to the open ocean bloom further east (12\u00b0W, 51\u00b0S). We did not find evidence for light being the driver of bloom dynamics as chlorophyll standing stocks up to 165mgm\u22122 developed despite mixed layers as deep as 90m. Since the two bloom regions differ in their distance to shelf areas, potential sources of iron vary. Nutrient (nitrate, phosphate, silicate) deficits were similar in both areas despite different bloom ages, but their ratios indicated more pronounced iron limitation at 12\u00b0W compared to 39\u00b0W. While primarily the supply of iron and not the availability of light seemed to control onset and duration of the blooms, higher grazing pressure could have exerted a stronger control toward the declining phase of the blooms.", "Vertical distribution and diel migration of mesopelagic fishes on the northern slope of the South China sea ": "Mesopelagic fishes are major components contributing to deep-sea scattering layers in the open ocean. They have the potential to support a substantial higher trophic level harvest, but knowledge about this possible resource is still rudimentary. Some of the mesopelagic fishes undertake diel vertical migration (DVM) over large depths by feeding in shallow water during darkness and migrating to depth to avoid visual predators during daylight. The vertical distribution and diel migration pattern of the mesopelagic fishes on the northern slope of the South China Sea were investigated during two multidisciplinary surveys carried out in October 2014 and June 2015. Based on acoustic and biological sampling, a distinct deep scattering layer (DSL) consisting mainly of mesopelagic fishes was identified in deep water (>300\u202fm). Extensive diel vertical migration for hundreds of meters to form dense aggregations in the epipelagic zone (0\u2013150\u202fm) at night was observed in both seasons, but the migration was highly species dependent. While most of the Myctophiformes and the Perciformes undertook DVM, most of the Salmoniformes and Beryciformes remained in deep water both day and night. Based on paired day-night differences of acoustic density in the DSL, the migrating proportion of mesopelagic backscatter varied markedly in different locations, ranging from 28% to 63%, with a mean of 48% in two seasons. The extensive vertical migration occurred in separate groups at different periods during sunset and sunrise hours. Additional analysis showed that the center of gravity of the mesopelagic backscatters (200\u20131000\u202fm) and their night distribution in the subsurface layer (10\u2013150\u202fm) were positively correlated with the mean temperature in respective zones. Moreover, some of the mesopelagic communities on the slope were found to undertake pronounced diel horizontal migration in a pattern of towards the shore in the evening and away from the shore after midnight. The horizontal migrant species were mainly Myctophidae, in particular Diaphus chrysorhynchus and Diaphus garmani. Simultaneous analysis on typical tidal currents indicated that the horizontal migration, over a large distance with high speed and biomass, could not be explained by passive transport due to tidal currents alone, and the active swimming of the mesopelagic fishes may also play an important role.", "Biological production in the Indian Ocean upwelling zones - Part 2: Data based estimates of variable compensation depth for ocean carbon models via cyclo-stationary Bayesian Inversion. ": "This study attempts to resolve the complex interior ocean biophysical interactions in an ocean biogeochemistry model via a cyclo-stationary Bayesian approach using surface ocean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and upper ocean inventories of phosphate as observational constraints with a special focus on the Indian Ocean. A seasonal cycle in community compensation depth (Zc), a key parameter involved in the estimation of biological production in ecosystem models is been retrieved without any prior information. Zc typically is assumed to be a constant in ecosystem models but in reality it undergoes a seasonal cycle as evidenced by observations and model simulations. To retrieve the seasonality in compensation depth via inversion, the Indian Ocean is divided into 8 key regions and Zc is optimized for each climatological month in each region. The data-based inversions with surface ocean pCO2 and upper ocean phosphate as observational constraints retrieve a seasonal cycle in Zc consistent with what is identified by the biological parameterization in our earlier study (Sreeush et al., 2018). When implemented in the model, the data-based estimation of Zc significantly reduce the RMSE of CO2 flux and pCO2 over major parts of the Indian Ocean as compared to that of a process-based estimation of Zc from Sreeush et al. (2018). The results here demonstrate that surface ocean pCO2 data, as compared to upper ocean phosphate, offers a stronger observational constraint on the estimation of biology in upwelling regions. Surface ocean pCO2 is an integrated response to the solubility and biological pumps and it is apparent that the constraint imposed by pCO2 is able to cascade through the system to improve estimates of the community compensation depth and translate to reduced biases in various other biogeochemical variables.", "Temporal changes in mesoscale aggregations and spatial distribution scenarios of the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) ": "The Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) is the most important small pelagic of the Humboldt Current System (HCS), supporting the largest mono-specific fishery in the world. The spatial behavior of this species tends to be very dynamic at different spatial scales, influenced mostly by its biomass level and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to analyze temporal and spatial fluctuations in anchovy spatial distribution off Peru, based and modeled on acoustic data, focusing on large- and meso-scale spatial structures. We employed data from 41 scientific surveys (1994\u20132016) and Bayesian hierarchical spatial models to obtain the anchovy's spatial distribution, allowing us to identify spatial structures at specific scales. Our results showed similar temporal trends in the number of mesoscale structures, their areas and anchovy density, exhibiting altogether two breakpoints in the time series: ~1999 and ~2013. The last period (2013\u20132016) was similar to the earlier one (1994\u20131999), in terms of low values of mesoscale structure indicators. On the other hand, we identified four spatial scenarios differentiated by the aggregative behavior, which were highly influenced by seasons and El Ni\u00f1o events. Each scenario had recurrent, or fidelity, areas placed in different locations. For instance, for the \u2018El Ni\u00f1o scenario\u2019 a particularly coastal recurrent area was identified, which might be a refuge zone for this species during these unfavorable events. Finally, we assessed differences in biomass estimates of each scenario. The highest biomass values were estimated for the \u2018Summer favorable scenario\u2019 and the lowest ones for the \u2018El Ni\u00f1o scenario\u2019, which supports the MacCall's basin hypothesis for this species. This study expands the current knowledge of the Peruvian anchovy and it is a first step to understand the effects on this species of the last El Ni\u00f1o events (2014\u20132016) that occurred in the northern Humboldt Current System.", "What happened in the mid-1990s? The coupled ocean-atmosphere processes behind climate-induced ecosystem changes in the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean ": "Northeast Atlantic marine ecosystems such as the Bay of Biscay, Celtic Sea, English Channel, Subpolar Gyre region, Icelandic waters and North Sea as well as the Mediterranean Sea show concomitant \u2018regime shift\u2019-like changes around the mid-1990s, which involved all biota of the pelagial: phytoplankton, zooplankton, pelagic fish assemblages, demersal fish assemblages and top predators. These shifts were caused by complex ocean-atmosphere interactions initiating large-scale changes in the strength and direction of the current systems, that move water masses around the North Atlantic, and involved the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and the subpolar gyre (SPG). The contractions and expansions of the SPG and fluctuations of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) play a key role in these complex processes. Small pelagic fish population trends were the sentinels of these changes in the mid-1990s in the ecosystems under investigation.", "Conditions of persistent oil on beaches in Prince William Sound 26 years after the Exxon Valdez spill ": "On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez grounded on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilling an estimated 10.8 million gallons of crude oil. Contrary to early projections, subsequent studies over several decades have shown subsurface oil persisting on impacted beaches. Here we present findings from a lingering oil survey conducted during the summer of 2015 at a small set of beaches in Prince William Sound known to have persistent subsurface Exxon Valdez oil. The objectives of the survey were to estimate how much oil remains at these sites, the oil composition, and oil retention rates compared to previous studies. Results from the survey found lingering oil was present at 8 of 9 sites that were revisited. Surveys revealed little evidence of change in oil area or mass over the last 14 years, nor has there been a change in the distribution of oiling intensities or their location on the beach. Detailed analysis of the oil indicated it has not weathered since 2001. Subsurface oils collected in 2015 have enriched concentrations of phenanthrenes and chrysenes relative to oil originating in the cargo hold indicating that buried oil has retained some toxic potential over the last two decades, but it is not currently bioavailable. Subsurface oil appears to be sequestered in sediments and protected from hydrological washing and low oxygen and nutrient levels inhibiting biodegradation. These findings are consistent with previous surveys and predictive geomorphic models suggesting the estimated 0.6% Exxon Valdez oil remaining is sequestered and not bioavailable unless disturbed and will likely persist in the environment on a decadal scale.", "Alternative energy pathways in Southern Ocean food webs: Insights from a balanced model of Prydz Bay, Antarctica ": "In recent years, there has been a shift away from the long-standing paradigm in which a short, krill-dominated food chain was considered to be the central element in Southern Ocean food webs. Instead, there is now increasing recognition that alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups (mesopelagic fish and squid) may be equally (if not more) important than the krill pathway in many regions. Ecosystem models are a valuable tool to synthesise existing data on the structure of marine food webs and to visualise and quantify alternative energy pathways. In this study we develop a static mass balance food web model for the southern Kerguelen Axis region (Prydz Bay and Princess Elizabeth Trough) to evaluate the importance of alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups, including fish, squid and krill, in maintaining energy flow to top predators within East Antarctica. Our model reveals several major trophic pathways distinct from, and equally important to the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) pathway. Using simple scenarios of reductions in krill biomass, we investigate how the system might switch to a state dominated by fish and squid pathways with the response of krill-reliant predators strongly dependent on their ability to switch to other prey sources. We conclude by discussing what these findings might suggest for the future vulnerability of East Antarctic food webs and the implications for future modelling work in the region.", "Partitioning the Indian Ocean based on surface fields of physical and biological properties ": "Comprehensively sampling the ocean in situ remains a challenge, even in the current era of rapid technological development. In less than a decade, the deployment of thousands of autonomous profiling floats increased the number of ocean temperature profiles by an order of magnitude compared to ship-based sampling in the past. But expendable floats cannot sample all the physical and biogeochemical regimes in the global ocean. A promising avenue that could guide in situ sampling is to partition oceans based on selected properties in order to identify \u201chomogeneous\u201d areas. This approach greatly reduces the number of measurements needed to represent the state of the ocean. However, homogeneous areas can be partitioned in many ways: depending on whether a single or several properties are considered; and on whether the definition of boundaries is left to expert knowledge or derived from objective analysis techniques. Here, we use a clustering method to map and partition many surface variables, and we further examine how this partitioning is affected by various ways of averaging or normalizing the input data. We performed this study using 15 different surface fields of physical and biological properties derived from satellite remote sensing observations and from global model outputs at a monthly resolution. The area of study is the Indian Ocean - one of the least-sampled oceans - which is the focus of a global research effort under the auspices of the second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2). We show a strong effect of the average absolute values of the data, which can be removed to better examine the phenology of the properties. However, normalization is not mandatory; the technique selected should depend on the scientific questions at hand. Our clusters did generally did not match closely the regions identified by Longhurst in his seminal work on ocean provinces.", "Potential changes in the distribution of suitable habitat for Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) under climate change scenarios ": "The Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax, is the most important fishery by volume in Mexico; however, this small pelagic species shows fluctuations in catch due to its susceptibility to environmental changes. In turn, this susceptibility leads to variations in distribution, abundance, and recruitment, making the Pacific sardine highly vulnerable to the effects of global climate change. In this study, we analyze the effects of environmental variability on the Pacific sardine distribution through the development of the habitat suitability for the Mexican Pacific. We used bathymetry, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS) and net primary productivity (NPP) to develop an ecological niche model to forecast the suitable habitat of the Pacific sardine and reproduce the historical patterns for the 2003\u20132017 period. We then used this model to make future projections to the year 2100 using the emission scenarios RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Under the RCP models, on average, the greatest impact of climate change was observed inside the Gulf of California, with an increase in SST (+1.68\u00a0\u00b0C) and a decrease in 25% of NPP (\u2212256\u00a0mg\u00a0C m\u22122 d\u22121) reducing habitat availability for this species by 95. Stocks on the Pacific coast are projected to fluctuate substantially, similar to past events driven by environmental variability. At the regional level, a loss of suitable habitat of up to 50% is expected by the end of this century for the Pacific sardine.", "Interannual to decadal variability in the catches of small pelagic fishes from China Seas and its responses to climatic regime shifts ": "Small pelagic fishes such as sardine and anchovy play an important role in marine ecosystem and are affected largely by environmental changes because of their character as r-strategists and their low trophic levels. Small pelagic fishes are crucial targets of Chinese fisheries, accounting for 26% of the total catch in 2014. Their catches show an increasing trend since the 1950s. However, there is still little information on small pelagic species inhabiting Chinese waters. Catch trends and impacts of climatic regime shifts for six typical commercially important small pelagic species, chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), Japanese scad (Decapterus maruadsi), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus), Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) and horse mackerel (Trachurus japonicus), are analyzed using Chinese Fishery Statistics, FAO data, climatic indices and sea surface temperature (SST) data. The aim is to explore the interannual to decadal variability of their catches in China Seas and their responses to climatic regime shifts. Decadal variability is evident in the catches of the six small pelagic fishes with different variation patterns between warm- and cold-water species. Step changes in catches of the six species were observed in 1976/77, 1986/87, 1995/96, 2001/02 and 2005/06, while regime shifts in climatic/SST indices occurred around 1976/77, the late 1980s and the mid-1990s. This indicates that decadal variations in small pelagic fishes respond strongly to the climatic regime shifts, and the different response patterns of warm- and cold-water species reflect their different life strategies. Marine thermal variation patterns during the period 1981\u20132000 were well explained by different phase changes in the SSTs between summer and winter and were consistent with the step change in the catches of small pelagic fishes. The double-integration hypothesis, which indicates that cumulative integrations of atmospheric forcing can generate marine population responses, is useful both to understand the process from climate forcing to fish and the controlling mechanism of climate variability on small pelagic fishes in China Seas.", "Plastic pollution of the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka Trench area (NW pacific) ": "During the German\u2013Russian expedition KuramBio (Kuril\u2013Kamchatka Biodiversity Studies) to the northwest Pacific Kuril\u2013Kamchatka Trench and its adjacent abyssal plain, we found several kinds and sizes of plastic debris ranging from fishing nets and packaging to microplastic in the sediment of the deep-sea floor. Microplastics were ubiquitous in the smaller fractions of the box corer samples from every station from depths between 4869 and 5766m. They were found on the abyssal plain and in the sediments of the trench slope on both sides. The amount of microplastics differed between the stations, with lowest concentration of 60piecesperm2 and highest concentrations of more than 2000piecesperm2. Around 75% of the microplastics (defined here as particles <1mm) we isolated from the sediment samples were fibers. Other particles were paint chips or small cracked pieces of unknown origin. The Kuril\u2013Kamchatka Trench area is known for its very rich marine fauna (Zenkevich, 1963). Yet we can only guess how these microplastics accumulated in the deep sea of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench area and what consequences the microplastic itself and its adsorbed chemicals will have on this very special and rich deep-sea fauna. But we herewith present an evaluation of the different kinds of plastic debris we found, as a documentation of human impact into the deep sea of this region of the Northwest Pacific.", "Oxygen modulates bacterial community composition in the coastal upwelling waters off central Chile ": "Bacterial community composition and its relationship to oxygen were investigated in the non-sulfidic shelf waters exposed to seasonal upwelling and oxygen deficiency off central Chile. Using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and iTAG sequencing analyses of nearly 4 years of monthly sampling through the water column (5\u201380\u202fm depth), we found a clear partitioning of community composition that could be attributed to dissolved oxygen (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.578) in comparison to other environmental variables, such as light, fluorescence, temperature, salinity, microbial abundance or nutrients. Bacteroidetes (orders Sphingobacteriales and Flavobacteriales), SAR11 (subclades Ia - Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique and II), an unclassified group of Alphaproteobacteria, and SAR86 dominated in waters containing dissolved oxygen concentrations \u226570\u202f\u03bcM. In contrast, taxonomic groups associated with capabilities of either oxidative or reductive cycling of inorganic sulfur dominated in waters with dissolved oxygen from ~70\u202f\u03bcM to undetectable levels. The dominant groups were Arctic96BD-19, SUP05 and SAR324 (sulfur oxidation) and Desulfobacterales (sulfate reduction). Desulfobacterales are known to come primarily from sulfidic, nitrate/nitrite-depleted waters and sediments. Their presence, therefore, provides taxonomic evidence for pelagic dissimilatory sulfate reduction within oxygen-depleted coastal environments.", "The carbonate system of the Eastern-most Mediterranean Sea, Levantine Sub-basin: Variations and drivers ": "The carbonate system is a vital buffering system that controls the pH of seawater and maintains a healthy environment for marine organisms. As concerns regarding the fate of anthropogenic CO2 in the oceans are rising, it is becoming increasingly urgent to systematically quantify and understand this system's parameters, particularly in heavily human-impacted areas, such as the Mediterranean Sea. To date, the paucity of time-series stations adopted to monitor the carbonate system in this sea has precluded characterizing the region at an adequate spatial resolution. Here, we present and study the seasonal and annual variability and drivers of the first carbonate system dataset collected for the Lebanese waters, monthly at the upper 80\u202fm between 2012 and 2017 in two time-series stations offshore the North of Lebanon-Levantine Sub-basin, Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Annual trends were calculated for the non-adjusted and the adjusted carbonate system parameters (an adjustment that reduces the influence of simple-dilution-concentration [SDC] processes on the trends). Our results show high carbonate system inventory [total alkalinity (AT), total dissolved inorganic carbon (CT), and pH] compared to other Mediterranean areas. The obtained trends reflect increasing rates for both AT and CT, only significant at surface for CT (+5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0kg\u22121.yr\u22121; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Whereas annual acidification rates were always significant (i.e. from \u22120.009\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.004 to \u22120.0021\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.001 pH units.yr\u22121 at 0\u202fm and in the upper 80\u202fm respectively for pHT25adj).

Moreover, our results showed that SDC processes, together with CO2 release/invasion and the active overturning circulation, are controlling this system in the Lebanese seawater, Eastern-most Mediterranean Sea. Contrariwise, the increasing trend of total alkalinity, mainly attributed to SDC processes (i.e. riverine inputs, weathering during extreme events, precipitations), may be buffering the observed acidification rate, which could have been worst in case AT in our area was lower.\n               \n               \n                  Highlights\n                  \n                     \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           The first carbonate system dataset collected for the Lebanese waters, -Levantine Sub-basin, Eastern Mediterranean Sea, are presented in this study.\n                        \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           Our results show high carbonate system inventory compared to other Mediterranean areas with increasing rates of both AT and CT.\n                        \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           Annual acidification rates have been document (i.e. from \u22120.009\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.004 to \u22120.0021\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.001 pH units.yr\u22121 at 0\u202fm and in the upper 80\u202fm respectively for pHT25adj.\n                        \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           Decreasing trends of the saturation states for both CaCO3 minerals were calculated.\n                        \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           Simple-dilution-concentration processes, together with CO2 release/invasion and the active overturning circulation, are controlling this system in our study area.\n                        \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           The increasing trend of total alkalinity may be buffering the observed acidification rate, which could have been worst in case AT in our area was lower.", "Changes in source waters to the Southern California Bight ": "Historical hydrographic data (1984\u20132012) from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program and global reanalysis products were used to quantify recent water mass variability off the coast of Southern California. Dissolved oxygen concentrations continued to decline within the lower pycnocline, concurrent with strong increases in nitrate and phosphate that have spatial patterns matching those of dissolved oxygen. Silicic acid also shows an increasing trend in the offshore portion of the region, but has strong and opposing trends in the upper (increasing) and lower-pycnocline (decreasing) within the Southern California Bight. The varying rates of change in the inorganic nutrients yield a more complex pattern of variability in the nutrient ratios, resulting in large decreases in the N:P and Si:N ratios within the Southern California Bight at depths that provide source waters for upwelling. Basin-scale reanalysis products are consistent with low-frequency water mass changes observed off Southern California and suggest that advection of modified source waters is the cause of the variability. The biogeochemical changes described here may have important impacts on the regional ecosystem, including a reduction of viable pelagic habitat and community reorganization.", "Coupled effects of ocean current on wind stress in the Bay of Bengal: Eddy energetics and upper ocean stratification ": "This study examines the effect of surface current in the bulk formula for the wind stress, referred to as the relative wind (RW) effect, on the energetics of the geostrophic circulation and the upper ocean stratification in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the summer monsoon seasons. When the RW effect is taken into account in the high-resolution SCOAR (WRF-ROMS) regional coupled model simulation and compared to the run without such a consideration, the kinetic energy both in the mean (MKE) and eddy (EKE) is reduced by more than a factor of two. The most significant reduction in the kinetic energy is found along the path of the northward East India Coastal Current (EICC) and to the south of its separated latitude. The energetics calculations and spectral analysis reveal that this significant damping of EKE is primarily due to reduced eddy wind work principally at wavelengths close to the first baroclinic Rossby deformation radius, indicating the modulation of the wind work by geostrophic mesoscale eddy fields. Moreover, the mixed layer depth (MLD) is significantly shoaled south of the separated EICC latitude, the area dominated by anticyclonic eddy activity. The shallower mixed layer and enhanced stratification with the RW effect are attributed to doming of the isopycnals by the anomalous upward Ekman velocity, which itself is generated by the interaction of anticyclonic mesoscale surface current and the prevailing southwesterly monsoonal wind. Overall, the geostrophic circulation and upper ocean stratification along the EICC and south of its separated latitude exhibit the most significant dynamical response. This result implies that this southwestern part of the BoB is a hot spot for the momentum exchange between the surface circulation and the monsoonal winds, thus a potential area for focused field measurements for the ocean circulation energetics and air-sea interaction.", "Operational assimilation of glider temperature and salinity for an improved description of the Cyprus eddy ": "The authors demonstrate how assimilation of hydrographic data from a single ocean glider can significantly improve short-term regional forecasts. An operational data assimilation system for the Eastern Mediterranean is described and evaluated for a six-month numerical experiment consisting of two nearly-identical hydrodynamic model runs. In the assimilative run, glider profiles of temperature and salinity were assimilated daily into a high-resolution ocean forecast, after an initial spin up of one week. In the control run, the same initial and boundary conditions were used to produce an operational forecast, but without assimilation of in situ data. While both runs were similar for most of the time and most of the domain, significant differences were found mostly near the region of assimilation, particularly when the glider passed through the anticyclonic Cyprus eddy, but also far away. The spatial scale at which the assimilation of the glider data improved the forecast is up to 40\u201350\u202fkm around the glider. Root mean square differences of the misfits between the temperature and salinity observations and the model background field at those locations were approximately 15% lower in the assimilative run. Improvements in the forecasting capability of surface currents were found and would provide a significant improvement of predictive capacity for applications such as pollutant spreading or offshore operational safety.", "Effect of ball and feed particle size distribution on the milling efficiency of a ball mill: An attainable region approach ": "In this article, alternative forms of optimizing the milling efficiency of a laboratory scale ball mill by varying the grinding media size distribution and the feed material particle size distribution were investigated. Silica ore was used as the test material. The experimental parameters that were kept constant in this investigation was the grinding media filling, powder filling and the mill rotational speed. The data obtained from these batch tests was then analyzed using a model free technique called the Attainable Region method. This analysis technique showed that the required product fineness is a function of grinding media and feed material size distributions. It was also observed from the experimental results that in order to increase the milling efficiency of a ball mill, towards optimum production of material in the desired size class, there is a need to correlate the ball size and the feed size distributions.", "Bioremediation of acid mine drainage using algae strains: A review ": "Acid mine drainage (AMD) causes massive environmental concerns worldwide. It is highly acidic and contains high levels of heavy metals causing environmental damage. Conventional treatment methods may not be effective for AMD. The need for environmental remediation requires cost effective technologies for efficient removal of heavy metals. In this study, algae based systems were reviewed and analyzed to point out the potentials and gaps for future studies. Algae strains such as Spirulina sp., Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Cladophora, Oscillatoria, Anabaena, Phaeodactylum tricornutum have showed the capacity to remove a considerable volume of heavy metals from AMD. They act as \u201chyper-accumulators\u201d and \u201chyper-adsorbents\u201d with a high selectivity for different elements. In addition, they generate high alkalinity which is essential for precipitation of heavy metals during treatment. However, algae based methods of abating AMD are not the ultimate solution to the problem and there is room for more studies.", "The effect of alkali treatment on mechanical, morphological and thermal properties of date palm fibers (DPFs): Study of the interface of DPF\u2013Polyurethane composite ": "This paper focuses on investigating the effect of alkali treatments on the bond characteristics of date palm fibers (DPFs) in a polyurethane (PU) matrix, including the bond strength, pullout energy. This kind of fiber treatment is generally used to improve the mechanical behavior of composites. Raw DPFs underwent a surface modification method by alkali treatment with different percentages of NaOH: 0\u00a0wt%, 2\u00a0wt%, 5\u00a0wt% and 10\u00a0wt%. All treatments were carried out under mild conditions without heating for 1\u00a0h. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), tensile properties, surface morphology and thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) of treated DPFs were investigated. The experimental results showed that the alkali treatment can effectively remove non cellulosic materials and enhance the tensile strength of DPFs. In order to investigate on DPF-PU adhesion, the fiber pullout test was also carried out. It was found that the DPF-PU interfacial properties increased after the alkali treatment, especially fiber pullout energy. Indeed the optimal alkali concentration was reported at 5\u00a0wt% in terms of the bond characteristics, and, this is mainly due to the reduction of the amorphous parts of the fibers.", "The effect of NaOH catalyst concentration and extraction time on the yield and properties of Citrullus vulgaris seed oil as a potential biodiesel feed stock ": "In this work, oil was extracted from Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) seeds for potential feedstock in biodiesel production. The results showed that, the oil content from Citrullus vulgaris seeds oil during extraction reached an average yield of 50%. Biodiesel was produced via transesterification using NaOH as catalyst. The effect of NaOH on the yield of the biodiesel was investigated at three different concentrations; 0.13, 0.15 and 0.18\u202fg and oil to methanol ratio of 5:1 under different reaction times; 90, 120 and 150\u202fmin\u202fat 60\u202f\u00b0C. The yield of biodiesel from NaOH concentration of 0.13\u202fg was found to be 70% as compared to those of concentrations, 0.15\u202fg and 0.18\u202fg which were 53% and 49% respectively.\n                  Gas chromatography was used to identify the methyl ester groups present in the biodiesel and the results revealed both concentration and time-dependent increase in oil yield. The physicochemical properties of the watermelon seed oil such as flash point (141.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4\u2013143.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2), density (0.86\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u20130.91\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.01\u202fg/cm3), kinematic viscosity (30.50\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u201331.20\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202fmm2/s) and acid value (mg KOH/g) are similar to conventional vegetable oils. This work therefore, highlights the potential utility of water melon seeds for biodiesel production.", "Biosorption studies of lead and copper using rogers mushroom biomass \u2018Lepiota hystrix\u2019 ": "This study points out potential of rogers mushroom (Lepiota hystrix) biomass in biosorption of copper and lead from aqueous solutions. The efficiency of biosorption was tested in batch experiments and the metal ion concentration analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The analysis of FTIR spectrum reveals that the metal ions uptake by roger mushroom involves interaction of metal ion and hydroxyl, carboxyl and carbonyl groups of the biomass at optimum pH of 4.5\u20136.0 and sorbent mass of 1.5\u20132.1\u00a0g for Cu and Pb, respectively. Adsorption capacities were found to be 3.9 and 8.9\u00a0mg/g at a contact time of 25\u201340\u00a0min and initial metal ion concentration of 300\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcg/g for Pb and Cu, respectively. The biosorption process follows second order kinetics and fitted the Langmuir isotherm model. The result shows that rogers mushroom biomass has a good potential to be used in removal of metal ions and can be used up to three adsorption/desorption cycles without losing efficiency. Its use in real life situation can alleviate pollution and increase the quality of water for human consumption and sanitary purposes.", "Torrefaction of waste biomass for application in energy production in South Africa ": "Power producing plants are major emitters of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming and climate changes. In the past two to three decades, attention has been drawn to organizations such as these reduce their dependence on coal reserves which are depleting and focus on producing clean energy i.e. for every ton of fuel produced, 100\u00a0kg or more should be made from clean energy. This has made torrefaction to gain interest as it improves energy content of biomass, a renewable and clean energy source, to levels equal to and sometimes above that of coal. The benefit of this is that, torrefied biomass could be co-fired with coal thereby reducing greenhouse gases and global warming.\n                  In this study, the effect of different parameters were investigated on two abundant sources of biomass in South Africa. There parameters were temperature, oxygen content, heating rate and residence time. It was observed that a temperature range between 275 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C under inert conditions with a heating rate of 10\u00a0\u00b0C/min and residence time between 20 and 40\u00a0min were required to achieve the best biomass with properties comparable to those of coal. This made it possible to co-fire the biomass with coal for energy production at different proportions.", "Purification of residual glycerol recovered from biodiesel production ": "Transesterification is the most widely used reaction in the production of biodiesel. It involves the breaking of the triglyceride structure and the exchange of alkyl groups with the hydroxide groups of the alcohol to obtain the new ester (biodiesel). In this process residual glycerol is also produced, but since it is of low purity few alternatives for its application have been identified. In this context, a methodology for the purification of the residual glycerol was developed with a view to adding value to this product and making the process more economically attractive. In this study, residual glycerol was obtained from the transesterification of waste frying oil and of virgin soybean oil in bench scale. The purification method was also applied to residual glycerol obtained from a similar process on industrial scale. The product obtained after each step was characterized to evaluate the contribution of each unit of the operation to the quality of the final product. The results obtained show an increase in the degree of the glycerol purity in each step. It can thus be concluded that the method presented herein can be used to increase the quality of residual glycerol obtained from the biodiesel production process resulting in its acceptable commercial value.", "Studies on adsorption behavior of an industrial waste for removal of chromium from aqueous solution ": "An investigation on the adsorption characteristics of an industrial waste (Dolochar) for removal of Cr (VI) from aqueous solutions was studied varying various parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, adsorbate concentration, pH. The study was conducted varying contact time, adsorbent dose, adsorbate concentration, pH from 0 to 70\u00a0min, 10\u201325\u00a0g/l, 10\u201350\u00a0mg/l and 2 to 7.5 respectively. The results of this study showed that adsorption of chromium by dolochar reached to equilibrium after 60\u00a0min and after that a little change of chromium removal efficiency was observed. Maximum chromium removal (\u224895%) was obtained at pH of 2 for adsorbent and adsorbate dose of 20\u00a0g/l and 10\u00a0mg/l respectively. The obtained results showed that the adsorption of chromium (VI) follows Langmuir isotherm equation with a correlation coefficient equal to 0.997. In addition, the kinetics of the adsorption process follows the pseudo second-order kinetics model with a rate constant value of 0.821\u00a0min\u22121. Further, the potential of dolochar for the removal of heavy metal was evaluated in a fixed-bed column at bed depth of 2.5\u00a0cm with initial concentration of 10\u00a0mg/l. The breakthrough time and exhaust time were found to be 19.5\u00a0h and 90\u00a0h respectively. Total volume of water treated during the exhaust time was 23\u00a0L. The results indicate that this industrial waste can be employed as a low cost alternative to commercial adsorbents for removal of chromium (VI) from water and wastewater.", "Biological treatment of distillery wastewater by application of the vermifiltration technology ": "In this study distillery wastewater was treated using the vermifiltration technology in a bid to reduce downstream contamination by the effluent. 10\u202fkg of Eisenia fetida earthworms were used as the vermifiltration media in a 0.5\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5\u202fm x 0.3\u202fm vermifiltration bed over a 40\u202fh period cycle. The distillery effluent physicochemical parameters which included pH, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured every 5 days. The vermicompost which was produced as a result of the vermifiltration process's nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium composition was also determined. The distillery effluent pH changed from acidic to neutral whilst a decrease of 94.9% was observed for the TKN, 91.1% for the BOD, 91.9% for the TDS, 92.4% for the TSS and 89.4% for the COD upon treatment with vermifiltration. The vermicompost, a by-product of the vermifiltration process had a nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium composition of 1.87%, 0.87% and 0.66% respectively.", "Value addition of coal fines and sawdust to briquettes using molasses as a binder ": "In this study, the co-briquetting of coal fines saw dust and molasses as a binder is explored as an option for value addition of the wastes generated in the various industries. The effect of the saw dust concentration and the molasses concentration was investigated through measuring the briquette's calorific value, fixed carbon, compressive strength and shatter index. Addition of Ca(OH)2 was done to effect removal of sulphur from the briquette. Measurements of the briquettes physicochemical properties such as moisture content, ash content and sulphur content were measured using the standard methods. As the saw dust and the molasses concentration increased, the calorific value, fixed carbon and compressive strength increased by 16%, 8% and 50% respectively. Whereas, the shatter index decreased by 146% as the saw dust and the molasses concentration increased in relation to the coal fines. Addition of the saw dust and the molasses are therefore critical in the production of a high quality coal-saw dust-molasses briquette which does not shatter.", "Role of vortex finder depth on pressure drop and performance efficiency in a ribbed hydrocyclone ": "Hydrocyclones are devices used in many chemical and mineral based process industries for separation of fine particles. To enhance the performance efficiency of hydrocyclone with optimum pressure drop several configuration of hydrocyclone is designed and developed. A new hydrocyclone with spiral rib was designed. In the present study, the effects of spiral rib on pressure drop and separation efficiency are investigated experimentally and effect of vortex finder depth of a ribbed hydrocyclone was analyzed. The experimental results showed that the spiral rib has a significant effect on pressure drop and separation efficiency. It is interesting to note that by using a rib in the cylindrical part of the hydrocyclone resulted in lower pressure drop and improved separation efficiency. The pressure drop decreases by 17.5% and total efficiency increases by 10.5% at a feed velocity of 5\u202fm/s and at a vortex finder depth of 7.6\u202fcm. Pressure drop and separation efficiency also affected by the vortex finder depth. In this study, four ribbed hydrocyclones with 6\u202fcm, 7.6\u202fcm, 9.8\u202fcm and 12.5\u202fcm vortex finder depth have been taken for the analysis. Separation efficiency is maximum for the vortex finder depth of 7.6\u202fcm.", "Energy changes during use of high-power ultrasound on food grade surfaces ": "The energy changes experienced during application of high-power ultrasound in cleaning biofilms from food-grade surfaces was investigated in this study. Laboratory scale experiments were conducted using 24\u202fkHz ultrasound frequency with an ultrasonicator capable of operating in continuous mode at nominal ultrasound intensities up to 105\u202fW\u22c5cm\u22122. There are different energy changes that occur during its use; however, three types of energy changes were monitored: electrical to acoustical to cavitation, and the efficiency of conversion rate from one form of energy to the other was determined to ascertain the effectiveness of the process. High-power ultrasound do not leave residual chemicals behind after treatment and they reach hidden spots near and/or welds where biofilms thrives. A Nexus hydrophone was used to determine the electrical input energy and the cavitation energy but the calorimetric method was used to determine the acoustical energy. Values obtained for electrical power density were against the rated maximum amplitude displacement to compare the error when using the hydrophone. Results showed that the energy conversion was low, on average 26% from electrical to acoustical energy and 9% from electrical to cavitation. However, the values were in line with some of those reported in literature. It can be seen that high-power ultrasound does have a strong presence in the future for cleaning biofilms on food-grade surfaces.", "Optimisation of biodiesel production from waste vegetable oil and eggshell ash ": "While biodiesel has potential in resolving current energy crisis, its production is hampered by both feedstock and catalyst availability. The aim of this study is to investigate the production of biodiesel from waste vegetable oil (WVO) characterised by high free fatty acid (FFA) as feedstock with heterogeneous catalysis via transesterification reaction. The catalyst used was obtained from eggshell calcined at 800\u00a0\u00b0C. The properties of the catalyst were assessed using XRD, XRF, BET and SEM. The catalyst prepared was characterised to have large pore diameter of 91.2\u00a0\u00c5 and high surface area of 30.7\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121. The optimisation study was carried out by using a central composite response surface methodology with reaction conditions of methanol to oil ratio, catalyst loading and reaction temperature. The result showed at 95% confidence level that all the three factors affected the methyl ester yield. Significant yield of 91% was obtained at optimal operating conditions of temperature (65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C), methanol to oil molar ratio (22.5:1) reaction time (5\u00a0h 30\u00a0min) and catalyst loading (3.5\u00a0wt%).

The non-alcoholic drink sector has seen a tremendous growth of new products in recent times. Many of the new innovations include light versions of juices with lower calorie and carbohydrate content and an increase in the variety of juices that are used. In recent trends, consumers seek beverages or drinks that help improve on their health status due to the increasing rate of diseases and sicknesses hence most non-alcoholic drinks on the market have an additional value of health benefits. The aim of this work was to design a non-alcoholic drink product with functional properties to satisfy customer needs, ensuring that all safety, environmental and industrial regulations were taken into consideration. Customer needs in relation to functional fruit drink was identified through survey.

The environment is deteriorating daily due to industrial pollution. Dyes discharged together with industrial textile wastewaters are main organic pollutants because they are highly visible and undesirable even at low concentrations in water. Natural biomaterials have been applied previously as adsorbents for dyes from aqueous solution, but their application has been limited by low adsorption capacity. In this study, pine cone biomass, a naturally occurring agricultural waste was treated with 0.15\u202fM NaOH solution to remove unwanted plant extracts and iron oxide magnetic particles which was coated on the pine surface. The main focus of the study was to prepare and optimize the working conditions for the pine magnetite composite. The bionanocomposite material was synthesized by a complete co-precipitation method of Fe2+: Fe3+ (1:2) under alkaline conditions in an inert environment followed by addition of the biomass. The variables used for the experiments were volume of NH4OH varied from 5 to 40\u202fml, reaction temperature varied from 40 to 100\u202f\u00b0C, effect of time varied from 15 to 60\u202fmin and mass from 1.0 to 3.5\u202fg.

In the present study sewage wastewater (SWW) and industrial flue gas was supplied in batch and continuous mode for cultivation of microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. Chlorella vulgaris was very effective in reduction of chemical concentrations (COD, NO3\u00af, SO4\u00af, and PO4\u00af) in SWW along with flue gas (CO2, NOx and SOx). COD removal was achieved up to 78% in batch mode and 42% in continuous mode. The other nutrients from the sewage wastewater were removed up to 75% whereas, with continuous mode 55%. Concerning the flue gas treatment studies, Chlorella vulgaris removed CO2 up to 64% in batch mode and when grown in continuous mode it was up to 72%. The SOx and NOx concentrations were reduced up to 62% and 63% respectively in batch mode and the removal efficiencies of the same were 59% and 55% in continuous mode. Both batch and continuous mode showed the maximum biomass productivity in hetero and mixotrophic cultivations. While average biomass productivity in mixotrophic continuous mode was higher as 1.0\u202fg/L. Fourier infrared spectroscopy examination of algal biomass revealed the presence of \u2013OH, \u2013COOH, NH2, and\u202f=\u202fO organic compound groups.

Sewage sludge hydrolysate was first made by introducing Bacillus flexus in order for saccharification to take place before fermenting to bio ethanol using yeast. The hydrolysate was then prepared for fermentation by introducing 10\u202fg/L of peptone, 2\u202fg/L of KH2PO4 and 1\u202f\u202fg/L of MgSO4.

Bio ethanol concentrations were characterized through spectrophotometry and its physicochemical properties analyzed by standard methods. Pearson Correlations Coefficients in MATLAB 13.0 were used to determine the coefficients of interaction between the various parameters in bio ethanol production at 95% confidence interval. Highest bio ethanol yields of greater than 40 mL/L were achieved at an incubation period of 10 days, with an operating temperature of 30\u202f\u00b0C and pH of 6.5 with yeast concentration of 6% wt. The interactions between incubation temperature and pH had the best interaction coefficient of 0.9759 being achieved for optimal bio ethanol yield.

The effect of temperature and inhibitor concentration was studied using weight loss method. The result obtained shown that Xanthium \n                     strumarium leaves extracts act as an inhibitor for low carbon steel in HCl and reduces the corrosion rate. The inhibition efficiency was found to increases with increase in inhibitor concentration and temperature. Higher inhibition efficiency was 94.82% at higher level of inhibitor concentration and temperature. The adsorption of Xanthium \n                     strumarium leaves extracts was found to obey Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The values of the free energy of adsorption was more than \u221220\u00a0kJ/mol, which is indicative of mixed mode of physical and chemical adsorption.", "Prediction of maximum oil-yield from almond seed in a chemical industry: A novel type-2 fuzzy logic approach ": "Almond (Termanilia catappa) is one of the most popular tree nuts on a world-wide basis due to its huge benefits in human health. Since it is not readily available in every country, research and investigations are still going on this particular. Therefore, here we have developed a unique model using type-2 fuzzy logic controller (T2FLC) approach to predict the optimum process conditions for the extraction of oil at maximum from almond seeds. Here, we have taken pressure, temperature, heating time and moisture content as input parameters and oil yield is taken as an output parameter to optimize the process. Though hundred percent recovery of oil by extraction of almond seeds is never possible, but controlling the process parameters at suitable condition, oil yield may vary within the range of 40%\u201345%. Using these four input and one output parameters, four Mamdani fuzzy inference systems are formed depending on the different membership functions of the variables. In T2FLC assists to trace inputs and outputs in a well-organized manner for building the inferences train so that various types of oil yield and its assessment can be predicted during extraction. Finally, a statistical analysis has been done using type-2 fuzzy data set to improve the control of process parameters that can be easily determined in the type-2 fuzzy prediction model to get high yield.", "Simple method for functionalization of silica with alkyl silane and organic ligands ": "3\u2013(chloropropyl)triethoxysilane (CPTES) with imidazole and sodium silicate from rice husk ash (RHA) successfully reacted within a short time in one\u2013pot synthesis in purely homogenous method. A similar procedure was used for the immobilization of melamine and saccharine to demonstrate a generally applicable method. No reflux was needed, and a green solvent was used as the reaction medium. The surface areas of the prepared materials were very high compared with the materials which have similar structure prepared by the traditional method. The TGA/DTA confirmed that all the materials were highly stable. The FT-IR shows that all expected the functional groups were present. The HRTEM showed that the materials had ordered mesoporous straight-channels which were like the MCM-41. The synthesis procedure is simple, repeatable with different organic ligands and does not require toxic solvents or multiple steps with high products yield.", "Response surface methodology approach to optimization of process parameter for coagulation process of surface water using Moringa oleifera seed ": "Recent researches have linked the use of synthetic coagulant for treatment of water with some neurodegenerative and neurotoxic diseases. In view of this, this study focused on the use of an eco-friendly natural coagulant, Moringa oleifera seed for the treatment of surface water. In order to obtain lowest turbidity of surface water, optimization of process variable affecting the coagulation of water was carried out using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Four parameters were varied viz. settling time, agitation time, agitation speed and Moringa oleifera seed extract (MOSE) concentration and their effects on the turbidity of the surface water were established. The data obtained was fitted to a quadratic model which was also validated. The model predicted lowest turbidity of 5.49 NTU with optimal condition of 120\u202fmin of settling time, agitation speed of 100\u202frpm, 10\u202fmin of agitation time and 3\u202fg/l of MOSE concentration. The condition was verified in replicates and turbidity of 5.51 NTU was obtained. The result obtained from this study could be applied to industrial scale for treatment of water.", "Brewery wastewater treatment using laboratory scale aerobic sequencing batch reactor ": "This study evaluates the performance of two laboratory scale aerobic sequencing batch reactor operated under continuous low aeration and cyclic aeration scheme for the treatment of wastewater generated from a local brewery in Durban South Africa. The continuous low aeration scheme was intended to determine its effect on the performance of the reactor in terms of organic material removal compared to a typical cyclic aeration reactor for biological organic material removal. The performance of the two laboratory scale reactor was determined in terms of removals of chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand. These two parameters were selected because they are priority pollutants and organic components in brewery wastewater. The experimental results demonstrated that reductions in chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand in wastewater generated from the breweries can be successfully achieved using both aeration configurations. However, the treatment efficiencies in terms of the removal of chemical oxygen demand was consistently maintained above 90% and for biological oxygen demand it was observed to be above 80% with the reactor operated under the continuous low aeration scheme performing significantly better than the reactor operated under the cyclic aeration scheme.", "The effects of mixtures of potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) and isopropyl ethyl thionocarbamate (IPETC) collectors on grade and recovery in the froth flotation of a nickel sulfide ore ": "Potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) and sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX) are commonly used collectors in both the bulk and selective froth flotation of sulfide ores. These thiol xanthate collectors are conventionally mixed together as well as with more selective thiol collectors such as dithiophosphates (DTP) and dithiocarbamates (DTC), in order to improve selectivity. With deteriorating nickel sulfide ores, more selective collectors and collector mixtures are desired for the efficient extraction of nickel. Thionocarbamates (TC) are another group of thiol collectors used for selective froth flotation of sulfide minerals. Thionocarbamates are especially used in the selective froth flotation of chalcopyrite over pyrite and galena, but little is known about its selectivity with regards to nickel. Thionocarbamates are also more stable over larger pH ranges in comparison to xanthates and they possess beneficial frothing properties. This study compared the effects of using potassium amyl xanthate (PAX), isopropyl ethyl thionocarbamate (IPETC), sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX) and their mixtures in the froth flotation of a pentlandite ore. In the mixtures of PAX or SIBX with IPETC, the xanthate accounted for 95.5\u00a0mol% and for the PAX and SIBX mixture a 50:50 mixture was used. This study showed that the highest cumulative nickel grades were obtained with PAX, SIBX and there mixture. The highest cumulative nickel recoveries were obtained with IPETC and its mixtures with PAX and SIBX (50\u201362%).", "Anhydrous bio-ethanol produced from Elaeis Guineensis palm wine for use as a biodiesel feedstock ": "Biofuel is an important alternative to the limited resources of fossil fuels for use in power generation. Currently, regular alcohol is used as a feedstock; however, it is known to be toxic. Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate that anhydrous alcohol obtained from palm wine is a potential alternative as the main feedstock for biofuel production. In this study, the aim was to improve the anhydrous alcohol obtained from palm wine based on storage conditions. Although this type of anhydrous alcohol has been previously produced, it is demonstrated that the current method is more efficient than the previous one. The processes implemented in this study were fractionation and extractive distillation. Two numerical simulations were carried out using extractive distillation processes to evaluate of an ethanol and water mixture, that is, ethylene glycol or glyceride. The palm wine was characterized based on the determination of the alcohol content, pH, acidity and the content of free SO2. The alcohol produced was characterized through the determination of its concentration, viscosity and density and infrared spectroscopy analysis. The results illustrate that it is possible to obtain excellent quality anhydrous alcohol suitable for small biofuel production, which is increasingly in demand in rural villages in Sub-Saharan Africa.", "Comparative study of various carbon sources on rhamnolipid production ": "This study aimed at comparing the effect of various carbon sources with a fixed nitrogen source for the syntheses of rhamnolipid biosurfactant using a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The carbon sources used were glycerol, glucose and waste cooking oil (WCO), for the benefit of utilising wastes. The characterized microbial strain was obtained from the Microbiology Department of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. It was grown on a surface culture before inoculation into a production culture. Each culture media were sterilized at 121\u202f\u00b0C, 15 psi for 15\u202fmin and cooled before inoculation. Each procedure was carried out in duplicates and culture flasks incubated in a shaker for 7 days with 24-h monitoring. The growth of P. aeruginosa on the three carbon sources passed through the phases of formation of primary metabolites. The surface tensions of medium relative to water was reduced from 86.69\u202fmNm\u22121 to 33.63\u202fmNm\u22121, 36.44\u202fmNm\u22121 and 18.02\u202fmNm\u22121 for biosurfactant from use of glycerol, glucose and WCO as carbon sources respectively. Excellent emulsification index, E24, was obtained in the continuous media Heavy black oil and lubricating oil unlike in the other media: vegetable oil and kerosene. The FTIR spectra revealed that the glycerol- and glucose-based biosurfactants were di-substituted rhamnolipids with difference in the hydrophobic moieties. However, the biosurfactant formed with WCO was not a rhamnolipid but a lipopeptide.", "Analytic methods in accident research: Methodological frontier and future directions ": "The analysis of highway-crash data has long been used as a basis for influencing highway and vehicle designs, as well as directing and implementing a wide variety of regulatory policies aimed at improving safety. And, over time there has been a steady improvement in statistical methodologies that have enabled safety researchers to extract more information from crash databases to guide a wide array of safety design and policy improvements. In spite of the progress made over the years, important methodological barriers remain in the statistical analysis of crash data and this, along with the availability of many new data sources, present safety researchers with formidable future challenges, but also exciting future opportunities. This paper provides guidance in defining these challenges and opportunities by first reviewing the evolution of methodological applications and available data in highway-accident research. Based on this review, fruitful directions for future methodological developments are identified and the role that new data sources will play in defining these directions is discussed. It is shown that new methodologies that address complex issues relating to unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity, risk compensation, spatial and temporal correlations, and more, have the potential to significantly expand our understanding of the many factors that affect the likelihood and severity (in terms of personal injury) of highway crashes. This in turn can lead to more effective safety countermeasures that can substantially reduce highway-related injuries and fatalities.", "Unobserved heterogeneity and the statistical analysis of highway accident data ": "Highway accidents are complex events that involve a variety of human responses to external stimuli, as well as complex interactions between the vehicle, roadway features/condition, traffic-related factors, and environmental conditions. In addition, there are complexities involved in energy dissipation (once an accident has occurred) that relate to vehicle design, impact angles, the physiological characteristics of involved humans, and other factors. With such a complex process, it is impossible to have access to all of the data that could potentially determine the likelihood of a highway accident or its resulting injury severity. The absence of such important data can potentially present serious specification problems for traditional statistical analyses that can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates, erroneous inferences and erroneous accident predictions. This paper presents a detailed discussion of this problem (typically referred to as unobserved heterogeneity) in the context of accident data and analysis. Various statistical approaches available to address this unobserved heterogeneity are presented along with their strengths and weaknesses. The paper concludes with a summary of the fundamental issues and directions for future methodological work that addresses unobserved heterogeneity.", "Analyzing road crash frequencies with uncorrelated and correlated random-parameters count models: An empirical assessment of multilane highways ": "Recent literature on highway safety research has focused on methodological advances to minimize misspecifications and the potential for erroneous estimates and invalid statistical inferences. To further these efforts, this study carries out an empirical assessment of uncorrelated and correlated random-parameters count models for analyzing road crash frequencies on multilane highways considering two crash severities; injury and no-injury. The empirical results indicate that the relative statistical performance of these models is comparable; however, the correlated random-parameters approach accounts for both the heterogeneous effects of explanatory factors across the road segments and the cross-correlations among the random-parameter estimates. As noted in the results, statistically significant correlation effects among the random parameters confirm the adequacy of this approach. The safety models for multilane highways presented in this study can be useful in (i) the detection of critical risk factors on these road types, (ii) the assessment of crash reduction due to improvements in pavement condition and retrofitting of roadway geometric features and, (iii) the prediction of crash frequency while comparing different design alternatives. As such, the outcomes of this study may assist design engineers and highway agencies in designing new or calibrating existing multilane highways from a safety standpoint.", "Bayesian hierarchical modeling of the non-stationary traffic conflict extremes for crash estimation ": "A Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM) approach is used to model non-stationary traffic conflict extremes of different sites together for crash estimation. The hierarchical structure has three layers, a data layer that is modeled with a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, a latent Gaussian process layer that relates parameters of GEV to covariates and the unobserved heterogeneity, and a prior layer with prior distributions to characterize the latent process. The proposed approach was applied to traffic conflicts collected at the signal cycle level from four intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Traffic conflicts were measured by the modified time to collision (MTTC) indicator while traffic volume, shock wave area, average shock wave speed, and platoon ration of each cycle were employed as covariates. Four BHM models were developed, including a stationary model (i.e., BHM_GEV(0,0,0)) with no covariates and three non-stationary models (i.e., BHM_GEV(1,0,0), BHM_GEV(0,1,0), and BHM_GEV(1,1,0)) with covariates added to the location parameter, scale parameter, and both parameters of the GEV distribution, respectively. Traditional at-site GEV models were also developed for individual sites for comparison purposes. The results show that the BHM_GEV(1,1,0) is the best fitted model among the four models since considering covariates and unobserved heterogeneity significantly improves the model performance in terms of goodness of fit. The BHM_GEV(1,1,0) also yields relatively accurate and more precise crash estimates compared to the at-site models. This is attributed to the BHM_GEV(1,1,0) allowing borrowing strength from other sites. It is also found that the traffic volume, shock wave area, and platoon ratio have significant influence on the safety of signalized intersections.", "Comparing three commonly used crash severity models on sample size requirements: Multinomial logit, ordered probit and mixed logit models ": "There have been many studies that have documented the application of crash severity models to explore the relationship between accident severity and its contributing factors. Although a large amount of work has been done on different types of models, no research has been conducted about quantifying the sample size requirements for crash severity modeling. Similar to count data models, small data sets could significantly influence model performance. The objective of this study is therefore to examine the effects of sample size on the three most commonly used crash severity models: multinomial logit, ordered probit and mixed logit models. The study objective is accomplished via a Monte-Carlo approach using simulated and observed crash data. The results of this study are consistent with prior expectations in that small sample sizes significantly affect the development of crash severity models, no matter which type is used. Furthermore, among the three models, the mixed logit model requires the largest sample size, while the ordered probit model requires the lowest sample size. The sample size requirement for the multinomial logit model is located between these two models.", "Time-of-day variations and temporal instability of factors affecting injury severities in large-truck crashes ": "Using the data from large-truck crashes in Los Angeles over an eight-year period (January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017), the variation in the influence of factors affecting injury severities during different time periods of the day (morning and afternoon) and from year to year is studied. To capture potential unobserved heterogeneity, random parameters logit models with heterogeneity in the means and variances of the random parameters were estimated considering three possible crash injury-severity outcomes (no injury, minor injury, and severe injury). Likelihood ratio tests were conducted to assess the transferability of model estimation results from different times of the day and from year to year. Marginal effects of the explanatory variables were also calculated to investigate the stability of individual parameter estimates on injury-severity probabilities across time-of-day/time-period combinations. A wide range of parameters were considered including drivers\u2019 characteristics, driver actions, truck\u2019s characteristics, weather and environmental conditions, and roadway attributes. The results show instability in the effect of factors that influence injury severities in large-truck vehicle crashes across daily time periods and from year to year. However, there were several variables that exhibited relatively stable effects on injury-severity probabilities including driver ethnicity, crashes occurring while backing, sideswipe crashes, hit-object crashes, parked-vehicle crashes, fixed-object crashes, and truck-driver at fault crashes. The findings of this study should be useful for decision makers and trucking companies to better regulate truck operations by time of day.", "The effects of driver fatigue, gender, and distracted driving on perceived and observed aggressive driving behavior: A correlated grouped random parameters bivariate probit approach ": "Previous research has shown that the determinants of perceived and observed aggressive driving behavior may differ. However, the consideration of major sources of aggressive patterns may introduce additional variations in the effect of such determinants. This study aims to provide further insights in the variations of these two behavioral components arising from driver\u2019s fatigue, gender as well as internal and external distractions (such as, rushing to destination, listening to music and solving logical problems) during the driving task. To identify how the factors determining perceived and observed aggressive behavior may vary across groups of drivers associated with such sources of aggressive driving, survey and simulation data are statistically analyzed. Separate models of perceived and observed aggressive driving behavior are estimated for fatigued and non-fatigued, distracted and non-distracted, male and female drivers. To address various aspects of unobserved heterogeneity, associated with the unobserved variations that are commonly shared among the behavioral components and participants, as well as their unobserved interactions, the correlated grouped random parameters bivariate probit modeling framework is employed. The results of the empirical analysis showed that the effect of the socio-demographic and behavioral factors on perceived and aggressive driving behavior may vary across the aforementioned groups of drivers, in terms of magnitude and directional effect. In addition, the identification of correlation among the unobserved characteristics further illustrates the complexities of the driving decision mechanism, especially when fundamental sources of aggressive driving are evident.", "A hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal random parameters approach for alcohol/drug impaired-driving crash frequency analysis ": "Unobserved heterogeneity, which has been recognized as a critical issue in crash frequency modelling, generates from multiple sources, including observable and unobservable factors, space and time instability, crash severities, etc. However, only a very limited body of research is dedicated to distinguish and simultaneously address all these sources of unobserved heterogeneity. In this study, hierarchical Bayesian random parameters models with various spatiotemporal interactions are developed to address this issue. Selected for analysis are the yearly county-level alcohol/drug impaired-driving related crash counts data of three different injury severities including minor injury, major injury, and fatal injury in Idaho from 2010 to 2015. The variables, including daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT), the proportion of male (MALE), unemployment rate (UR), and the percentage of drivers of 25\u202fyears and older with a bachelor's degree or higher (BD), are found to have significant impacts on crash frequency and be normally distributed in certain crash severities. Significant temporal and spatial heterogenous effects are also detected in all three crash severities. These empirical results support the incorporation of temporal and spatial heterogeneity in random parameters models.", "Comprehensive evaluation of signal-coordinated arterials on traffic safety ": "Many cities have adopted signal coordination schemes to improve the operational efficiency of arterials. Through providing a \u201cgreen wave\u201d, the coordinated signals allow vehicles to pass consecutive intersections with fewer stops. Conventionally, studies focused mainly on the efficiency aspect of signal coordination. From a safety perspective, there are few studies devoted to investigating spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity simultaneously along arterials, particularly those with different traffic control and signal coordination schemes. Applying a joint negative binomial conditional auto-regression crash sum (JNBCS-CAR) model, this paper aims to comprehensively evaluate traffic safety on arterials with coordinated traffic signals. The performance of JNBCS-CAR is compared to those of traditional five ones (i.e., Poisson log-normal (PLN), negative binominal crash sum (NBCS), Poisson log-normal conditional auto-regression (PLN-CAR), negative binominal conditional auto-regression crash sum (NBCS-CAR), and hierarchical Poisson log-normal conditional auto-regression (HPLN-CAR)). Nine years of data are selected from the City of Ann Arbor (Michigan). Results indicate that (1) the JNBCS-CAR model outperforms other models in terms of the goodness-of-fit; (2) signalized intersections appear to have significant spatially heterogeneous effects on roadway segments under the scenario of signal coordination, while roadway segments do not have spatially heterogeneous effects on signalized intersections; and (3) there is a strong spatially homogeneous correlation among the coordinated intersections, but not among the segments. The findings serve to provide an accurate evaluation of the coordinated signalization from the safety perspective.", "Combining driving simulator and physiological sensor data in a latent variable model to incorporate the effect of stress in car-following behaviour ": "Car-following models, which are used to predict the acceleration-deceleration decisions of drivers in the presence of a closely spaced lead vehicle, are critical components of traffic microsimulation tools and useful for safety evaluation. Existing car-following models primarily account for the effects of surrounding traffic conditions on a driver\u2019s decision to accelerate or decelerate. However, research in human factors and safety has demonstrated that driving decisions are also significantly affected by individuals\u2019 characteristics and their emotional states like stress, fatigue, etc. This motivates us to develop a car-following model where we explicitly account for the stress level of the driver and quantify its impact on acceleration-deceleration decisions. An extension of the GM stimulus-response model framework is proposed in this regard, where stress is treated as a latent (unobserved) variable, while the specification also accounts for the effects of drivers\u2019 sociodemographic characteristics. The proposed hybrid models are calibrated using data collected with the University of Leeds Driving Simulator where participants are deliberately subjected to stress in the form of aggressive surrounding vehicles, slow leaders and/or time pressure while driving in a motorway setting. Alongside commonly used variables, physiological measures of stress (i.e. heart rate, blood volume pulse, skin conductance) are collected with a non-intrusive wristband. These measurements are used as indicators of the latent stress level in a hybrid model framework and the model parameters are estimated using Maximum Likelihood Technique. Estimation results indicate that car-following behaviour is significantly influenced by stress alongside speed, headway and drivers\u2019 characteristics. The findings can be used to improve the fidelity of simulation tools and designing interventions to improve safety.", "A marginalized random effects hurdle negative binomial model for analyzing refined-scale crash frequency data ": "Crash frequency prediction models have been an important subject of safety research that unveils a relationship between crash occurrences and their influencing factors. Recently, the hourly-based refined-scale crash frequency analysis becomes attractive since it holds the benefits of introducing time-varying explanatory information (e.g. traffic volume and operating speed). However, crash frequency data with short time intervals possess the analytical issues of excessive zeros and unobserved heterogeneity. In this study, a marginalized random effects hurdle negative binomial (MREHNB) model was, for the first time, developed in which the hurdle modelling structure handles the excessive zeros issue and site-specific random effect terms capture the factors associated with unobserved heterogeneity. Moreover, the marginalized inference approach was introduced here to obtain the marginal mean inference for the overall population rather than subject-specific estimations. Empirical analyses were conducted based on data from the Shanghai urban expressway system, and the MREHNB model was compared with the HNB (hurdle negative binomial) and the REHNB (random effects hurdle negative binomial) model. In terms of model goodness-of-fits, REHNB and MREHNB model showed substantial improvement compared to the HNB model while there was no distinct difference between the REHNB and MREHNB models. However, as for the estimated parameters, the MREHNB model provided better inference precisions. Furthermore, the MREHNB model provided interesting findings for the crash contributing factors, for example, higher ratios of local vehicles within the traffic volume would enhance the probability of crash occurrence; and a non-linear relationship was concluded between traffic volume and crash frequency with the moderate level of volume held the highest crash occurrence probability. Finally, in-depth analyses about the modeling results and the model technique were discussed. The results will assist in designing more efficient control strategies for near real-time traffic management.", "A statistical assessment of temporal instability in the factors determining motorcyclist injury severities ": "This study explores the temporal instability of factors affecting motorcyclist-injury severities in single-vehicle motorcycle crashes in Florida. Two data sources are used; one covers the 2012 to 2016 crash histories of Florida motorcyclists who were newly licensed in 2012, and the second covers motorcycle crashes that occur on horizontal curves in Florida from 2005 to 2015. In the first dataset (2012 new riders), temporal changes may result from riders gaining experience as well as general temporal shifts. In the second dataset, rider experience is unknown (thus becoming a source of potential unobserved heterogeneity) but the temporal changes will be largely from general temporal shifts. With three possible motorcyclist injury severity outcomes (no visible injury, minor injury, and severe injury), random parameters multinomial logit models, that allow for heterogeneity in means and variances, were estimated for all possible annual time periods in each dataset. Likelihood ratio tests were conducted to examine the overall stability of model estimates across time periods, and marginal effects of each explanatory variable were also considered to investigate the temporal instability of the effect of individual parameter estimates on motorcyclist injury-severity probabilities. A wide range of variables was considered including motorcyclists\u2019 attributes (such as ethnicity and age), roadway and environmental conditions (such as light and road surface conditions), motorcycle characteristics (such as motorcycle make and type of motorcycle), rider actions (such as speeding and improper driving actions), and roadway conditions (such as obstacles on the road and speed limits). The results show significant temporal instability in motorcyclist-injury severity models, which likely result from changes in motorcycle technology and performance, changes in macroeconomic conditions, changes induced by how riders respond to the changing behavior of other road users (whose behavior may be changing as a result of technology changes in their vehicles, evolving use of personal technologies in their vehicle, such as cell phones, etc.), and the changes in riders\u2019 behavior and skills over time.", "An exploratory investigation of public perceptions towards safety and security from the future use of flying cars in the United States ": "This study aims at investigating public perceptions towards the safety and security implications that will arise after the future introduction of flying cars in the traffic fleet. In this context, we focus on individuals\u2019 opinions about possible safety benefits and concerns as well as about policy measures that can potentially enhance the security of flying car. Due to the emergent nature and lack of public exposure of this technology, individuals\u2019 perceptions and opinions regarding flying cars might be subject to several layers of unobserved heterogeneity, such as shared unobserved variations across interrelated perceptions, grouped effects, and interactive effects between various sources of unobserved heterogeneity. To explore individuals\u2019 perceptions accounting, at the same time, for such heterogeneity patterns, grouped random parameters bivariate probit and correlated grouped random parameters binary probit models with heterogeneity in means are estimated. In this context, data collected from an online survey of 584 individuals from the United States are statistically analyzed. The estimation results revealed that a number of individual-specific socio-demographic, behavioral and driving attributes affect the perceptions towards the safety aspects of flying cars, along with the attitudes towards potential security interventions. Despite the exploratory nature of the analysis, the findings of this study can provide manufacturers, policy-makers and regulating agencies with valuable information regarding the integration and acceptance challenges that may arise with the introduction of flying cars.", "A preliminary investigation of the effectiveness of high visibility enforcement programs using naturalistic driving study data: A grouped random parameters approach ": "This paper seeks to assess the effectiveness of high-visibility enforcement (HVE) programs in terms of reducing aggressive driving behavior. Using Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) Naturalistic driving study (NDS) data, behavioral reactions of drivers before, during, and after the conduct of high-visibility enforcement programs are analyzed, in order to identify the potential effect of high-visibility enforcement in driving behavior. In this context, two fundamental aspects of aggressive driving behavior (speeding and tailgating) are employed and analyzed. To simultaneously explore the intensity and the duration of these behavioral patterns, novel metrics are defined and used in the analysis. To investigate the effect of high-visibility enforcement programs, and at the same time, to control for the effect of driver-, trip-, vehicle-, and weather-specific characteristics on the extent of speeding and tailgating, univariate grouped random parameters linear regression models are estimated. In addition, likelihoods of speeding and tailgating occurrences are analyzed simultaneously, within a grouped random parameters bivariate probit modeling framework. The results of this preliminary analysis show that even though the implementation of the high-visibility enforcement has mixed effects on the extent and the likelihood of the driving behavior metrics, it demonstrates a promising potential in modifying driving behavior.", "A multilevel generalized ordered probit fractional split model for analyzing vehicle speed ": "Vehicle operating speed plays a significant role in many fields of transportation engineering including safety, operation, design and management. The current research effort contributes to literature on examining vehicle speed on arterial roads methodologically and empirically. Specifically, we propose and estimate a panel mixed generalized ordered probit fractional split (PMGOPFS) model to examine critical factors contributing to vehicle operating speed on roadways. The proposed modeling framework allows for the exogenous variable impacts to vary across the alternatives. Further, the model is formulated to allow for the impact of common unobserved factors across multiple levels (roadway, segment, direction, day and time period). To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first time such an econometric model is proposed and estimated in any literature (not just in transportation). The proposed model is estimated employing a maximum simulated quasi-likelihood based objective function. Vehicular speed data obtained from 8 arterial roads in Orlando for the year 2016 is used for estimating the model. The data is obtained for weekday morning and evening peak and off-peak hours for one randomly chosen week for each roadway throughout the year. The exogenous variables that are considered in the current empirical study include geometry, roadway, traffic, land use and environmental attributes. The model estimation results are further augmented by conducting elasticity analysis to highlight the important factors affecting the vehicular speed profile.", "Temporal instability and the analysis of highway accident data ": "Virtually every statistical analysis of highway safety data is predicated on the assumption that the estimated model parameters are temporally stable. That is, the assumption that the effect of the determinants of accident likelihoods and resulting accident-injury severities do not change over time. This paper draws from research previously conducted in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, economics, and cognitive science to build a case for why we would not necessarily expect the effects of explanatory variables to be stable over time. The review of this literature suggests that temporal instability is likely to exist for a number of fundamental behavioral reasons, and this temporal instability is supported by the findings of several recent accident-data analyses. The paper goes on to discuss the implications of this temporal instability for contemporary accident-data modeling methods (unobserved heterogeneity, data driven, traditional, and causal inference methods) and concludes with a discussion of how temporal instability might be addressed and how its likely presence can be accounted for to better interpret accident data-analysis findings.", "Random parameters multivariate tobit and zero-inflated count data models: Addressing unobserved and zero-state heterogeneity in accident injury-severity rate and frequency analysis ": "This paper uses data collected over a five-year period between 2005 and 2009 in Indiana to estimate random parameters multivariate tobit and zero-inflated count data models of accident injury-severity rates and frequencies, respectively. The proposed modeling approach accounts for unobserved factors that may vary systematically across segments with and without observed or reported accident injury-severities, thus addressing unobserved, zero-accident state and non-zero-accident state heterogeneity. Moreover, the multivariate setting allows accounting for contemporaneous cross-equation error correlation for modeling accident injury-severity rates and frequencies as systems of seemingly unrelated equations. The tobit and zero-inflated count data modeling approaches address the excessive amount of zeros inherent in the two sets of dependent variables (accident injury-severity rates and frequencies, respectively), which are \u2013 in nature \u2013 continuous and discrete count data, respectively, that are left-censored with a clustering at zero. The random parameters multivariate tobit and zero-inflated count data models are counter-imposed with their equivalent fixed parameters and lower order models, and the results illustrate the statistical superiority of the presented models. Finally, the relative benefits of random parameters modeling are explored by demonstrating the forecasting accuracy of the random parameters multivariate models with the software-generated mean \n                        \n                           \u03b2\n                        \n                     s of the random parameters, and with the observation-specific \n                        \n                           \u03b2\n                        \n                     s of the random parameters.", "A multivariate spatial model of crash frequency by transportation modes for urban intersections ": "This study proposes a multivariate spatial model to simultaneously analyze the occurrence of motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian crashes at urban intersections. The proposed model can account for both the correlation among different modes involved in crashes at individual intersections and spatial correlation between adjacent intersections. According to the results of the model comparison, multivariate spatial model outperforms the univariate spatial model and the multivariate model in the goodness-of-fit. The results confirm the highly correlated heterogeneous residuals in modeling crash risk among motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. In regard to spatial correlation, the estimates of variance for spatial correlations of all three crash modes in the multivariate and univariate models are statistically significant; however, the correlations for spatial residuals between different crash modes at adjacent sites are not statistically significant. More interestingly, the results show that the proportion of variation explained by the spatial effects is much higher for motor vehicle crashes than for bicycle and pedestrian crashes, which indicates spatial correlations between adjacent intersections are significantly different between the motor vehicle and non-motorized modes.", "Multivariate random parameters zero-inflated negative binomial regression for analyzing urban midblock crashes ": "Urban midblock crashes are influenced mainly by traffic operation and roadway geometric features. In this paper, 10-year crash data from 1,506 directional urban midblock segments in Nebraska were analyzed using the multivariate random parameters zero-inflated negative binomial model to account for unobserved heterogeneity produced by correlations across segments, correlations across crash collision types, excessive zero crashes, and over dispersion. The multivariate random parameters zero-inflated negative binomial model was superior to many common crash frequency models in terms of both goodness of fit and prediction accuracy. Compared with the multivariate fixed parameters zero-inflated negative binomial model, the multivariate random parameters zero-inflated negative binomial model identified fewer key influencing factors and revealed segment-specific effects of these factors on different crash types. It showed that the number of lanes, annual average daily traffic per lane, and segment length might have non-positive effects on crash frequencies. Segments with a speed limit of 45\u202fmph had fewer crashes than did those with lower speed limits, and there were fewer crashes on the segments in Omaha than on those in Lincoln. It was also found that neither the presence of a shoulder, on-street parking, or one-way traffic, nor lane width had significant influences on crash frequencies. These findings are informative for transportation agencies to take correct and efficient measures to accommodate diverse transportation demands without reducing traffic safety. By contrast, the fixed parameters model produced results consistent with intuition, but the results were insufficient to provide actionable recommendations.", "Using the multivariate spatio-temporal Bayesian model to analyze traffic crashes by severity ": "Unobserved heterogeneity across space, time, and crash type is often non-negligible in crash frequency modeling. When multiple crash types with spatial and temporal features are analyzed, multivariate spatio-temporal models should be considered. For this study, we analyzed the yearly county-level fatal, major injury, and minor injury crashes in Iowa from 2006 to 2015 using a multivariate spatio-temporal Bayesian model. The model adopted a multivariate spatial structure, a multivariate temporal structure, and a multivariate spatio-temporal interaction structure to account for possible correlations across injury severities over space, time, and spatio-temporal interaction, respectively. Income and weather indicators were found to have no significant effects on crash frequencies in the presence of vehicle miles traveled and unemployment rate. Both spatial and temporal effects were found to be important, and they played nearly the same roles for all three crash types in the studied dataset. Counties located in north and southwest Iowa were found to tend to have fewer crashes than the remaining counties. All three crash types generally showed descending trends from 2006 to 2015. They also had significantly positive correlations between each other in space but not in time. The crude crash rates and predicted crash rates were generally consistent for major injury and minor injury crashes but not for low-count fatal crashes. High-risk counties were identified using the posterior expected rank by the predicted crash cost rate, which was more able to truly represent the underlying traffic safety status than the rank by the crude crash cost rate.", "Analysis of accident injury-severity outcomes: The zero-inflated hierarchical ordered probit model with correlated disturbances ": "In accident injury-severity analysis, an inherent limitation of the traditional ordered probit approach arises from the a priori consideration of a homogeneous source for the accidents that result in a no-injury (or zero-injury) outcome. Conceptually, no-injury accidents may be subject to the effect of two underlying injury-severity states, which are more likely to be observed in accident datasets with excessive amounts of no-injury accident observations. To account for this possibility along with the possibility of heterogeneity stemming from the fixed nature of the ordered probability thresholds, a zero-inflated hierarchical ordered probit approach with correlated disturbances is employed, for the first time \u2013 to the authors\u2019 knowledge \u2013 in accident research. The latter consists of a binary probit and an ordered probit component that are simultaneously modeled in order to identify the influential factors for each underlying injury-severity state. At the same time, the model formulation accounts for possible correlation between the disturbance terms of the two model components, and allows for the ordered thresholds to vary as a function of threshold-specific explanatory variables. Using injury-severity data from single-vehicle accidents that occurred in the State of Washington, from 2011 to 2013, the implementation potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated. The comparative assessment between the zero-inflated hierarchical ordered probit approach with correlated disturbances and its lower-order counterparts highlights the potential of the proposed approach to account for the effect of underlying states on injury-severity outcome probabilities and to explain more with the same amount of information.", "A random thresholds random parameters hierarchical ordered probit analysis of highway accident injury-severities ": "This study uses highway accident data collected in the State of Washington, between 2011 and 2013, to study the factors that affect accident injury-severities. To account for the fixed thresholds limitation of the traditional ordered probability models \u2013 which typically leads to incorrect estimation of outcome probabilities for the intermediate categories \u2013 and for the possibility of unobserved factors systematically varying across the observations, a random thresholds hierarchical ordered probit model with random parameters is estimated. This approach simultaneously allows the explanatory parameters to vary across roadway segments, and the thresholds to vary both as a function of explanatory parameters and across the observations, thus accounting for unobserved and threshold heterogeneity, respectively. Using goodness-of-fit measures, likelihood ratio tests and forecasting accuracy measures, the model estimation results are compared with the hierarchical and fixed thresholds ordered probit model counterparts, with fixed and random parameters. The comparative assessment among the ordered probit modeling approaches reveals the relative benefits and the overall statistical superiority of the random thresholds random parameters hierarchical ordered probit model.", "The effects of neighborhood characteristics and the built environment on pedestrian injury severity: A random parameters generalized ordered probability model with heterogeneity in means and variances ": "Transportation infrastructure facilities and pedestrian/driver behaviors are associated with neighborhood characteristics and the built environment. However, the effects of neighborhood characteristics and the built environment on pedestrian injury severity are not well documented. To investigate and quantify the effects of neighborhood characteristics and built environment on pedestrian injury severity, a random parameters generalized ordered probit model with heterogeneity in means and variances was proposed to consider the ordinal nature of injury data and the issue of threshold and unobserved heterogeneity. A total of 3867 pedestrian-vehicle crashes that occurred in Florida Department of Transportation District 7 from 2011 to 2014 were analyzed. Based on the estimation results, three factors (African American community, school zone, and bus stop area) related to neighborhood characteristics and the built environment were identified to have significant influence on pedestrian injury severity. Pedestrian-vehicle crashes that occurred in African American community or bus stop area are less likely to involve incapacitating and fatal injuries. The presence of a school within a 0.5-km buffer from a crash leads to a decreased probability of fatal injury and an increased probability of incapacitating injury. In addition, the estimated parameter for elderly pedestrian indicator (50<age\u226465) was found to be random with significant heterogeneity in both mean and variance (where the mean and variance are associated with intersection-related crash indicator). Compared to younger pedestrians (age\u226430), 74.3% of elderly pedestrians who are involved in intersection-related crashes are more likely to suffer severe injury (fatal or incapacitating injury), while 52.4% of elderly pedestrians who are not involved in intersection-related crashes are more likely to suffer severe injury.", "Investigating varying effect of road-level factors on crash frequency across regions: A Bayesian hierarchical random parameter modeling approach ": "This study aims to quantitatively examine the variations in effect of road-level factors on crash frequency across different regions. Treating the hierarchical structure existing in the crash data that road entity nested within the geographic region, a hierarchical random parameter model, which allows the coefficients of road-level variables to vary with regions, is proposed. A Poisson lognormal model and a hierarchical random intercept model are also built for the purpose of comparison. A specific roadway facility type, urban two-lane two-way roadway segments in Florida, with crash and road level data including traffic volume, road length, surface condition, and access density for three-year period are used for a case study. The result shows that, in the hierarchical-random parameter model, the local regression coefficients and marginal effects of the road level factors vary over a wide range in the selected counties, which clearly illustrates the non-stationary in the relationships between road level factors and crash frequency across the counties. In regard to the model comparison, the hierarchical random parameter model outperforms the Poisson lognormal model and the hierarchical random intercept model in term of deviance information criterion (DIC). This further confirms the necessity of the use of hierarchical random parameter model in analyzing the crash frequency for road entities in different regions. This study provides a potential in guidance of model construction that considers regional variations (heterogeneities) in safety effects of road-level factors.", "Calibration of an ultrasonic flow meter for hot water ": "If we want to keep the number of necessary characterisation measurements within acceptable limits, we need to be confident that a flow instrument design reacts in a predictable and straightforward way to systematic influences. In this paper, the important systematic influences for an ultrasonic flow meter (UFM) for feed water flow are identified to decide which characterisations have to be carried out in addition to a typical baseline calibration with water at 20 \u00b0C. In heat metering applications where there are temperatures up to 120 \u00b0C it is for example known that the temperature influence on the flow instrument is important and this also applies to higher temperatures such as in the feed water control of power plants. One of the critical systematic temperature influences that affects most flow instruments is the thermal expansion of the meter body. From June 2009 to March 2010, the \u201cHeat and Vacuum\u201d department of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt conducted a measurement campaign to characterise the influence of thermal expansion of a meter body on the calibration of an 8 inch (DN 200) five chord UFM for feed water application in the temperature range from 4 \u00b0C to 85 \u00b0C and flow range from 50 m3 h\u22121 to 900 m3 h\u22121. An overview of the procedures and facility used for the calibration is given and the measurement conditions under which the calibrations were performed are detailed. It is shown that a linear model of the thermal expansion effect is appropriate for the investigated conditions.", "In-situ water level measurement using NIR-imaging video camera ": "Water level is a critical component for observation and management of water resources. Since video surveillance is becoming a standard configuration of gauging stations, more attentions have been paid on the image-based water level measurement techniques in recent years. Instead of human eyes, images of staff gauge can be captured by a camera and automatically processed to detect the readings of water line. However, it is quite unreliable to identify the readings on staff gauges due to low imaging resolution, tilt viewing angle and complex illumination in field conditions. For that reason, most of the existing methods failed to make effective automatic measurements in practice. To resolve difficulties of poor visibility, image distortions and ambient noises in in-situ water level measurement with standard bicolor staff gauges, an all-weather, real-time and automatic flow measurement system using single near infrared (NIR)-imaging video camera is developed. Lab and in-situ experiments demonstrate that NIR-imaging is efficient to enhance image contrast and suppress reflection noises on the water surface, which successfully overcomes the limitation of water line detection with current visible light (VIS)-imaging systems in clear water and low velocity conditions. The proposed water level conversion method is based on image ortho-rectification. It requires no on-site calibration by utilizing natural corresponding points to build the perspective transformation between the staff gauge Region of Interest (ROI) and an orthographic template image. The measurement resolution of water level (1\u202fmm) is controlled by the physical resolution (1 mm/pixel) of the template. The proposed water line detection approach is integrated by a series of algorithms: the Order-Statistic Filtering for adaptive thresholding, the Morphological Opening Operation for local noise suppression, the Multi-points Continuity Criterion for water line locating and the Median Filtering for random noise elimination. It overcomes the deficiency of traditional Otsu method for images with uneven illumination. The reliability of system under various weather and illumination conditions is proved with water level accuracy up to 1\u202fcm and Effective Data Ratios up to 95%.", "Simulation-based determination of systematic errors of flow meters due to uncertain inflow conditions ": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides well-established tools for the prediction of the velocity profiles in turbulent pipe flows. As far as industrial pipe and district heating systems are concerned, combinations of elbows are the most common pipe assemblies. Among the different pipe combinations, double elbows out-of-plane are of special interest, since they introduce strong disturbances into the flow profile and have a strong influence on many common types of flow meters. In front of a double elbow there is often another flow-disturbing installation. As a result the upstream conditions are unknown and an investigation of the resulting systematic bias on the measurement of the flow rate and the associated contribution to its measurement uncertainty is necessary. We demonstrate here that this can be achieved by a variation of the inlet profile in terms of swirls and asymmetry components. In particular, an ultrasonic and an electromagnetic flow meter are modeled in order to quantify the systematic errors stemming from uncertain inflow conditions. For this purpose, a generalized non-intrusive polynomial chaos method has been used in conjunction with a commercial CFD code. As the most influential parameters on the measured volume flow, the distance between the double elbow and the flow meter as well as the orientation of the flow meter are considered as random variables in the polynomial chaos approach. This approach allowed us to obtain accurate prediction of the systematic error for the ultrasonic and electromagnetic meter as functions of the distance to the double elbow. The resulting bias in the flow rate has been found to be in the range of 1.5\u20134.5% (0.1\u20130.5%) with a systematic uncertainty contribution of 2\u20132.4% (0.6\u20130.7%) for the ultrasonic (electromagnetic) flow meter if the distance to the double elbow is smaller than 40 pipe diameters. Moreover, it is demonstrated that placing the flow meters in a Venturi constriction leads to substantial decrease of the bias and the contribution to the measurement uncertainty stemming from the uncertain inflow condition.", "Effects of varying orifice diameter and Reynolds number on discharge coefficient and wall pressure ": "In this paper, an experimental study has been performed to investigate the performance of varying diameter of orifice that made from acrylic plastic on the flow characteristics. A colour water has been used as a working fluid to flow through a PVC pipe system. The orifice has a sharp-edged with 30\u00b0 angle and the pipe system has thirty tapping points across the orifice for the pressure measurement. The experiments have been carried out for different beta ratio and Reynolds number. The results clearly demonstrated that the beta ratio has a positive effects on the discharge coefficient particularly at the laminar flow regime whereas it has inversely effects on pressure head losses. Therefore, geometric parameters are required to be properly designed in order to achieve the desired objective. It has been also found that the orifice discharge coefficient reduces with increasing in Reynolds number for all values of beta ratio especially at the turbulent flow regime and hence adequate must be taken while designing such orifice. The results obtained in the present study have been compared with that predicted from an empirical correlations and they show a good agreement between them. Finally, a statistical analysis has been carried out in order to determine a fitting correlation for the discharge coefficient based on the present experimental data.", "Evaluation of discharge equations of the piano key weirs ": "In present scenario, Piano key weir has played a vital role in increasing the discharge capacity of the available dams. This modified weir is the replacement of creaky and conventional labyrinth weir and it is best suited for the low head dams. This new labyrinth type weir is utmost solution for the rehabilitation of the spillways all across the globe. There are various equations available for the estimation of coefficient of discharge of Piano key weir. The present study encapsulates about the observable fact of coefficient of discharge for the Piano key weir and assigns different procedure for its evaluation. The validation of the four existing equations given by the investigators for the coefficient of discharge is monitored in the study. The graphical representation and statistical perusal of the equations given by the investigators show that the relationship proposed by Crookston et al.; Cicero and Delisle predict coefficient of discharge better than other equations for the data sets used in this present study. For these two equations 97% results lie within \u00b120% error lines. The present experimental study is also compared with the relationships given by the previous investigators. The equation suggested by Crookston et al. estimates coefficient of discharge effectively for all ranges of H/P, whereas the equation proposed by Cicero and Delisle is slightly more efficient for H/P between 0.2 and 0.8.", "Automated extraction of free surface topography using SfM-MVS photogrammetry ": "This paper describes a spatial measurement technique to measure the free surface of natural fluid flows in laboratory applications. This effective solution is based on \u201cStructure-from- Motion/Multi-view Stereo\u201d (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry and is capable of reconstructing water surface morphology, both at an instant and with a high spatial resolution. The efficiency and accuracy of the method is dependent upon the acquisition of high quality imagery (i.e. sharply focussed, no motion blur) with appropriate multi-frame camera coverage and configuration, and data processing must utilise appropriate camera calibration data. The potential of the technique for developing hydraulic understanding is demonstrated using two contrasting approaches. First, the water surface behind a living vegetation element is analysed along a single transect. Second, the full three-dimensional characteristics of the captured water surfaces are examined using statistical methods which demonstrate surface dissimilarity between vegetated and non-vegetated cases. The technique is transferable to real-world field sites.", "Identification of gas-liquid flow regimes using a non-intrusive Doppler ultrasonic sensor and virtual flow regime maps ": "The accurate prediction of flow regimes is vital for the analysis of behaviour and operation of gas/liquid two-phase systems in industrial processes. This paper investigates the feasibility of a non-radioactive and non-intrusive method for the objective identification of two-phase gas/liquid flow regimes using a Doppler ultrasonic sensor and machine learning approaches. The experimental data is acquired from a 16.2-m long S-shaped riser, connected to a 40-m horizontal pipe with an internal diameter of 50.4\u202fmm. The tests cover the bubbly, slug, churn and annular flow regimes. The power spectral density (PSD) method is applied to the flow modulated ultrasound signals in order to extract frequency-domain features of the two-phase flow. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is then used to reduce the dimensionality of the data so as to enable visualisation in the form of a virtual flow regime map. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) is deployed to develop an objective classifier in the reduced space. The classifier attained 85.7% accuracy on training samples and 84.6% accuracy on test samples. Our approach has shown the success of the ultrasound sensor, PCA-SVM, and virtual flow regime maps for objective two-phase flow regime classification on pipeline-riser systems, which is beneficial to operators in industrial practice. The use of a non-radioactive and non-intrusive sensor also makes it more favorable than other existing techniques.", "Optimum design, simulation and test of a new flow control valve with an electronic actuator for turbine engine fuel control system ": "This paper presents the design and experimental implementation of a new rotary proportional flow control valve. This valve is equipped with a needle valve for fine adjusting and a plunger type adjustable pressure compensating valve to retaining constant pressure difference across it. The plunger in flow control valve is directly coupled to an electronic servomotor as a rotary actuator. The modified new opening shape of the flow metering area is two trapezoids with fixed height and variable base. This area forms by the intersection of two triangle ports on the sleeve and two rectangular ports on the plunger. This configuration is used as a flow metering unit in a gas turbine engine fuel control system. The output metered flow is proportional to the flow control valve\u2019s angular position and it is not sensitive to pressure variations across the valve. Because of linear relation between the output fuel flow and valve position (throttle position), this unit is used as a variable area fuel flow meter device in engine control system. The aim of this new design is to change and modify a manual fuel control unit with a set point and to develop a throttleable electrohydraulic fuel control system for more precise control of a turbine engine at high altitudes. The main innovations in the present fuel metering unit include the modified and new design of the rotary valve opening shape(s), use of a rotary electronic actuating mechanism and also direct coupling of the actuator and the flow control valve with a simple spline coupling. Using the direct drive actuation of flow control valve, instead of the more common hydro mechanical mechanisms, has reduced the number of parts. And made the whole system lighter and cut down on the manufacturing cost. The increased fuel metering precision in the new flow control valve has increased the ultimate control accuracy of the system. In order to acquire the optimal design parameters, the proposed system has been modeled and simulated for different operating conditions. After manufacturing a prototype of the unit, it has been tested on a special test rig. To validate the model, the test results has been compared with the simulation results. This comparison shows the maximum deviation of about 4% between the simulation results and empirical tests.", "Measurement of steam quality using a vortex flowmeter ": "The velocity of steam through a pipeline can be measured using a vortex flowmeter. In this paper, the question of whether the same instrument can be used to measure steam quality has been addressed using two approaches. In the first, the signal from a single pickup was studied spectrally, and the width of its peak was related to steam quality. In the second approach, two piezoelectric pickups were placed in tandem downstream of a shedder bar from which vortices were shed due to steam flow. The phase lag between the two at the shedding frequency was evaluated as a marker for steam quality. Though the former approach has been previously studied, it was found to be more robust than the latter across a range of steam pressures and flowrates.", "A new visualisation and measurement technology for water continuous multiphase flows ": "This paper reports the performance of a research prototype of a new multiphase flow instrument to non-invasively measure the phase flow rates, with the capability to rapidly image the flow distributions of two- and three-phase (gas and/or oil in water) flows. The research prototype is based on the novel concepts of combining vector Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) sensor (for measuring dispersed-phase velocity and fraction) with an electromagnetic flow metre (EMF, for measuring continuous-phase velocity with the EIT input) and a gradiomanometer flow-mixture density metre (FDM), in addition to on-line water conductivity, temperature and absolute pressure measurements. EIT\u2013EMF\u2013FDM data fusion embedded in the research prototype, including online calibration/compensation of conductivity change due to the change of fluids' temperature or ionic concentration, enables the determination of mean concentration, mean velocity and hence the mean flow rate of each individual phase based on the measurement of dispersed-phase distributions and velocity profiles. Results from first flow-loop experiments conducted at Schlumberger Gould Research (SGR) will be described. The performance of the research prototype in flow-rate measurements are evaluated by comparison with the flow-loop references. The results indicate that optimum performance of the research prototype for three-phase flows is confined within the measuring envelope 45\u2013100% Water-in-Liquid Ratio (WLR) and 0\u201345% Gas Volume Fraction (GVF). Within the scope of this joint research project funded by the UK Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), only vertical flows with a conductive continuous liquid phase will be addressed.", "Study of mechanical choked Venturi nozzles used for liquid flow controlling ": "Motivated by the principles of the cavitating Venturi nozzle (CVN) used for controlling fluid flow and addressing limitations of CVN, this paper proposes a mechanical choked Venturi nozzle (MCVN) which achieves choking flow via a mechanical action. The MCVN is constructed by inserting a floating springed blockage into a Venturi nozzle to imitate the bubble dynamics of CVN. First, an initial MCVN design was derived theoretically. Then, using numerical simulation and an iterative procedure, this original design was corrected to build an optimized design. Finally, the optimized design was investigated and tested both numerically and experimentally. The experimental results show that the MCVN can maintain constant flow with a flow control error of 3.8% and a maximum back pressure ratio of 0.97. Since MCVN can achieve constant flow without fluid vaporization, the pressure ratio range for applying a choking flow device is expanded and some limitations of CVN are overcome. The principles and experimental results obtained in this research can be used as a framework for the design of improved constant flow control devices for liquid flow.", "Optical flow for image-based river velocity estimation ": "We present a novel motion estimation technique for image-based river velocimetry. It is based on the so-called optical flow, which is a well developed method for rigid motion estimation in image sequences, devised in computer vision community. Contrary to PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) techniques, optical flow formulation is flexible enough to incorporate physics equations that govern the observed quantity motion. Over the past years, it has been adopted by experimental fluid dynamics community where many new models were introduced to better represent different fluids motions, (see [18] for a review). Our optical flow is based on the scalar transport equation and is augmented with a weighted diffusion term to compensate for small scale (non-captured) contributions. Additionally, since there is no ground truth data for such type of image sequences, we present a new evaluation method to assess the results. It is based on trajectory reconstruction of few Lagrangian particles of interest and a direct comparison against their manually-reconstructed trajectories. The new motion estimation technique outperformed traditional optical flow and PIV-based methods.", "Qualification of an ultrasonic flow meter as a transfer standard for measurements at Reynolds numbers up to 4\u00d7106 between NMIJ and PTB ": "The quality of any laboratory intercomparison depends to a large extent on the performance of the used flow meter. To find a flow meter that is capable of reaching a reproducibility better than 0.05% requires bounding all involved influence quantities down to the required level. The present paper describes the efforts performed while qualifying a time-of-flight ultrasonic flow meter as a transfer standard. It was determined that the most relevant influence quantity besides the flow profile within the bulk flow is the effect caused by the transducer pockets in the meter body. By taking advantage of a specially designed window chamber, it was possible to determine the magnitude of the errors introduced by the transducer pockets and to define, based on the findings, a procedure to perform a bilateral comparison between the hot water calibration facilities of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. The results of the bilateral comparison are presented.", "Predicting the coefficient of discharge for piano key side weirs using GMDH and DGMDH techniques ": "Piano Key Side Weirs (PKSW) are new devices that are used to discharge the additional flow in hydraulic structures. The main objective of performing these structures is to enhance the performance of the traditional side weirs. In this paper based on GMDH and DGMDH methods, discharge coefficient (Cd) of PKSW has been predicted and compared using experimental data. To this end 239 experiments were conducted on type-C of PKSWs in rigid curved channel. Data were collected in two position angles on the curved channel, namely; 30\u00b0 and 120\u00b0. Results of Cd (after data normalization) obtained by the mentioned two methods showed that the algorithm DGMDH presents a better performance than the other technique. In fact, R2, MAE and RMSE values for testing data in DGMDH technique are 0.938, 0.0372 and 0.053, respectively, while these values for GMDH are 0.875, 0.0501 and 0.0792, respectively.", "Estimation of bubble size distributions and shapes in two-phase bubble column using image analysis and optical probes ": "A precise estimation of bubble size distributions and shapes is required to characterize the bubble column fluid dynamics at the \u201cbubble-scale\u201d, and to evaluate the heat and mass transfer rate in bubble column reactors. Image analysis methods can be used to measure the bubble size distributions and shapes; unfortunately, these experimental techniques are limited to resolve bubble clusters and large void fractions, and can not be applied under relevant operating conditions (e.g., high temperature and pressure). On the other hand, needle probes (i.e, optical and conductive probes) can be used to measure bubble sizes in dense bubbly flows and under relevant operating conditions; however, needle probes measure chord length distributions, which should be converted into bubble size distributions by using statistical algorithms. These algorithms rely on correlations\u2014generally obtained for single droplets/bubbles\u2014that predicts the bubble shapes, by relating the bubble equivalent diameter to the bubble aspect ratio. In this paper, we contribute to the existing discussion through an experimental study regarding the bubble sizes and aspect ratio in a large air-water bubble column. The experimental investigation has consisted in gas holdup, image analysis and optical probe measurements. First, the gas holdup measurements have been used to identify the flow regime transition between the homogeneous flow regime and the transition flow regime. Secondly, the homogeneous flow regime has been described at the \u201cbubble-scale\u201d: chord length distributions and bubble size distributions have been obtained by using an optical probe and image analysis, respectively. Based on the experimental data from the image analysis, a correlation between the bubble equivalent diameter and the bubble aspect ratio has been proposed and has been compared with existing correlations. Finally, the chord length distributions have been converted into bubble size distributions using a statistical method, supported by the aspect ratio obtained through image analysis. The proposed approach has been able to estimate correctly the bubble size distributions at the center of the column then near the wall. We have also demonstrated that the correlations used to predicts the bubble shapes are the main point of improvement in the method.", "On the pressure losses through perforated plates ": "Perforated plates are widely used in pipeline systems either to reduce flow nonuniformities or to attenuate the onset and the development of cavitation. This experimental work aims at investigating the dependence of the pressure losses through sharp-edged perforated plates with respect to the geometrical and flow key parameters. The data, collected in two large experimental campaigns carried out on different pilot plants, are reported and discussed. Several plates with different geometrical characteristics were tested. More precisely, perforated plates whose equivalent diameter ratio varies between 0.20 and 0.72; relative hole thickness between 0.20 and 1.44; and number of holes between 3 and 52. Experimental data from literature are also considered in order to ensure the reliability of the parametric investigation. The dependence of the pressure loss coefficient upon the Reynolds number, the equivalent diameter ratio, the relative thickness, and the number and disposition of the holes is studied. A comparison to different empirical equations, as available by the technical literature, and to the standard ISO 5167-2 single-hole orifice is also provided.", "Uncertainty evaluation for velocity\u2013area methods ": "Velocity\u2013area methods are used for flow rate calculation in various industries. Applied within a fully turbulent flow regime, modest uncertainties can be expected. If the flow profile cannot be described as \u201clog-like\u201d, the recommended measurement positions and integration techniques exhibit larger errors. To reduce these errors, an adapted measurement scheme is proposed. The velocity field inside a Venturi contour is simulated using computational fluid dynamics and validated using laser Doppler anemometry. An analytical formulation for the Reynolds number dependence of the profile is derived. By assuming an analytical velocity profile, an uncertainty evaluation for the flow rate calculation is performed according to the \u201cGuide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement\u201d. The overall uncertainty of the flow rate inside the Venturi contour is determined to be 0.5% compared to \n                        \u2248\n                        0.67\n                        %\n                      for a fully developed turbulent flow.", "Application of soft computing techniques to multiphase flow measurement: A review ": "After extensive research and development over the past three decades, a range of techniques have been proposed and developed for online continuous measurement of multiphase flow. In recent years, with the rapid development of computer hardware and machine learning, soft computing techniques have been applied in many engineering disciplines, including indirect measurement of multiphase flow. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the soft computing techniques for multiphase flow metering with a particular focus on the measurement of individual phase flowrates and phase fractions. The paper describes the sensors used and the working principle, modelling and example applications of various soft computing techniques in addition to their merits and limitations. Trends and future developments of soft computing techniques in the field of multiphase flow measurement are also discussed.", "Hybrid simulation of a segmental orifice plate ": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become a popular tool in the development of flow meters as an alternative to cost-intensive prototyping while preparing for approval tests or particular disturbances in pipe systems. In practical CFD applications, a turbulence model is required to predict the influence of turbulent flow features. Unfortunately, even the most state-of-the-art and commonly used turbulence models \u2013 the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models \u2013 perform rather poorly in complex and separated flows, while scale-resolving methods such as large eddy simulations (LES) remain unfeasible for most industrial applications and higher Reynolds numbers. To make use of LES accuracy and current computing capacities nonetheless, the utilization of hybrid RANS-LES methods represents an efficient solution today.\n                  In this paper, we present a modified stress-blended eddy simulation (SBES) turbulence model capable of making reliable predictions of disturbed pipe flows and the resulting effects on flow meter measurements demonstrated by simulating a segmental orifice plate and its influence on an ultrasonic meter. To illustrate the differences, the SBES results are compared to those of a standard k-\n                        \u03c9\n                      RANS model. Typical mesh requirements and solver settings are discussed. Also, a spatially dependent blending function for SBES is introduced. Both simulations are compared to a large number of laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) and ultrasonic clamp-on measurements performed on a gravimetrically traceable flow test facility. The comparison with LDA shows the clear superiority of SBES, where RANS fails due to a massive overestimation of the recirculation zone. Near the orifice, SBES even has an advantage over LDA in predicting the ultrasonic meter performance.", "Artificial intelligence models for prediction of the aeration efficiency of the stepped weir ": "Stepped weir is a commonly used hydraulic structure in water treatment plants to enhance the air-water transfer of oxygen or nitrogen and volatile organic components. The flow regimes on stepped weir are classified into nappe, transition and skimming flow. This study presents the novel application of artificial intelligence methods to evaluate the aeration efficiency over stepped weir for the three flow regimes. Two methods were adopted in this study, namely, the evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) and the M5 model tree (M5 MT). A total of 151 laboratory experimental data sets were collected from the literature to train and test the artificial intelligence models. The Mallow's coefficient CP was used to determine the effective variables affecting aeration efficiency. It was found that weir steps number, slope, the flow Reynolds number, and the ratio of the critical flow depth to the step height are the most important variables providing the lowest Cp. Both the EPR and M5 MT methods provided satisfactory predictions for the aeration efficiency. The two methods have high values of correlation coefficient R>\u202f0.93 and low values for the root mean square error RMSE<\u202f0.052 and relative mean absolute error RMAE<\u202f0.065. However, the EPR method has an advantage over the M5 MT method that it provides one equation for each regime, while the M5 MT method provides a number of equations for each regime. This will make the equations of the EPR method more attractive to the practitioners compared to the equations of the M5 MT method. It was found that the equations obtained from artificial intelligence methods in this study perform better than the currently existing equations in the litrature obtained from regressive methods.", "Acoustic signal processing with robust machine learning algorithm for improved monitoring of particulate solid materials in a gas flowline ": "The flow of particulate solid materials in a gas flowline can significantly erode mechanical equipment. Hence, real-time quantitative monitoring is a timely need for the oil and gas industry to achieve real-time control and production optimisation. Although a considerable amount of research has been conducted employing acoustic signals for qualitative monitoring, there is still an unmet demand for a simple and robust real-time quantitative monitoring system. Acoustic signal processing with machine learning is a simple and robust method that has the potential to meet this demand but has not been previously exploited for real-time quantitative monitoring of particulate solid materials in a gas flowline. This paper proposes a novel instrumentation system for on-line measurement of solid flow rate, solid concentration, line pressure drop and gas velocity in a gas-solid multiphase flow using acoustic sensing technology coupled with signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithm. The acoustic sensor is used to capture the acoustic wave emitted from the impingements of the solid particles on the bend component of the flowline. Signal processing techniques are used to extract relevant features about the impingements. An integrated, conventional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to capture the distribution of the acoustic feature vectors in order to establish the relationship between the measurands and the acoustic signal. However, conventional ANNs are mainly concerned with capturing systematic patterns in a distribution of measurements fixed in time and in this case the dynamics of the generated acoustic signal varies with time. A modification, called Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is used to capture such dynamics. The proposed system compares the performance of the classical ANN and the TDNN models. Results obtained demonstrate that with the classical ANN, the normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) is 0.66, 0.29, 0.26 and 0.46 for the solid flow rate, solid concentration, line pressure drop and gas velocity respectively. With the TDNN model, the NRMSE is 0.18, 0.17, 0.20 and 0.16 for the solid flow rate, solid concentration, line pressure drop and gas velocity respectively. In comparison with the ANN model, the TDNN model has better performance as the NRMSE values are lower for all the models for the measurands. Overall, this study lays the basis for employing signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithm in the development of a simple, reliable and low cost real-time quantitative particulate solid flow monitoring system.", "Combining measurements with models for superior information in hydropower plants ": "Water flow and pressure measurements play essential roles in the operation of hydropower plants. For all methods of measuring flow and pressure, there is a level of uncertainty with regards to sensor noise and sensor failure. In addition, measurements in key locations are hard to obtain. A combination of measurements with a mathematical model of a hydropower plant can be used to improve information about and operation of the hydropower system.\n                  This paper describes the possibility of using nonlinear estimators such as Ensemble or Unscented Kalman filters in order to estimate the states of the hydropower system based on water flow and/or pressure measurements. The implementation of the estimators is done in Python using a Python API for operating OpenModelica simulations, where the hydropower system is modeled using an in-house hydropower Modelica library \u2014 OpenHPL.", "Measurement of velocity profiles in multiphase flow using a multi-electrode electromagnetic flow meter ": "This paper describes an electromagnetic flow meter for velocity profile measurement in single phase and multiphase flows with non-uniform axial velocity profiles. A Helmholtz coil is used to produce a near-uniform magnetic field orthogonal to both the flow direction and the plane of an electrode array mounted on the internal surface of a non-conducting pipe wall. Induced voltages acquired from the electrode array are related to the flow velocity distribution via variables known as \u2018weight values\u2019 which are calculated using finite element software. Matrix inversion is used to calculate the velocity distribution in the flow cross section from the induced voltages measured at the electrode array. This paper presents simulations and experimental results including, firstly the effects of the velocity profile on the electrical potential distribution, secondly the induced voltage distribution at the electrode pair locations, and thirdly the reconstructed velocity profile calculated using the weight values and the matrix inversion method mentioned above. The flow pipe cross-section is divided into a number of pixels and, in the simulations, the mean flow velocity in each of the pixels in single phase flow is calculated from the measured induced voltages. Reference velocity profiles that have been investigated in the simulations include a uniform velocity profile and a linear velocity profile. The results show good agreement between the reconstructed and reference velocity profiles. Experimental results are also presented for the reconstructed velocity profile of the continuous water phase in an inclined solids-in-water multiphase flow for which the axial water velocity distribution is highly non-uniform. The results presented in this paper are most relevant to flows in which variations in the axial flow velocity occur principally in a single direction.", "Two-stage compound channel and best hydraulic section ": "A Two-stage compound channel section is commonly used in ecological channel design. This paper presents the geometric properties of the compound section and the formulae for calculating the cross-section area, wetted perimeter are obtained. Then, the explicit equations of the best hydraulic section for design are derived. Results show the best width-depth ratio of the compound section is related to some geometric parameters. Furthermore, this type of best hydraulic section is compared with the rectangular and trapezoidal sections. Results indicate that the cross-section area and wetted perimeter are less than those of rectangular and trapezoidal sections for a given flow discharge when the ratios of the compound section's roughness coefficient to those of rectangular and trapezoidal sections are less than 1.017 and 0.855, respectively. It means less lining and excavation cost is required for construction.", "An improved particle image velocimetry method for efficient flow analyses ": "This study proposes a spatiotemporally Adaptive Search Area (SA) size selecting algorithm for Particle image velocimetry (PIV), ASAPiv. The presented method releases the constraint of conventionally used static SAs, offering a significant computational performance increase through optimizing the dimensions of the SA according to the local flow conditions in a transient manner. The algorithm is implemented as a part of a new PIV framework, developed within the MATLAB environment. The most relevant steps of PIV and the related methods are reviewed, starting from image pre-processing up to the post-processing of raw PIV results. The performance of the proposed algorithm and the PIV tool in general is demonstrated through three examples of different nature, including a synthetic image sequence, a conventional, laser illuminated PIV case and a large-scale, field application. The dynamic alteration of the SAs is found to be consistent with the prevailing flow conditions, while the accuracy of PIV in general is maintained. Total calculation times with static and dynamic SAs are compared. The benchmark cases highlight the relevance of adaptive SAs in cases of spatiotemporally varied flow conditions, where significant (up to 900%) computational performance increase is achieved. In case of unidirectional, steady flow conditions the method offers moderate speed-up compared to the employment of static SA sizes."}
