{"An implementation of artificial neural-network potentials for atomistic materials simulations: Performance for TiO2\n             ": "Machine learning interpolation of atomic potential energy surfaces enables the nearly automatic construction of highly accurate atomic interaction potentials. Here we discuss the Behler\u2013Parrinello approach that is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and detail the implementation of the method in the free and open-source atomic energy network (\u00e6net) package. The construction and application of ANN potentials using \u00e6net is demonstrated at the example of titanium dioxide (TiO2), an industrially relevant and well-studied material. We show that the accuracy of lattice parameters, energies, and bulk moduli predicted by the resulting TiO2 ANN potential is excellent for the reference phases that were used in its construction (rutile, anatase, and brookite) and examine the potential\u2019s capabilities for the prediction of the high-pressure phases columbite (\u03b1-PbO2 structure) and baddeleyite (ZrO2 structure)."}{"A computer vision approach for automated analysis and classification of microstructural image data ": "The \u2018bag of visual features\u2019 image representation was applied to create generic microstructural signatures that can be used to automatically find relationships in large and diverse microstructural image data sets. Using this representation, a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to classify microstructures into one of seven groups with greater than 80% accuracy over 5-fold cross validation. In addition, the bag of visual features was implemented as the basis for a visual search engine that determines the best matches for a query image in a database of microstructures. These novel applications demonstrate the potential and the limitations of computer vision concepts in microstructural science."}{"Sol\u2013gel based materials for biomedical applications ": "Sol\u2013gel chemistry offers a flexible approach to obtaining a diverse range of materials. It allows differing chemistries to be achieved as well as offering the ability to produce a wide range of nano-/micro-structures. The paper commences with a generalized description of the various sol\u2013gel methods available and how these chemistries control the bulk properties of the end products. Following this, a more detailed description of the biomedical areas where sol\u2013gel materials have been explored and found to hold significant potential. One of the interesting fields that has been developed recently relates to hybrid materials that utilize sol\u2013gel chemistry to achieve unusual composite properties. Another intriguing feature of sol\u2013gels is the unusual morphologies that are achievable at the micro- and nano-scale. Subsequently the ability to control pore chemistry at a number of different length scales and geometries has proven to be a fruitful area of exploitation, that provides excellent bioactivity and attracts cellular responses as well as enables the entrapment of biologically active molecules and their controllable release for therapeutic action. The approaches of fine-tuning surface chemistry and the combination with other nanomaterials have also enabled targeting of specific cell and tissue types for drug delivery with imaging capacity."}{"Current status of recycling of fibre reinforced polymers: Review of technologies, reuse and resulting properties ": "A complete review of the different techniques that have been developed to recycle fibre reinforced polymers is presented. The review also focuses on the reuse of valuable products recovered by different techniques, in particular the way that fibres have been reincorporated into new materials or applications and the main technological issues encountered. Recycled glass fibres can replace small amounts of virgin fibres in products but not at high enough concentrations to make their recycling economically and environmentally viable, if for example, thermolysis or solvolysis is used. Reclaimed carbon fibres from high-technology applications cannot be reincorporated in the same applications from which they were recovered, so new appropriate applications have to be developed in order to reuse the fibres. Materials incorporating recycled fibres exhibit specific mechanical properties because of the particular characteristics imparted by the fibres. The development of specific standards is therefore necessary, as well as efforts in the development of solutions that enable reusers to benefit from their reinforcement potential. The recovery and reuse of valuable products from resins are also considered, but also the development of recyclable thermoset resins. Finally, the economic and environmental aspects of recycling composite materials, based on Life Cycle Assessment, are discussed."}{"A review on selective laser sintering/melting (SLS/SLM) of aluminium alloy powders: Processing, microstructure, and properties ": "Manufacturing businesses aiming to deliver their new customised products more quickly and gain more consumer markets for their products will increasingly employ selective laser sintering/melting (SLS/SLM) for fabricating high quality, low cost, repeatable, and reliable aluminium alloy powdered parts for automotive, aerospace, and aircraft applications. However, aluminium powder is known to be uniquely bedevilled with the tenacious surface oxide film which is difficult to avoid during SLS/SLM processing. The tenacity of the surface oxide film inhibits metallurgical bonding across the layers during SLS/SLM processing and this consequently leads to initiation of spheroidisation by Marangoni convection. Due to the paucity of publications on SLS/SLM processing of aluminium alloy powders, we review the current state of research and progress from different perspectives of the SLS/SLM, powder metallurgy (P/M) sintering, and pulsed electric current sintering (PECS) of ferrous, non-ferrous alloys, and composite powders as well as laser welding of aluminium alloys in order to provide a basis for follow-on-research that leads to the development of high productivity, SLS/SLM processing of aluminium alloy powders. Moreover, both P/M sintering and PECS of aluminium alloys are evaluated and related to the SLS process with a view to gaining useful insights especially in the aspects of liquid phase sintering (LPS) of aluminium alloys; application of LPS to SLS process; alloying effect in disrupting the surface oxide film of aluminium alloys; and designing of aluminium alloy suitable for the SLS/SLM process. Thereafter, SLS/SLM parameters, powder properties, and different types of lasers with their effects on the processing and densification of aluminium alloys are considered. The microstructure and metallurgical defects associated with SLS/SLM processed parts are also elucidated by highlighting the mechanism of their formation, the main influencing factors, and the remedial measures. Mechanical properties such as hardness, tensile, and fatigue strength of SLS/SLM processed parts are reported. The final part of this paper summarises findings from this review and outlines the trend for future research in the SLS/SLM processing of aluminium alloy powders."}{"Progress in material selection for solid oxide fuel cell technology: A review ": "Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) have emerged as energy conversion devices in achieving high efficiency of over 70% with regeneration. The critical components of SOFC include anode, electrolyte, and cathode. However, for a stack of individual SOFCs, the evaluation of sealants and interconnects are also essential. In this review article, material selection, fundamentals of operation and underlying mechanisms, processing, microstructural and phase characterization, and the functionality and performance of individual SOFC components are presented in detail. The major challenges and complexity in functional section of SOFC include: (i) poisoning via sulfur and coke deposition, surface diffusion of adsorbate, and charge transfer at triple-phase boundary (TPB) in anode, (ii) hindered O2\u2212 migration that converts chemical energy into electrical energy in the solid electrolyte (thus, the creation of ion transfer channels, ease of O2\u2212 migration, dissociation of vacancy around dopants, straining of lattice, and other factors such as control of phase and its distribution, grain and grain boundary conductivity, become critical in designing the electrolytes for SOFCs), (iii) multiple rate determining factors such as geometry of active surfaces, and existence of overpotential, in cathode (thereby, comprehensive electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is required for the analysis of solid cathodes in SOFC), (iv) chemical incompatibility and instability in both oxidizing and reducing environments while matching the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the interconnects in order to sustain large number of thermal cycling during the operation of SOFC, and (v) isolation of the fuel and oxidizing gases while matching the CTE of the anode, cathode and interconnects, using sealant. Moreover, the glass-transition of sealant dictates the maximum allowable working temperature of SOFC. Thus, the necessitated temporal progress in material selection along with a detailed insight into the conceptual role of thermodynamics and kinetics of surface/cell reactions, effect of phases and microstructure on conductivity, fuel flexibility and deterioration in performance of individual fuel cell components, and evolution of new materials are coherently presented. This article provides a comprehensive review with respect to the structure, chemistry, design and selection of materials, underlying mechanisms, and performance of each SOFC component, and it opens up the future directions towards pursuing SOFC research."}{"Perspectives on oblique angle deposition of thin films: From fundamentals to devices ": "The oblique angle configuration has emerged as an invaluable tool for the deposition of nanostructured thin films. This review develops an up to date description of its principles, including the atomistic mechanisms governing film growth and nanostructuration possibilities, as well as a comprehensive description of the applications benefiting from its incorporation in actual devices. In contrast with other reviews on the subject, the electron beam assisted evaporation technique is analyzed along with other methods operating at oblique angles, including, among others, magnetron sputtering and pulsed laser or ion beam-assisted deposition techniques. To account for the existing differences between deposition in vacuum or in the presence of a plasma, mechanistic simulations are critically revised, discussing well-established paradigms such as the tangent or cosine rules, and proposing new models that explain the growth of tilted porous nanostructures. In the second part, we present an extensive description of applications wherein oblique-angle-deposited thin films are of relevance. From there, we proceed by considering the requirements of a large number of functional devices in which these films are currently being utilized (e.g., solar cells, Li batteries, electrochromic glasses, biomaterials, sensors, etc.), and subsequently describe how and why these nanostructured materials meet with these needs."}{"Synthesis of carbon nanotubes by catalytic chemical vapour deposition: A review on carbon sources, catalysts and substrates ": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been extensively studied during the past two decades and Catalytic Chemical Vapour Deposition (CCVD) technique has been untiredly employed by researchers to produce CNTs of various crystallographic configurations. In this paper the material aspects carbon sources, catalysts and substrates with regard to CCVD synthesis of carbon nanotubes are reviewed in light of latest developments and understandings in the field. The role of these materials in synthesis of CNTs is explained keeping the upto date literature in view. Latest research reports and their findings are presented with regard to effects of growth control aspects such as temperature, vapour pressure and catalyst concentration on CNT formation. Besides recent understandings with regard to preferential growth of CNTs are also discussed. From this literature review it is found that carbon diffusibility and carbon solubility of any catalyst are two important factors in determining CNT nucleation and growth. Moreover, addition of catalyst species to any transition metal catalyst can improve the catalyst performance and addition of water, air, alcohol etc. during CCVD process can increase the activity and lifetime of the catalyst besides enhances the production of CNTs."}{"A review of solar and visible light active TiO2 photocatalysis for treating bacteria, cyanotoxins and contaminants of emerging concern ": "Research into the development of solar and visible light active photocatalysts has been significantly increased in recent years due to its wide range of applications in treating contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), bacteria and cyanotoxins. Solar photocatalysis is found to be highly effective in treating a wide range of CECs from sources such as pharmaceuticals, steroids, antibiotics, phthalates, disinfectants, pesticides, fragrances (musk), preservatives and additives. Similarly, a number of EDCs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylphenols (APs), bisphenol A (BPA), organotins (OTs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), natural and synthetic estrogenic and androgenic chemicals, pesticides, and heavy metals can be removed from contaminated water by using solar photocatalysis. Photocatalysis was also found effective in treating a wide range of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Micrococcus lylae. The current review also compares the effectiveness of various visible light activated TiO2 photocatalysts for treating these pollutants. Doping or co-doping of TiO2 using nitrogen, nitrogen\u2013silver, sulphur, carbon, copper and also incorporation of graphene nano-sheets are discussed. The use of immobilised TiO2 for improving the photocatalytic activity is also presented. Decorating titania photocatalyst with graphene oxide (GO) is of particular interest due to GO's ability to increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. The use GO to increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 against microcystin-LR (MC-LR) under UV-A and solar irciation is discussed. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of GO\u2013TiO2 compared to the control material is attributed to the effective inhibition of the electron\u2013hole recombination by controlling the interfacial charge transfer process. It is concluded that there is a critical need for further improvement of the efficiency of these materials if they are to be considered for bulk industrial use."}{"Ni\u2013Cu interdiffusion and its implication for ageing in Ni-coated Cu conductors ": "After heat treatment at 400\u00b0C the effective resistivities of typical Ni-coated Cu conductor wires increased by up to 6.9% as a result of Ni\u2013Cu interdiffusion. Direct Ni\u2013Cu interdiffusion experiments were performed between metal foils at temperatures of 400\u2013600\u00b0C for times up to 192h. Calculated activation energies were in range 80\u201390kJmol\u22121, consistent with a grain boundary diffusion mechanism. Analysis of published Ni\u2013Cu interdiffusion coefficients suggested a clear dependence on grain size and grain shape. A concentric circle model was developed to simulate changes in composition and effective resistivity in the Ni\u2013Cu wires as a function of time. It was predicted that it would take 1.4\u00d7105\n                     h at 400\u00b0C for 10% increase in the effective resistivity of an AWG18-Class27 conductor wire. Good agreement between simulated and experimental data for effective resistivity was only achieved by employing effective diffusion coefficients corrected for microstructural effects."}{"Mechanical behavior of additive manufactured, powder-bed laser-fused materials ": "Mechanical behavior of four metallic alloys fabricated with layered, laser-heated methods of additive manufacturing (AM) was compared to that of similar alloys produced with conventional methods (wrought and machined). AM materials were produced by a leading commercial service provider, as opposed to incorporating material specimens produced by unique or specially-adapted equipment. The elastic moduli were measured in flexure, stress\u2013strain characteristics were measured in tensile deformation, and fatigue strengths were measured in fully reversed bending. The effects of fabrication orientation, surface polishing, and hot isostatic pressing upon mechanical behavior were studied.\n                  The fatigue strengths exhibited by SLM AlSi10Mg and DMLS Ti6Al4V in the as-fabricated condition proved to be significantly inferior to that of conventional material. These lower fatigue strengths are a consequence of multiple fatigue cracks initiating at surface defects, internal voids and microcracks, and growing simultaneously during cyclic loading. Measured fatigue strengths of DMLS 316L and 17-4PH approached those of corresponding wrought materials when subjected to principal stresses aligned with the build planes. When cyclic stresses were applied across the build planes of the DMLS stainless steels, fatigue fractures often developed prematurely by separation of material. Post-processing the DMLS Ti6Al4V and SS316L with hot isostatic pressure elevated the fatigue strength significantly. Measurements of surface roughness with an optical profilometer, examinations of the material microstructures, and fractography contribute to an understanding of the mechanical behavior of the additive materials."}{"Effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Inconel 718 processed by selective laser melting ": "The microstructural and mechanical properties of Inconel 718 were determined on the specimens manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) of prealloyed powder. High- density (99.8%) cylindrical specimens were built with four orientations (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 45\u00b0\u00d745\u00b0 and 90\u00b0) in relation to the building and scanning directions. Because of directional, dendritic-cellular grain growth, microstructure of the as-built specimens was characterized by columnar grains of supersaturated solid solution with internal microsegregation of Nb and Mo, demonstrated by fractions of Laves eutectic or its divorced form in interdendritic regions. Such a heterogeneous microstructure is unsuitable for direct post-process aging and makes the alloy sensitive to subsolidus liquation during rapid heating to the homogenizing temperature. In homogenized and aged condition, the alloy received a very good set of mechanical properties in comparison with the wrought material. In heat-treated condition, like in as-built condition, weak anisotropy of properties was found, manifested by lower Young's modulus, yield strength and tensile strength of the specimens extended along the build direction in comparison to the values for the other variants of the specimens. This is attributed to the fact that the grains maintained their geometric and crystallographic texture obtained during solidification."}{"Determination of Johnson cook material and failure model constants and numerical modelling of Charpy impact test of armour steel ": "The behaviour of typical armour steel material under large strains, high strain rates and elevated temperatures needs to be investigated to analyse and reliably predict its response to various types of dynamic loading like impact. An empirical constitutive relation developed by Johnson and Cook (J\u2013C) is widely used to capture strain rate sensitivity of the metals. A failure model proposed by Johnson and Cook is used to model the damage evolution and predict failure in many engineering materials. In this work, model constants of J\u2013C constitutive relation and damage parameters of J\u2013C failure model for a typical armour steel material have been determined experimentally from four types of uniaxial tensile test. Some modifications in the J\u2013C damage model have been suggested and Finite Element simulation of three different tensile tests on armour steel specimens under dynamic strain rate (10\u22121\n                     s\u22121), high triaxiality and elevated temperature respectively has been done in ABAQUS platform using the modified J\u2013C failure model as user material sub-routine. The simulation results are validated by the experimental data. Thereafter, a moderately high strain rate event viz. Charpy impact test on armour steel specimen has been simulated using J\u2013C material and failure models with the same material parameters. Reasonable agreement between the simulation and experimental results has been achieved."}{"Effect of standard heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of selective laser melting manufactured Inconel 718 superalloy ": "Inconel 718 superalloy has been fabricated by selective laser melting technology (SLM). Its microstructure and mechanical properties were studied under solution+aging (SA) standard heat treatment, homogenization+solution+aging (HSA) standard heat treatment and as-fabricated conditions. Precipitated phases and microstructures were examined using OM, SEM, TEM and X-ray analysis methods. The fine dendrite structures with an average dendrite arm spacing of approximately 698nm accompanying some interdendritic Laves phases and carbide particles can be observed in the as-fabricated materials. After standard heat treatments, dendrite microstructures are substituted by recrystallization grains, and Laves phases also dissolve into the matrix to precipitate strengthening phases and \u03b4 particles. The test values of all specimens meet Aerospace Material Specification for cast Inconel 718 alloy, and the transgranular ductile fracture mode exists for the three conditions. The strength and hardness of heat-treated SLM materials increase and are comparable with wrought Inconel 718 alloy, whereas their ductility decreases significantly compared with the as-fabricated material. This is because of the precipitation of fine \u03b3\u02ca and \u03b3\u301estrengthening phases and needle-like \u03b4 phases. For the as-fabricated alloy, the formation of finer dislocated cellular structures that develop into a ductile dimple fracture shows excellent ductility. Due to dislocation pinning from \u03b3\u02ca and \u03b3\u301estrengthening phases and the impediment of dislocation motion caused by the needle-like \u03b4 phases, the ductility of the SA materials decreases and causes a transgranular fracture, compared with the as-fabricated samples."}{"Classification, processing and application of hydrogels: A review ": "This article aims to review the literature concerning the choice of selectivity for hydrogels based on classification, application and processing. Super porous hydrogels (SPHs) and superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) represent an innovative category of recent generation highlighted as an ideal mould system for the study of solution-dependent phenomena. Hydrogels, also termed as smart and/or hungry networks, are currently subject of considerable scientific research due to their potential in hi-tech applications in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, bioseparation, biosensor, agriculture, oil recovery and cosmetics fields. Smart hydrogels display a significant physiochemical change in response to small changes in the surroundings. However, such changes are reversible; therefore, the hydrogels are capable of returning to its initial state after a reaction as soon as the trigger is removed."}{"Determining the mechanical properties of electrospun poly-\u03b5-caprolactone (PCL) nanofibers using AFM and a novel fiber anchoring technique ": "Due to its low cost, biocompatibility and slow bioresorption, poly-\u03b5-caprolactone (PCL) continues to be a suitable material for select biomedical engineering applications. We used a combined atomic force microscopy (AFM)/optical microscopy technique to determine key mechanical properties of individual electrospun PCL nanofibers with diameters between 440\u20131040nm. Compared to protein nanofibers, PCL nanofibers showed much lower adhesion, as they slipped on the substrate when mechanically manipulated. We, therefore, first developed a novel technique to anchor individual PCL nanofibers to micrometer-sized ridges on a substrate, and then mechanically tested anchored nanofibers. When held at constant strain, tensile stress relaxed with fast and slow relaxation times of 1.0\u00b10.3s and 8.8\u00b13.1s, respectively. The total tensile modulus was 62\u00b126MPa, the elastic (non-relaxing) component of the tensile modulus was 53\u00b136MPa. Individual PCL fibers could be stretched elastically (without permanent deformation) to strains of 19\u201323%. PCL nanofibers are rather extensible; they could be stretched to a strain of at least 98%, and a tensile strength of at least 12MPa, before they slipped off the AFM tip. PCL nanofibers that had aged for over a month at ambient conditions became stiffer and less elastic. Our technique provides accurate nanofiber mechanical data, which are needed to guide construction of scaffolds for cells and other biomedical devices."}{"Fabrication of scalable and structured tissue engineering scaffolds using water dissolvable sacrificial 3D printed moulds ": "One of the major challenges in producing large scale engineered tissue is the lack of ability to create large highly perfused scaffolds in which cells can grow at a high cell density and viability. Here, we explore 3D printed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a sacrificial mould in a polymer casting process. The PVA mould network defines the channels and is dissolved after curing the polymer casted around it. The printing parameters determined the PVA filament density in the sacrificial structure and this density resulted in different stiffness of the corresponding elastomer replica. It was possible to achieve 80% porosity corresponding to about 150cm2/cm3 surface to volume ratio. The process is easily scalable as demonstrated by fabricating a 75cm3 scaffold with about 16,000 interconnected channels (about 1m2 surface area) and with a channel to channel distance of only 78\u03bcm. To our knowledge this is the largest scaffold ever to be produced with such small feature sizes and with so many structured channels. The fabricated scaffolds were applied for in-vitro culturing of hepatocytes over a 12-day culture period. Smaller scaffolds (6\u00d74mm) were tested for cell culturing and could support homogeneous cell growth throughout the scaffold. Presumably, the diffusion of oxygen and nutrient throughout the channel network is rapid enough to support cell growth. In conclusion, the described process is scalable, compatible with cell culture, rapid, and inexpensive."}{"Humic acids: Structural properties and multiple functionalities for novel technological developments ": "Humic acids (HAs) are macromolecules that comprise humic substances (HS), which are organic matter distributed in terrestrial soil, natural water, and sediment. HAs differ from the other HS fractions (fulvic acid and humins) in that they are soluble in alkaline media, partially soluble in water, and insoluble in acidic media. Due to their amphiphilic character, HAs form micelle-like structures in neutral to acidic conditions, which are useful in agriculture, pollution remediation, medicine and pharmaceuticals. HAs have undefined compositions that vary according to the origin, process of obtainment, and functional groups present in their structures, such as quinones, phenols, and carboxylic acids. Quinones are responsible for the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HAs, which are useful for wound healing and have fungicidal/bactericidal properties. Phenols and carboxylic acids deprotonate in neutral and alkaline media and are responsible for various other functions, such as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of HAs. In particular, the presence of phenolic groups in HAs provides antioxidant properties due to their free radical scavenging capacity. This paper describes the main multifunctionalities of HAs associated with their structures and properties, focusing on human health applications, and we note perspectives that may lead to novel technological developments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to address this topic from this approach."}{"A comprehensive review of Li4Ti5O12-based electrodes for lithium-ion batteries: The latest advancements and future perspectives ": "Advanced electrical energy storage technology is a game changer for a clean, sustainable, and secure energy future because efficient utilization of newable energy hinges on cost-effect and efficient energy storage. Further, the viability of many emerging technologies depends on breakthroughs in energy storage technologies, including electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and smart grids. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), a great success in the portable electronics sector, are believed also the most promising power sources for emerging technologies such as EVs and smart grids. To date, however, the existing LIBs (with LiCoO\n                        x\n                      cathode and graphite anode) are still unable to meet the strict requirements for safety, cycling stability, and rate capability. The development of advanced anode materials, which can overcome the shortcomings of graphite anode (such as formation of dendritic lithium during charge and undesirable solid electrolyte interface), is of critical importance to enhancing the cycling stability and operational safety of LIBs. Lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) has recently attracted considerable attentions as a potential anode material of LIBs for high power applications due to several outstanding features, including a flat charge/discharge plateaus (around 1.55V vs. Li/Li+) because of the two-phase lithium insertion/extraction mechanism and minimum chance for the formation of SEI and dendritic lithium, dramatically enhance the potential for high rate capability and safety. In addition, there is almost no volume change during the lithium insertion and extraction processes, ensuring a high cycling stability and long operational life. However, the electronic conductivity of Li4Ti5O12 is relatively low, resulting in large polarization lose, more so at higher cycling rates, and poor rate performance. Currently, considerable research efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Li4Ti5O12 at fast charge/discharge rates, and some important progresses have been made. In this review, we first present a general overview of the structural features, thermodynamic properties, transport properties, and the electrochemical behavior of Li4Ti5O12 under typical battery operating conditions. We then provide a comprehensive review of the recent advancements made in characterization, modification, and applications of Li4Ti5O12 electrodes to LIBs, including nanostructuring, surface coating, morphological optimization, doping, and rational design of composite electrodes. Finally, we highlight the critical challenges facing us today and future perspectives for further development of Li4Ti5O12-based electrodes. It is hoped that this review may provide some useful guidelines for rational design of better electrodes for advanced LIBs."}{"Stimulus-responsive hydrogels: Theory, modern advances, and applications ": "Over the past century, hydrogels have emerged as effective materials for an immense variety of applications. The unique network structure of hydrogels enables very high levels of hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, while at the same time exhibiting the soft physical properties associated with living tissue, making them ideal biomaterials. Stimulus-responsive hydrogels have been especially impactful, allowing for unprecedented levels of control over material properties in response to external cues. This enhanced control has enabled groundbreaking advances in healthcare, allowing for more effective treatment of a vast array of diseases and improved approaches for tissue engineering and wound healing. In this extensive review, we identify and discuss the multitude of response modalities that have been developed, including temperature, pH, chemical, light, electro, and shear-sensitive hydrogels. We discuss the theoretical analysis of hydrogel properties and the mechanisms used to create these responses, highlighting both the pioneering and most recent work in all of these fields. Finally, we review the many current and proposed applications of these hydrogels in medicine and industry."}{"Measurement of fracture toughness by nanoindentation methods: Recent advances and future challenges ": "In this paper, we describe recent advances and developments for the measurement of fracture toughness at small scales by the use of nanoindentation-based methods including techniques based on micro-cantilever, beam bending and micro-pillar splitting. A critical comparison of the techniques is made by testing a selected group of bulk and thin film materials. For pillar splitting, cohesive zone finite element simulations are used to validate a simple relationship between the critical load at failure, the pillar radius, and the fracture toughness for a range of material properties and coating/substrate combinations. The minimum pillar diameter required for nucleation and growth of a crack during indentation is also estimated. An analysis of pillar splitting for a film on a dissimilar substrate material shows that the critical load for splitting is relatively insensitive to the substrate compliance for a large range of material properties. Experimental results from a selected group of materials show good agreement between single cantilever and pillar splitting methods, while a discrepancy of \u223c25% is found between the pillar splitting technique and double-cantilever testing. It is concluded that both the micro-cantilever and pillar splitting techniques are valuable methods for micro-scale assessment of fracture toughness of brittle ceramics, provided the underlying assumptions can be validated. Although the pillar splitting method has some advantages because of the simplicity of sample preparation and testing, it is not applicable to most metals because their higher toughness prevents splitting, and in this case, micro-cantilever bend testing is preferred."}{"Influence of thermal-decomposition temperatures on structures and properties of V2O5 as cathode materials for lithium ion battery ": "Submicron spherical V2O5 particles with a uniform size and a lower crystallinity were successfully synthesized by a chemical precipitation\u2013thermal decomposition technique using the commercial V2O5 powders as starting material. The crystal structure and grain morphology of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Electrochemical testing such as discharge\u2013charge cycling (CD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were employed in evaluating their electrochemical properties as cathode materials for lithium ion battery. Results reveal that the crystallinity and crystalline size of V2O5 particles increased when the thermal-decomposition temperature increased from 400\u00b0C to 500\u00b0C, and their adhesiveness was also synchronously increased. This indicates that the thermal-decomposition temperature played a significant influence on electrochemical properties of V2O5 cathodes. The V2O5 sample obtained at 400\u00b0C delivered not only a high initial discharge capacity of 330mAhg\u22121 and also the good cycle stability during 50 cycles due to its higher values of \u03b1 in crystal structure and better dispersity in grain morphology."}{"XCT analysis of the influence of melt strategies on defect population in Ti\u20136Al\u20134V components manufactured by Selective Electron Beam Melting ": "Selective Electron Beam Melting (SEBM) is a promising powder bed Additive Manufacturing technique for near-net-shape manufacture of high-value titanium components. However without post-manufacture HIPing the fatigue life of SEBM parts is currently dominated by the presence of porosity. In this study, the size, volume fraction, and spatial distribution of the pores in model samples have been characterised in 3D, using X-ray Computed Tomography, and correlated to the process variables. The average volume fraction of the pores (<0.2%) was measured to be lower than that usually observed in competing processes, such as selective laser melting, but a strong relationship was found with the different beam strategies used to contour, and infill by hatching, a part section. The majority of pores were found to be small spherical gas pores, concentrated in the infill hatched region; this was attributed to the lower energy density and less focused beam used in the infill strategy allowing less opportunity for gas bubbles to escape the melt pool. Overall, increasing the energy density or focus of the beam was found to correlate strongly to a reduction in the level of gas porosity. Rarer irregular shaped pores were mostly located in the contour region and have been attributed to a lack of fusion between powder particles."}{"Towards a digital infrastructure for engineering materials data ": "The industrial and research sectors make significant investments in developing and producing engineering materials. These materials are manufactured and qualified in accordance with a body of product and testing standards that have evolved over many decades to meet ever more demanding requirements. Yet the very significant volume of data that result from these activities remains largely unavailable. While efforts to establish a digital infrastructure for engineering materials data can be traced back more than three decades, widespread adoption of machine-readable formats to enable the routine transfer of engineering materials data has yet to be realized. Given the reliance on electronic systems in all aspects of engineering materials development, manufacture, and qualification, it is an anomaly that simply preserving and transferring engineering materials data remains an issue. This anomaly is accentuated by the fact that in recent years other business domains have benefited from the integration of web technologies into established business models. To address these shortcomings a digital infrastructure is needed that allows and encourages the seamless transfer of engineering materials data between different systems. It is in this context that renewed efforts to develop standard formats for engineering materials data are taking place in the frame of CEN Workshops. While building on prior activities at ASTM and ISO, this work leverages existing product and testing standards with a view to engaging the engineering materials community. With preliminary technical specifications having already been demonstrated to streamline the data transfer process, attention is turning to the long-standing challenge of promoting a culture of data sharing. Whereas previously the motivations for researchers and industrial organizations to share data were lacking, the initial impacts of the DataCite framework for data citation on the utilization of the European Commission materials database hosted at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu are suggestive of a sea-change in data sharing and reuse. This paper describes the status of the work to develop data formats for engineering materials in the frame of CEN Workshops and reports on the added value of data citation beyond simply ensuring that data creators are properly accredited for their work. It also reports the outcome of work to enable the European Commission materials database to support standards compliant data formats and data citation, whereby the barriers to systems integration have been considerably reduced and, irrespective of the level of confidentiality, organizations in both the industrial and research sectors now routinely enable their data sets for citation. Together with recent innovations in digital publishing, a renewed interest in the development of standards for engineering materials data offers new prospects for discovery, exchange, and reuse of engineering materials data. Taken along with other data centric initiatives, such as physics-based and multi-scale modelling, Open Data, and linked data, it can reasonably be argued that standard data formats and data publishing herald a transition towards a digital infrastructure for engineering materials data."}{"Combinatorial electrochemistry \u2013 Processing and characterization for materials discovery ": "Combinatorial materials science is a research methodology for accelerating the pace of materials discovery and optimization. This article reviews issues in combinatorial processing of materials for, and characterization of materials by, electrochemical methods. In particular the emphasis is on the discovery of electrocatalysts for energy uses, including batteries, fuel cells, and related applications. The article also discusses issues in analyzing and using the data obtained from such experiments. Finally, it is emphasized that for most applications it is necessary to confirm results obtained by rapid screening with more traditional approaches on bulk samples in \u201creal world\u201d environments."}{"Automated, high throughput exploration of process\u2013structure\u2013property relationships using the MapReduce paradigm ": "The microstructure of a material intimately affects the performance of a device made from this material. The microstructure, in turn, is affected by the processing pathway used to fabricate the device. This forms the process\u2013structure\u2013property triangle that is central to material science. There has been increasing interest to comprehensively understand and subsequently exploit process\u2013structure\u2013property (PSP) relationships to design processing pathways that result in tailored microstructures exhibiting optimal properties. However, unraveling process\u2013structure\u2013property relationships usually requires systematic and tedious combinatorial search of process and system variables to identify the microstructures that are produced. This is further complicated by the necessity to interrogate the properties of the huge set of corresponding microstructures. Motivated by this challenge, we focus on developing a generic methodology to establish and explore PSP pathways. We leverage recent advances in high performance computing (HPC) and high throughput computing (HTC) with the premise that a domain expert should be able to focus on domain specific PSP problems while the highly specialized HPC/HTC knowledge needed to approach such problems should be hidden from the domain expert. Our hypothesis is that PSP exploration can be naturally formulated in terms of a standard paradigm in cloud computing, namely the MapReduce programming model. We show how reformulating PSP exploration into a MapReduce workflow enables us to take advantage of advances in cloud computing while requiring minimal specialized knowledge of HPC. We illustrate this generic approach by exploring PSP relationships relevant to organic photovoltaics. We focus on identifying microstructural traits that correlate with specific properties of the photovoltaic process: exciton generation, exciton dissociation and charge generation. We integrate a graph-based microstructure characterization tool, and a microstructure-aware device simulator into the MapReduce workflow to automatically generate, explore and identify highly correlated microstructural traits. Identification of these microstructural traits has significant implications for designing the next generation of organic photovoltaics."}{"Materials and processes for the effective capture and immobilization of radioiodine: A review ": "The immobilization of radioiodine produced from reprocessing used nuclear fuel is a growing priority for research and development of nuclear waste forms. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current issues surrounding processing and containment of 129I, the isotope of greatest concern due to its long half-life of 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u00a0y and potential incorporation into the human body. Strategies for disposal of radioiodine, captured by both wet scrubbing and solid sorbents, are discussed, as well as potential iodine waste streams for insertion into an immobilization process. Next, consideration of direct disposal of salts, incorporation into glasses, ceramics, cements, and other phases is discussed. The bulk of the review is devoted to an assessment of various sorbents for iodine and of waste forms described in the literature, particularly inorganic minerals, ceramics, and glasses. This review also contains recommendations for future research needed to address radioiodine immobilization materials and processes."}{"Intragranular cellular segregation network structure strengthening 316L stainless steel prepared by selective laser melting ": "A feasibility study was performed to fabricate ITER In-Vessel components by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) supported by Fusion for Energy (F4E). Almost fully dense 316L stainless steel (SS316L) components were prepared from gas-atomized powder and with optimized SLM processing parameters. Tensile tests and Charpy-V tests were carried out at 22\u00a0\u00b0C and 250\u00a0\u00b0C and the results showed that SLM SS316L fulfill the RCC-MR code. Microstructure characterization reveals the presence of hierarchical macro-, micro- and nano-structures in as-built samples that were very different from SS316L microstructures prepared by other established methods. The formation of a characteristic intragranular cellular segregation network microstructure appears to contribute to the increase of yield strength without losing ductility. Silicon oxide nano-inclusions were formed during the SLM process that generated a micro-hardness fluctuation in the building direction. The combined influence of a cellular microstructure and the nano-inclusions constraints the size of ductile dimples to nano-scale. The crack propagation is hindered by a pinning effect that improves the defect-tolerance of the SLM SS316L. This work proves that it was possible to manufacture SS316L with properties suitable for ITER First Wall panels. Further studies on irradiation properties of SLM SS316L and manufacturing of larger real-size components are needed."}{"Enhancement of barrier and corrosion protection performance of an epoxy coating through wet transfer of amino functionalized graphene oxide ": "An amino functionalized graphene oxide (FGO) was synthesized and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Then, FGO/epoxy composite was prepared through dispersing 0.1wt.% of FGO in an epoxy coating through wet transfer method (WTM). The GO/epoxy and FGO/epoxy composites were applied on the mild steel substrates and their barrier and corrosion protection performance were characterized by salt spray test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Incorporation of 0.1wt.% of FGO nanosheets into the epoxy coating significantly enhanced the corrosion resistance of the coating through improving its ionic resistance as well as barrier properties."}{"Theoretical insights into the hydrogen evolution activity of layered transition metal dichalcogenides ": "A thermodynamic descriptor-based approach using density functional theory calculations was used to investigate the activity and stability of 26 different transition metal dichalcogenide catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We considered variations in the transition metal (Ti, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Pd, Pt), the chalcogen (S and Se), the crystal structure (1T and 2H), and the surface termination (basal plane or edge). We find that the HER activity is strongly related to the stability of the catalyst, setting practical limitations on their potential application in HER. For the basal planes, the metallicity is found to be the most important parameter in determining the activity rather than structure or composition. However, systematic improvements in activity are strongly limited by a decrease in stability. For the edges, the activity and stability relationship are similar regardless of structure or chalcogen, and it is possible to achieve optimal hydrogen binding with a stable surface. Nudged elastic band calculations were carried out to probe the possible mechanisms for HER; the insurmountably high barrier for the Tafel mechanism suggests that HER may occur solely via the Volmer\u2013Heyrovsky route for these materials."}{"A benchmark database for adsorption bond energies to transition metal surfaces and comparison to selected DFT functionals ": "We present a literature collection of experimental adsorption energies over late transition metal surfaces for systems where we believe the energy measurements are particularly accurate, and the atomic-scale adsorption geometries are particularly well established. We propose that this could become useful for benchmarking theoretical methods for calculating adsorption processes. We compare the experimental results to six commonly used electron density functionals, including some (RPBE, BEEF-vdW) which were specifically developed to treat adsorption processes. The comparison shows that there is ample room for improvements in the theoretical descriptions."}{"Hydrazine network on Cu(111) surface: A Density Functional Theory approach ": "We have used first-principles calculations, including a correction for the dispersive forces (DFT-D2), to investigate the arrangement of hydrazine (N2H4) molecules upon adsorption on the Cu(111) surface, showing that surface\u2013molecule interactions affect the process most. Our calculations provide insight into the interplay between lateral adsorbate\u2013adsorbate and vertical adsorbate\u2013substrate interactions. We found that the main contributors to the assembly of the hydrazine layers are the binding interactions between the adsorbates and the substrate. The dispersion forces are predominant in both vertical and lateral interactions, whereas hydrogen-bonding is least important and organisation of the N2H4 monolayers is therefore primarily due to the long-range interactions. Optimised geometries for several hydrazine conformations were found to be coverage-dependent. The electronic properties such as charge density and density of states have been calculated for different hydrazine coverages, and indicated that no charge transfer occurs between molecules. Scanning tunnelling microscopy images were simulated, where the observed protrusions arise from the trans conformers. We also found that the effect of hydrazine adsorption on the Cu(111) surface energy is negligible and further investigation of other Cu facets is needed to determine the N2H4 effect on the nanoparticles' morphology. Finally, we have simulated the temperature programmed desorption of different coverages of hydrazine from the Cu(111) resulting in desorption peaks between 150 and 200K."}{"Ferroelectrics: A pathway to switchable surface chemistry and catalysis ": "It has been known for more than six decades that ferroelectricity can affect a material's surface physics and chemistry thereby potentially enhancing its catalytic properties. Ferroelectrics are a class of materials with a switchable electrical polarization that can affect surface stoichiometry and electronic structure and thus adsorption energies and modes; e.g., molecular versus dissociative. Therefore, ferroelectrics may be utilized to achieve switchable surface chemistry whereby surface properties are not fixed but can be dynamically controlled by, for example, applying an external electric field or modulating the temperature. Several important examples of applications of ferroelectric and polar materials in photocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis are discussed. In photocatalysis, the polarization direction can control band bending at water/ferroelectric and ferroelectric/semiconductor interfaces, thereby facilitating charge separation and transfer to the electrolyte and enhancing photocatalytic activity. For gas\u2013surface interactions, available results suggest that using ferroelectrics to support catalytically active transition metals and oxides is another way to enhance catalytic activity. Finally, the possibility of incorporating ferroelectric switching into the catalytic cycle itself is described. In this scenario, a dynamic collaboration of two polarization states can be used to drive reactions that have been historically challenging to achieve on surfaces with fixed chemical properties (e.g., direct NOx decomposition and the selective partial oxidation of methane). These predictions show that dynamic modulation of the polarization can help overcome some of the fundamental limitations on catalytic activity imposed by the Sabatier principle."}{"The impact of economic, political and social globalization on overweight and obesity in the 56 low and middle income countries ": "Anecdotal and descriptive evidence has led to the claim that globalization plays a major role in inducing overweight and obesity in developing countries, but robust quantitative evidence is scarce. We undertook extensive econometric analyses of several datasets, using a series of new proxies for different dimensions of globalization potentially affecting overweight in up to 887,000 women aged 15\u201349 living in 56 countries between 1991 and 2009. After controlling for relevant individual and country level factors, globalization as a whole is substantially and significantly associated with an increase in the individual propensity to be overweight among women. Surprisingly, political and social globalization dominate the influence of the economic dimension. Hence, more consideration needs to be given to the forms of governance required to shape a more health-oriented globalization process."}{"Ready to give up on life: The lived experience of elderly people who feel life is completed and no longer worth living ": "In the Netherlands, there has been much debate on the question whether elderly people over 70 who are tired of life and who consider their life to be completed, should have legal options to ask for assisted dying. So far there has been little research into the experiences of these elderly people. In order to develop deliberate policy and care that targets this group of elderly people, it is necessary to understand their lifeworld. The aim of this paper is to describe the phenomenon \u2018life is completed and no longer worth living\u2019 from a lifeworld perspective, as it is lived and experienced by elderly people. Between April to December 2013, we conducted 25 in-depth interviews. A reflective lifeworld research design, drawing on the phenomenological tradition, was used during the data gathering and data analysis. The essential meaning of the phenomenon is understood as \u2018a tangle of inability and unwillingness to connect to one's actual life\u2019, characterized by a permanently lived tension: daily experiences seem incompatible with people's expectations of life and their idea of whom they are. While feeling more and more disconnected to life, a yearning desire to end life is strengthened. The experience is further explicated in its five constituents: 1) a sense of aching loneliness; 2) the pain of not mattering; 3) the inability to express oneself; 4) multidimensional tiredness; and 5) a sense of aversion towards feared dependence. This article provides evocative and empathic lifeworld descriptions contributing to a deeper understanding of these elderly people and raises questions about a close association between death wishes and depression in this sample."}{"Transgender stigma and health: A critical review of stigma determinants, mechanisms, and interventions ": "Rationale\n                  Transgender people in the United States experience widespread prejudice, discrimination, violence, and other forms of stigma.\n               \n               \n                  Objective\n                  This critical review aims to integrate the literature on stigma towards transgender people in the US.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  This review demonstrates that transgender stigma limits opportunities and access to resources in a number of critical domains (e.g., employment, healthcare), persistently affecting the physical and mental health of transgender people. The applied social ecological model employed here elucidates that transgender stigma operates at multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, structural) to impact health. Stigma prevention and coping interventions hold promise for reducing stigma and its adverse health-related effects in transgender populations.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Additional research is needed to document the causal relationship between stigma and adverse health as well as the mediators and moderators of stigma in US transgender populations. Multi-level interventions to prevent stigma towards transgender people are warranted."}{"Properties and applications of halloysite nanotubes: recent research advances and future prospects ": "Halloysite is a natural nanosized tubular clay mineral that has many potentially important uses in different industrial fields. In this paper, the key structural characteristics and properties of halloysite and their related applications are comprehensively reviewed. Research advances on halloysite, especially those from the past 20years, are summarized with some critical comments. Attention is mainly paid to the structure and morphology of halloysite and their changes, the formation of tubular structures, the physicochemical properties, the surface chemical modifications, and the halloysite-based advanced materials and some related applications. Additionally, future prospects and key problems to be solved in halloysite studies are discussed. This review shed new light on both fundamental and applied studies that focused on halloysite."}{"Adsorbents based on montmorillonite for contaminant removal from water: A review ": "Clay minerals and their modified derivatives have composed a large family of adsorbents which can be used for the adsorption of most of the chemical contaminants from aqueous solution. Among this family of adsorbents, those based on montmorillonite (Mt), a typical 2:1 type clay mineral, have been most extensively studied. This article intends to give a general overview of the microstructure, adsorptive characteristics, and environmental applications of the Mt based adsorbents. A comprehensive survey of the numerous literatures shows that Mt based adsorbents have rather complicated structural and adsorptive characteristics. They may have porous or nonporous structure and contain various functional groups; their interlayer structure may be evidently affected by the incorporation of water molecules in aqueous medium. With the complicated structural characteristics, these adsorbents can be used for a wide variety of contaminants, including hydrophobic organic contaminants, cationic/anionic dyes, heavy metal cations, oxyanions, radioactive nuclides, etc. Accordingly, a wide variety of mechanisms are involved for the uptake of these contaminants, such as surface adsorption, partition, ion exchange, surface precipitation, and structural incorporation. Finally, the approaches for proper disposal/reutilization of the spent adsorbents after contaminant adsorption will be briefly discussed. This review on one hand can help the readers in choosing proper and developing novel clay mineral based adsorbents for target contaminants, and on the other hand can give a proper example to systematically show the various mechanisms for the uptake of contaminants on adsorbents."}{"A review on g-C3N4 for photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction ": "Solar fuel generation through water splitting and CO2 photoreduction is an ideal route to provide the renewable energy sources and mitigate global warming. The main challenge in photocatalysis is finding a low-cost photocatalyst that can work efficiently to split water into hydrogen and reduce CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels. Metal-free g-C3N4 photocatalyst shows great potentials for solar fuel production. In this mini review, we summarize the most current advances on novel design idea and new synthesis strategy for g-C3N4 preparation, insightful ideas on extending optical absorption of pristine g-C3N4, overall water splitting and CO2 photoreduction over g-C3N4 based systems. The research challenges and perspectives on g-C3N4 based photocatalysts were also suggested."}{"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of select multi-layered transition metal carbides (MXenes) ": "In this work, a detailed high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is presented for select MXenes\u2014a recently discovered family of two-dimensional (2D) carbides and carbonitrides. Given their 2D nature, understanding their surface chemistry is paramount. Herein we identify and quantify the surface groups present before, and after, sputter-cleaning as well as freshly prepared vs. aged multi-layered cold pressed discs. The nominal compositions of the MXenes studied here are Ti3C2T\n                        x\n                     , Ti2CT\n                        x\n                     , Ti3CNT\n                        x\n                     , Nb2CT\n                        x\n                      and Nb4C3T\n                        x\n                     , where T represents surface groups that this work attempts to quantify. In all the cases, the presence of three surface terminations, O, OH and F, in addition to OH-terminations relatively strongly bonded to H2O molecules, was confirmed. From XPS peak fits, it was possible to establish the average sum of the negative charges of the terminations for the aforementioned MXenes. Based on this work, it is now possible to quantify the nature of the surface terminations. This information can, in turn, be used to better design and tailor these novel 2D materials for various applications."}{"Fingerprint composition and aging: A literature review ": "Fingerprints have a key role in criminal investigations and are the most commonly used form of evidence worldwide. Significant gaps remain however, in the understanding of fingerprint chemistry, including enhancement reaction mechanisms and the effect of environmental variables and time on composition. Determining the age of a fingerprint is also a relatively unexplored area. A successful method, with reliable and quantitative estimates, would have numerous advantages. Previous unreliable methods have predominantly focused on enhancement success based on physical and chemical changes.\n                  This review explores variations in composition due to donor characteristics and environmental variables, and identifies gaps for further research. We also present a qualitative and quantitative summary of the effect of time on composition. Kinetics are presented where known, with summary schematics for reaction mechanisms. Previous studies exploring methods for determining the age of a fingerprint are also discussed, including their advantages and disadvantages. Lastly we propose a potentially more accurate and reliable methodology for determining fingerprint age based on quantitative kinetic changes to the composition of a fingerprint over time."}{"Surface chemistry of porphyrins and phthalocyanines ": "This review covers the surface chemistry of porphyrins, phthalocyanines, their metal complexes, and related compounds, with particular focus on chemical reactions at solid/vacuum interfaces. Porphyrins are not only important biomolecules, they also find, together with the artificial phthalocyanines, numerous technological and scientific applications, which often involve surface and interface related aspects. After a brief summary of fundamental properties of these molecules in the context of surface science, the following topics will be discussed: (1) Aspects of geometric structure, including self-assembly, conformation, mobility and manipulation of the adsorbed molecules. (2) Surface-related changes of the electronic structure and the magnetic properties. (3) The role of the metal center in the surface chemical bond. (4) On-surface coordination reactions, such as direct metalation and coordination of axial ligands. (5) The influence of axial ligands on the surface chemical bond and the magnetic properties."}{"Vibrational and optical properties of MoS2: From monolayer to bulk ": "Molybdenum disulfide, MoS2, has recently gained considerable attention as a layered material where neighboring layers are only weakly interacting and can easily slide against each other. Therefore, mechanical exfoliation allows the fabrication of single and multi-layers and opens the possibility to generate atomically thin crystals with outstanding properties. In contrast to graphene, it has an optical gap of ~1.9eV. This makes it a prominent candidate for transistor and opto-electronic applications. Single-layer MoS2 exhibits remarkably different physical properties compared to bulk MoS2 due to the absence of interlayer hybridization. For instance, while the band gap of bulk and multi-layer MoS2 is indirect, it becomes direct with decreasing number of layers.\n                  In this review, we analyze from a theoretical point of view the electronic, optical, and vibrational properties of single-layer, few-layer and bulk MoS2. In particular, we focus on the effects of spin\u2013orbit interaction, number of layers, and applied tensile strain on the vibrational and optical properties. We examine the results obtained by different methodologies, mainly ab initio approaches. We also discuss which approximations are suitable for MoS2 and layered materials. The effect of external strain on the band gap of single-layer MoS2 and the crossover from indirect to direct band gap is investigated. We analyze the excitonic effects on the absorption spectra. The main features, such as the double peak at the absorption threshold and the high-energy exciton are presented. Furthermore, we report on the the phonon dispersion relations of single-layer, few-layer and bulk MoS2. Based on the latter, we explain the behavior of the Raman-active \n                        \n                           \n                              A\n                           \n                           \n                              1\n                              g\n                           \n                        \n                      and \n                        \n                           \n                              E\n                           \n                           \n                              2\n                              g\n                           \n                           \n                              1\n                           \n                        \n                      modes as a function of the number of layers.

However, this formulation shows some inconsistencies that are not completely understood. In this paper we formulate the problem of the static bending of Euler\u2013Bernoulli beams using the Eringen integral constitutive equation. It is shown that, in general, the Eringen model in differential form is not equivalent to the Eringen model in integral form, and a general method to solve the problem rigorously in integral form is proposed. Beams with different boundary and load conditions are analyzed and the results are compared with those derived from the differential approach showing that they are different in general. With this integral formulation, the paradox that appears when solving the cantilever beam with the differential form of the Eringen model (increase in stiffness with the nonlocal parameter) is solved, which is one of the main contributions of the present work."}{"Aeroelastic energy harvesting: A review ": "Energy harvesting is the process by which light, thermal, solar, and kinetic energy can be converted to a usable form of energy with the ultimate objective of developing self-powered sensors, actuators, and other electronic devices. Each of these sources of energy can be used to power remote sensors, however, many researchers have emphasized on vibration-based energy harvesting. Converting ambient and aeroelastic vibrations can be achieved using either electromagnetic, electrostatic or piezoelectric transduction mechanisms. The piezoelectric option has attracted significant interest because it can be used to harvest energy over a wide range of frequencies and the ease of its application. Many researchers have used the piezoelectric transducer to develop simple and efficient energy harvesting devices from vibrations. In this paper, we review recent literature in the field of energy harvesting from aeroelastic vibrations during the last few years. Various types of aeroelastic vibration mechanisms and representative mathematical models are also reviewed. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between different existing flow-induced vibrations energy harvesters are discussed. Limitations and future recommendations are also presented."}{"Men and mice: Relating their ages ": "Since the late 18th century, the murine model has been widely used in biomedical research (about 59% of total animals used) as it is compact, cost-effective, and easily available, conserving almost 99% of human genes and physiologically resembling humans. Despite the similarities, mice have a diminutive lifespan compared to humans. In this study, we found that one human year is equivalent to nine mice days, although this is not the case when comparing the lifespan of mice versus humans taking the entire life at the same time without considering each phase separately. Therefore, the precise correlation of age at every point in their lifespan must be determined. Determining the age relation between mice and humans is necessary for setting up experimental murine models more analogous in age to humans. Thus, more accuracy can be obtained in the research outcome for humans of a specific age group, although current outcomes are based on mice of an approximate age. To fill this gap between approximation and accuracy, this review article is the first to establish a precise relation between mice age and human age, following our previous article, which explained the relation in ages of laboratory rats with humans in detail."}{"Practical, regulatory and clinical considerations for development of inhalation drug products ": "The formulation and device collectively constitute an inhalation drug product.

When a continuous tangential velocity field exists on the surface of the liquid sample which is homeomorphic to a ball, zero velocity points will be necessarily present at the surface. The theorem is exemplified with the analysis of the instability occurring under the rapid evaporation of polymer solutions. Zero velocity points, accumulating pores, enable direct visualization of the instability. The patterning may be essentially different on the surface of a torus."}{"Theory of Water Desalination by Porous Electrodes with Immobile Chemical Charge ": "In capacitive deionization (CDI), water is desalinated by storing ions in electrical double layers (EDLs) within the micropores of charged porous carbon electrodes. Recent experiments using chemically modified electrodes have shown differing, novel phenomena such as \u201cinverted CDI,\u201d \u201cenhanced CDI,\u201d and \u201cinversion peaks.\u201d We here present an EDL and dynamic model which includes immobile chemical charge in the micropores and show that the models predict these disparate experimental observations.

We measure the charge storage capacity as function of salt concentration, and use Gouy\u2013Chapman\u2013Stern theory to describe the data. CNT yarn can also be used as conductive scaffold for the application of a porous activated carbon (AC) layer. We show the potential of CNT yarn for the generation of electrical energy from environmental entropy differences, by coating yarn (both with and without AC coating) with ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) and generating power from the salt concentration difference between river water and seawater. The use of flexible and conductive CNT yarns as capacitive electrodes and electrode scaffolds breaks with the paradigm of planar static electrodes, and opens up a range of alternative designs for electrochemical cells with enhanced performance."}{"Zero valent Ag deposited TiO2 for the efficient photocatalysis of methylene blue under UV-C light irradiation ": "Zero valent silver nanoparticle deposited TiO2 composite (Ag/TiO2) has been prepared and characterized by SEM, TEM, XPS and FTIR techniques. The photocatalytic property of Ag/TiO2 for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) was investigated under the ultraviolet-C light irradiation. The effect of various operation parameters such as solution pH, irradiation time, initial MB concentration and catalyst dose was also studied. The results indicated that an increase in solution pH boosted the photocatalytic degradation of MB by Ag/TiO2 reaching a maximum at pH9.0. The degradation of MB decreased from 96.66% to 45.76% with the rise in startup MB concentration from 3 to 13mg/L. An enhanced degradation of MB was noticed with the increment in the amount of composite from 0.025g to 0.1g and afterwards an increase in catalyst mass resulted in reduction in the degradation of MB. Moreover, Ni(II) amelioration in MB solution also showed an adverse effect on Ag/TiO2 activity."}{"Solvent strategies for loading and release in mesoporous silica ": "A model molecule, ibuprofen, was loaded in the pores of mesoporous silica by adsorption from nonpolar solvents (liquid carbon dioxide and cyclohexane) and from a polar solvent (methanol). It was sufficient with a very low concentration of ibuprofen in the nonpolar solvents to achieve maximum loading of ibuprofen in the mesoporous particles. When using liquid carbon dioxide, the pores of the mesoporous silica particles were filled completely with ibuprofen at a lower ibuprofen concentration than similar experiments performed with cyclohexane. When methanol was used, the maximum amount of loaded ibuprofen was never achieved. Furthermore, x-ray scattering showed that all ibuprofen loaded into the mesoporous particles were in an amorphous state. Ibuprofen was released from the mesoporous particles to water within a couple of minutes, regardless of solvent used for loading. It was found that the release of ibuprofen from mesoporous silica was much faster than that of crystalline ibuprofen."}{"Synthesis and characterization of magneto-rheological (MR) fluids for MR brake application ": "Magneto rheological (MR) fluid technology has been proven for many industrial applications like shock absorbers, actuators, etc. MR fluid is a smart material whose rheological characteristics change rapidly and can be controlled easily in presence of an applied magnetic field. MR brake is a device to transmit torque by the shear stress of MR fluid. However, MR fluids exhibit yield stress of 50\u201390\u00a0kPa. In this research, an effort has been made to synthesize MR fluid sample/s which will typically meet the requirements of MR brake applications. In this study, various electrolytic and carbonyl iron powder based MR fluids have been synthesized by mixing grease as a stabilizer, oleic acid as an antifriction additive and gaur gum powder as a surface coating to reduce agglomeration of the MR fluid. MR fluid samples based on sunflower oil, which is bio-degradable, environmentally friendly and abundantly available have also been synthesized. These MR fluid samples are characterized for determination of magnetic, morphological and rheological properties. This study helps identify most suitable localized MR fluid meant for MR brake application."}{"State of the art on tribological behavior of polymer matrix composites reinforced with natural fibers in the green materials world ": "Natural fiber reinforced polymer composites have emerged as a potential environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternative to synthetic fiber reinforced composites. Therefore, in the past decade, a number of major industries, such as the automotive, construction and packaging industries, have shown a considerable interest in the progress of new natural fiber reinforced composite materials. The availability of natural fibers and the ease of manufacturing have tempted researchers to study their feasibility of their application as reinforcement and the extent to which they satisfy the required specifications in tribological applications. However, less information concerning the tribological performance of natural fiber reinforced composite material is available in the literature. Hence, the aim of this bibliographic review is to demonstrate the tribological behavior of natural fiber reinforced composites and find a knowledge about their usability for various applications that tribology plays a dominant role. This review presents the reported work on natural fiber reinforced composites with special reference to the type of fibers, matrix polymers, treatment of fibers and test parameters. The results show that composites reinforced with natural fibers have an improvement in tribological properties and their properties are comparable with conventional fibers. In addition, fiber treatment and fiber orientation are two important factors can affect tribological properties where treated fibers and normal oriented fibers exhibit better friction and wear behavior. This review is trying to evaluate the effect of test parameter including normal load and sliding speed on tribological properties, and the results vary based on type of reinforcement. Generally, due to their positive economic and environmental aspects, as well as their good tribological properties, natural composites are showing a good potential for employing in several applications."}{"Effects of oxygen enriched combustion on pollution and performance characteristics of a diesel engine ": "Oxygen enriched combustion is one of the attractive combustion technologies to control pollution and improve combustion in diesel engines. An experimental test was conducted on a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine to study the impact of oxygen enrichment on pollution and performance parameters by increasing the oxygen concentration of intake air from 21 to 27% by volume. The tests results show that the combustion process was improved as there is an increase in thermal efficiency of 4 to 8 percent and decrease in brake specific fuel consumption of 5 to 12 percent. There is also a substantial decrease in unburned hydro carbon, carbon mono-oxide and smoke density levels to the maximum of 40, 55 and 60 percent respectively. However, there is a considerable increase in nitrogen oxide emissions due to increased combustion temperature and extra oxygen available which needs to be addressed."}{"A review of unconventional sustainable building insulation materials ": "Building insulation is commonly realized using materials obtained from petrochemicals (mainly polystyrene) or from natural sources processed with high energy consumptions (glass and rock wools). These materials cause significant detrimental effects on the environment mainly due to the production stage, i.e. use of non-renewable materials and fossil energy consumption, and to the disposal stage, i.e. problems in reusing or recycling the products at the end of their lives. The introduction of the concept of \u201csustainability\u201d in building design process encouraged researches aimed at developing thermal and acoustic insulating materials using natural or recycled materials. Some of them, such as kenaf or wood fiber, are already commercialized but their diffusion could be further improved since their performance is similar to the synthetic ones. Others are currently under study and their development is only at an early stage. The goal of the paper is to report a state of the art of building insulation products made of natural or recycled materials that are not or scarcely commercialized. Comparative analyses were carried out considering in particular thermal characteristics in terms of thermal conductivity, specific heat and density. Data on the acoustic performance of the materials were also reported. Life Cycle Assessment data were finally collected, in order to put in evidence the environmental advantages of these materials. Particular attention was paid to researches focused to exploit local materials and even industrial byproducts, since these approaches respectively limit transportation and disposal impacts."}{"Electric vehicle traction motors without rare earth magnets ": "Since the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) became main-stream with the launch of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the use of rare earth magnets in vehicle traction motors has become common. In particular the rare earth based, hard magnetic material Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) has offered significant performance benefits, not possible with other technologies, enabling the development of compact, torque- and power-dense electric traction motors. This trend has continued as mass market Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) such as the Nissan Leaf, have come to market. However in 2011\u20132012 the price of these materials rose significantly, owing to geopolitical concerns relating to security of supply. Whilst the price has recovered more recently closer to historical levels, concern still remains in the minds of governments and many manufacturers of hybrid and electric vehicles. Reports have also raised questions over the environmental sustainability of these materials and this has further encouraged users to consider alternatives. This paper therefore examines why these magnetic materials have been so successful in traction motor applications. It also explores the alternatives, including those which are ready for market and those which are in the process of being developed."}{"Effect of mill type on the size reduction and phase transformation of gamma alumina ": "The influence of stress modes and comminution conditions on the effectiveness of particle size reduction of a common catalyst support; \u03b3-Alumina is examined through a comparative assessment of three different mill types. Air jet milling is found to be the most effective in reducing particle size from a d\n                     90 of 37\u00b5m to 2.9\u00b5m compared to planetary ball milling (30.2\u00b5m) and single ball milling (10.5\u00b5m). XRD and TEM studies confirm that the planetary ball mill causes phase transformation to the less desired \u03b1-Alumina resulting in a notable decrease in surface area from 136.6m2/g to 82.5m2/g as measured by the BET method. This is consistent with the large shear stresses under high shear rates prevailing in the planetary ball mill when compared to the other mill types. These observations are consistent with a shear-induced phase transformation mechanism brought about by slip on alternate close packed oxygen layers from a cubic close packed to a hexagonal close packed structure."}{"Airlift bioreactor for biological applications with microbubble mediated transport processes ": "Airlift bioreactors can provide an attractive alternative to stirred tanks, particularly for bioprocesses with gaseous reactants or products. Frequently, however, they are susceptible to being limited by gas\u2013liquid mass transfer and by poor mixing of the liquid phase, particularly when they are operating at high cell densities. In this work we use CFD modelling to show that microbubbles generated by fluidic oscillation can provide an effective, low energy means of achieving high interfacial area for mass transfer and improved liquid circulation for mixing.\n                  The results show that when the diameter of the microbubbles exceeded 200\u00b5m, the \u201cdowncomer\u201d region, which is equivalent to about 60% of overall volume of the reactor, is free from gas bubbles. The results also demonstrate that the use of microbubbles not only increases surface area to volume ratio, but also increases mixing efficiency through increasing the liquid velocity circulation around the draft tube. In addition, the depth of downward penetration of the microbubbles into the downcomer increases with decreasing bubbles size due to a greater downward drag force compared to the buoyancy force. The simulated results indicate that the volume of dead zone increases as the height of diffuser location is increased. We therefore hypothesise that poor gas bubble distribution due to the improper location of the diffuser may have a markedly deleterious effect on the performance of the bioreactor used in this work."}{"Double emulsion production in glass capillary microfluidic device: Parametric investigation of droplet generation behaviour ": "A three-phase axisymmetric numerical model based on Volume of Fluid\u2013Continuum Surface Force (VOF\u2013CSF) model was developed to perform parametric analysis of compound droplet production in three-phase glass capillary devices that combine co-flow and countercurrent flow focusing. The model predicted successfully generation of core\u2013shell and multi-cored double emulsion droplets in dripping and jetting (narrowing and widening) regime and was used to investigate the effects of phase flow rates, fluid properties, and geometry on the size, morphology, and production rate of droplets. As the outer fluid flow rate increased, the size of compound droplets was reduced until a dripping-to-jetting transition occurred. By increasing the middle fluid flow rate, the size of compound droplets increased, which led to a widening jetting regime. The jetting was supressed by increasing the orifice size in the collection capillary or increasing the interfacial tension at the outer interface up to 0.06N/m. The experimental and simulation results can be used to encapsulate CO2 solvents within gas-permeable microcapsules."}{"A cost roadmap for silicon heterojunction solar cells ": "Research and development of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells has seen a marked increase since the recent expiry of core patents describing SHJ technology. SHJ solar cells are expected to offer various cost benefits compared to conventional crystalline silicon solar cells. This paper analyses the production costs associated with five different SHJ cell designs, including an interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) design. Using life-cycle costing, we analyzed the current cost breakdown of these SHJ designs, and compared them to conventional diffused junction monocrystalline silicon modules. Coupling the results for current designs with literature data on technological improvements, we also present a prospective analysis of production costs for the five SHJ cells and modules.\n                  For current designs, module costs were calculated to be 0.48\u20130.56 USD per Watt-peak (\n                        \n                           \n                              W\n                           \n                           \n                              p\n                           \n                        \n                     ) for SHJ modules, compared to 0.50USD/\n                        \n                           \n                              W\n                           \n                           \n                              p\n                           \n                        \n                      for a conventional c-Si module. The efficiency bonus for SHJ modules compared to conventional c-Si modules is offset by a strong increase in metallization costs for SHJ designs, as comparatively large amounts of low-temperature silver-paste are required. For module materials, the requirement for conductive adhesives results in a small cost penalty for SHJ modules compared to c-Si modules, which is more than balanced by the effect of higher efficiency in SHJ modules.\n                  Our prospective study showed that improvements in cell processing and module design could result in a significant drop in production costs for all module types studied. The SHJ modules gain much advantage by reducing and replacing silver consumption, increased cell efficiency and thinner wafers and have prospective production costs of 0.29\u20130.35\n                     \n                        USD\n                        /\n                        \n                           \n                              W\n                           \n                           \n                              p\n                           \n                        \n                     . Conventional c-Si module cost is less sensitive to silver paste consumption, limiting the potential for cost reduction, and has prospective production costs of 0.33\n                     \n                        USD\n                        /\n                        \n                           \n                              W\n                           \n                           \n                              p\n                           \n                        \n                     .

This technology is particularly promising, as it is compatible with cheap solution processing. For a thin-film solar product to be commercially viable, it must pass the IEC 61646 testing standards, regarding the environmental stability. Currently, the poor stability of perovskite solar cells is a barrier to commercialisation. The main issue causing this problem is the instability of the perovskite layer when in contact with moisture; however, it is important to explore stability problems with the other layers and interfaces within the device. The stability issues discussed in this review highlight the need to view the device as a whole system, due to the interdependent relationships between the layers, including: the perovskite absorber, electron transport layers, hole transport layers, other buffer layers and the electrodes. We also discuss other issues pertaining to device stability, such as measurement-induced hysteresis and the requirement for standard testing protocols. For perovskite solar cells to achieve the required stability, future research must focus on improving the intrinsic stability of the perovskite absorber layer, carefully designing the device geometry, and finding durable encapsulant materials, which seal the device from moisture."}{"Measurement and assessment of water resources carrying capacity in Henan Province, China ": "As demands on limited water resources intensify, concerns are being raised about water resources carrying capacity (WRCC), which is defined as the maximum sustainable socioeconomic scale that can be supported by available water resources and while maintaining defined environmental conditions. This paper proposes a distributed quantitative model for WRCC, based on the principles of optimization, and considering hydro-economic interaction, water supply, water quality, and socioeconomic development constraints. With the model, the WRCCs of 60 subregions in Henan Province were determined for different development periods. The results showed that the water resources carrying level of Henan Province was suitably loaded in 2010, but that the province would be mildly overloaded in 2030 with respect to the socioeconomic development planning goals. The restricting factors for WRCC included the available water resources, the increasing rate of GDP, the urbanization ratio, the irrigation water utilization coefficient, the industrial water recycling rate, and the wastewater reuse rate, of which the available water resources was the most crucial factor. Because these factors varied temporally and spatially, the trends in predicted WRCC were inconsistent across different subregions and periods."}{"Adapting Hidden Markov Models for Online Learning ": "In modern computer systems, the intermittent behaviour of infrequent, additional loads affects performance. Often, representative traces of storage disks or remote servers can be scarce and obtaining real data is sometimes expensive. Therefore, stochastic models, through simulation and profiling, provide cheaper, effective solutions, where input model parameters are obtained. A typical example is the Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP), which can have its time index discretised to form a hidden Markov model (HMM). These models have been successful in capturing bursty behaviour and cyclic patterns of I/O operations and Internet traffic, using underlying properties of the discrete (or continuous) Markov chain. However, learning on such models can be cumbersome in terms of complexity through re-training on data sets. Thus, we provide an online learning HMM (OnlineHMM), which is composed of two existing variations of HMMs: first, a sliding HMM using a moving average technique to update its parameters \u201con-the-fly\u201d and, secondly, a multi-input HMM capable of training on multiple discrete traces simultaneously. The OnlineHMM reduces data processing times significantly and thence synthetic workloads become computationally more cost effective. We measure the accuracy of reproducing representative traces through comparisons of moments and autocorrelation on original data points and HMM-generated synthetic traces. We present, analytically, the training steps saved through the OnlineHMM's adapted Baum-Welch algorithm and obtain, through simulation, mean waiting times of a queueing model. Finally, we conclude our work and offer model extensions for the future."}{"An Introduction to Algebraic Effects and Handlers. Invited tutorial paper ": "This paper is a tutorial on algebraic effects and handlers.
