{"Abaqus implementation of phase-field model for brittle fracture ": "A phase-field model for brittle fracture is implemented in the commercial finite element software Abaqus by means of UEL and UMAT subroutines. The phase-field method considerably reduces the implementation complexity for fracture problems as it removes the need for numerical tracking of discontinuities in the displacement field that are characteristic of discrete crack methods. This is accomplished by replacing the sharp discontinuities with a scalar damage phase-field representing the diffuse crack topology wherein the amount of diffusion is controlled by a regularization parameter. The nonlinear coupled system consisting of the linear momentum equation and a diffusion-type equation governing the phase-field evolution is solved simultaneously via a Newton\u2013Raphson approach. The implemented crack propagation model does not require predefined paths for crack growth or user-defined surfaces to simulate crack debonding. Post-processing of simulation results is performed via an additional subroutine implemented in the visualization module."}{"A review of numerical analysis of friction stir welding ": "Friction stir welding is a relatively new solid-state joining technique which is widely adopted in different industry fields to join different metallic alloys that are hard to weld by conventional fusion welding. Friction stir welding is a highly complex process comprising several highly coupled physical phenomena. The complex geometry of some kinds of joints and their three dimensional nature make it difficult to develop an overall system of governing equations for theoretical analyzing the behavior of the friction stir welded joints. The experiments are often time consuming and costly. To overcome these problems, numerical analysis has frequently been used since the 2000s. This paper reviews the latest developments in the numerical analysis of friction stir welding processes, microstructures of friction stir welded joints and the properties of friction stir welded structures. Some important numerical issues such as materials flow modeling, meshing procedure and failure criteria are discussed. Numerical analysis of friction stir welding will allow many different welding processes to be simulated in order to understand the effects of changes in different system parameters before physical testing, which would be time-consuming or prohibitively expensive in practice. The main methods used in numerical analysis of friction stir welding are discussed and illustrated with brief case studies. In addition, several important key problems and issues remain to be addressed about the numerical analysis of friction stir welding and opportunities for further research are identified."}{"Phase change materials for thermal energy storage ": "Phase change materials (PCMs) used for the storage of thermal energy as sensible and latent heat are an important class of modern materials which substantially contribute to the efficient use and conservation of waste heat and solar energy. The storage of latent heat provides a greater density of energy storage with a smaller temperature difference between storing and releasing heat than the sensible heat storage method. Many different groups of materials have been investigated during the technical evolution of PCMs, including inorganic systems (salt and salt hydrates), organic compounds such as paraffins or fatty acids and polymeric materials, e.g. poly(ethylene glycol). Historically, the relationships between the structure and the energy storage properties of a material have been studied to provide an understanding of the heat accumulation/emission mechanism governing the material\u2019s imparted energy storage characteristics.\n                  This paper reviews the present state of the art of PCMs for thermal energy storage applications and provides an insight into recent efforts to develop new PCMs with enhanced performance and safety. Specific attention is given to the improvement of thermal conductivity, encapsulation methods and shape stabilization procedures. In addition, the flame retarding properties and performance are discussed. The wide range of PCM applications in the construction, electronic, biomedical, textile and automotive industries is presented and future research directions are indicated."}{"Microstructure Characteristics of Inconel 625 Superalloy Manufactured by Selective Laser Melting ": "Selective laser melting (SLM), an additive manufacturing process, is capable of manufacturing metallic parts with complex shapes directly from computer-aided design (CAD) models. SLM parts are created on a layer-by-layer manner, making it more flexible than traditional material processing techniques. In this paper, Inconel 625 alloy, a widely used material in the aerospace industry, were chosen as the build material. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis techniques were employed to analyze its microstructure. It was observed that the molten pool was composed of elongated columnar crystal. Due to the rapid cooling speed, the primary dendrite arm space was approximately 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm and the hardness of SLM state was very high (343 HV). The inverse pole figure (IPF) indicated that the growing orientation of the most grains was <001> due to the epitaxial growth and heat conduction. The XRD results revealed that the austenite structure with large lattice distortion was fully formed. No carbides or precipitated phases were found. After heat treatment the grains grew into two microstructures with distinct morphological characters, namely, rectangular grains and limited in the molten pool, and equiaxed grains along the molten boundaries. Upon experiencing the heat treatment, MC carbides with triangular shapes gradually precipitated. The results also identified that a large number of zigzag grain boundaries were formed. In this study, the grain formation and microstructure, and the laws of the molten pool evolution were also analyzed and discussed."}{"Defects in Graphene: Generation, Healing, and Their Effects on the Properties of Graphene: A Review ": "Graphene has attracted immense investigation since its discovery. Lattice imperfections are introduced into graphene unavoidably during graphene growth or processing. These structural defects are known to significantly affect electronic and chemical properties of graphene. A comprehensive understanding of graphene defect is thus of critical importance. Here we review the major progresses made in defect-related engineering of graphene. Firstly, we give a brief introduction on the types of defects in graphene. Secondly, the generation and healing of the graphene defects are summarized. Then, the effects of defects on the chemical, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of graphene are discussed. Finally, we address the associated challenges and prospects on the future study of defects in graphene and other nanocarbon materials."}{"Fundamental degradation mechanisms of layered oxide Li-ion battery cathode materials: Methodology, insights and novel approaches ": "This overview addresses the atomistic aspects of degradation of layered LiMO2 (M=Ni, Co, Mn) oxide Li-ion battery cathode materials, aiming to shed light on the fundamental degradation mechanisms especially inside active cathode materials and at their interfaces. It includes recent results obtained by novel in situ/in operando diffraction methods, modelling, and quasi in situ surface science analysis. Degradation of the active cathode material occurs upon overcharge, resulting from a positive potential shift of the anode. Oxygen loss and eventual phase transformation resulting in dead regions are ascribed to changes in electronic structure and defect formation. The anode potential shift results from loss of free lithium due to side reactions occurring at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Such side reactions are caused by electron transfer, and depend on the electron energy level alignment at the interface. Side reactions at electrode/electrolyte interfaces and capacity fade may be overcome by the use of suitable solid-state electrolytes and Li-containing anodes."}{"Mechanisms of aging and fatigue in ferroelectrics ": "A comprehensive review of aging and fatigue phenomena in bulk polycrystalline ferroelectrics is presented. Three material classes are covered, namely the most widely used Pb[Zr1\u2212x\n                     Ti\n                        x\n                     ]O3 (PZT) ceramics and lead-free materials, including those based on bismuth sodium titanate Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3 (BNT) and alkali niobate [K\n                        x\n                     Na1\u2212x\n                     ]NbO3 (KNN). Aging is studied in poled and unpoled states both experimentally and theoretically. The variety of different loading regimes for fatigue includes DC electric field, unipolar, sesquipolar and bipolar cycling and all these differently combined with mechanical loading at different frequencies and temperatures. The role of device geometries and electrode materials is addressed and models describing charge migration and defect dipole re-orientation are discussed in the context of recent experimental studies."}{"Synthesis and thermal stability of two-dimensional carbide MXene Ti3C2\n             ": "We investigated the synthesis of quasi-two-dimensional carbide (Ti3C2), with the name of MXene, by immersing Ti3AlC2 in 40% or 49% hydrofluoric acid (HF) at 0\u00b0C, 15\u00b0C or 60\u00b0C. The influences of time, temperature, and source of Ti3AlC2 on the synthesis were researched. It was found that Ti3C2 synthesized from pressureless synthesized Ti3AlC2 was highly oriented compared to that from hot-pressed Ti3AlC2. As-synthesized Ti3C2 could be further exfoliated by intercalation with urea, dimethylsulfoxide or ammonia. From the results of thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, Ti3C2 MXene with F/OH termination was found to be stable in argon atmosphere at temperature up to 800\u00b0C. In oxygen atmosphere, at 200\u00b0C, parts of MXene layers were oxidized to obtain an interesting structure: anatase nano-crystals were evenly distributed on 2D Ti3C2 layers. At 1000\u00b0C, MXene layers were completely oxidized and anatase phase fully transformed to rutile in oxygen atmosphere."}{"Effect of the build orientation on the mechanical properties and fracture modes of SLM Ti\u20136Al\u20134V ": "Recent research on the additive manufacturing (AM) of Ti alloys has shown that the mechanical properties of the parts are affected by the characteristic microstructure that originates from the AM process. To understand the effect of the microstructure on the tensile properties, selective laser melted (SLM) Ti\u20136Al\u20134V samples built in three different orientations were tensile tested. The investigated samples were near fully dense, in two distinct conditions, as-built and stress relieved. It was found that the build orientation affects the tensile properties, and in particular the ductility of the samples. The mechanical anisotropy of the parts was discussed in relation to the crystallographic texture, phase composition and the predominant fracture mechanisms. Fractography and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results indicate that the predominant fracture mechanism is intergranular fracture present along the grain boundaries and thus provide and explain the typical fracture surface features observed in fracture AM Ti\u20136Al\u20134V."}{"Antimicrobial activity of the metals and metal oxide nanoparticles ": "The ever increasing resistance of pathogens towards antibiotics has caused serious health problems in the recent years. It has been shown that by combining modern technologies such as nanotechnology and material science with intrinsic antimicrobial activity of the metals, novel applications for these substances could be identified. According to the reports, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles represent a group of materials which were investigated in respect to their antimicrobial effects. In the present review, we focused on the recent research works concerning antimicrobial activity of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles together with their mechanism of action. Reviewed literature indicated that the particle size was the essential parameter which determined the antimicrobial effectiveness of the metal nanoparticles. Combination therapy with the metal nanoparticles might be one of the possible strategies to overcome the current bacterial resistance to the antibacterial agents. However, further studies should be performed to minimize the toxicity of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles to apply as proper alternatives for antibiotics and disinfectants especially in biomedical applications."}{"Metallic implant biomaterials ": "Human tissue is structured mainly of self-assembled polymers (proteins) and ceramics (bone minerals), with metals present as trace elements with molecular scale functions. However, metals and their alloys have played a predominant role as structural biomaterials in reconstructive surgery, especially orthopedics, with more recent uses in non-osseous tissues, such as blood vessels. With the successful routine use of a large variety of metal implants clinically, issues associated with long-term maintenance of implant integrity have also emerged. This review focuses on metallic implant biomaterials, identifying and discussing critical issues in their clinical applications, including the systemic toxicity of released metal ions due to corrosion, fatigue failure of structural components due to repeated loading, and wearing of joint replacements due to movement. This is followed by detailed reviews on specific metallic biomaterials made from stainless steels, alloys of cobalt, titanium and magnesium, as well as shape memory alloys of nickel\u2013titanium, silver, tantalum and zirconium. For each, the properties that affect biocompatibility and mechanical integrity (especially corrosion fatigue) are discussed in detail. Finally, the most critical challenges for metallic implant biomaterials are summarized, with emphasis on the most promising approaches and strategies."}{"Biodegradable metals ": "After decades of developing strategies to minimize the corrosion of metallic biomaterials, there is now an increasing interest to use corrodible metals in a number of medical device applications. The term \u201cbiodegradable metal\u201d (BM) has been used worldwide to describe these new kinds of degradable metallic biomaterials for medical applications and there were many new findings reported over the last decade. In this paper, the definition of BM and its classification are given for the first time, along with the summary of the degradation mechanisms of BMs and its environmental influencing factors, which includes the degeneration of mechanical integrity and the metabolism of the degradation products. The recently-developed representative Mg-based BMs (pure Mg, Mg\u2013Ca alloy, Mg\u2013Zn alloy, etc.), Fe-based BMs (pure Fe, Fe\u2013Mn-based alloys, etc.) and other BMs (pure W, pure Zn and its alloys, Ca-based and Sr-based bulk metallic glasses, etc.) were comprehensively reviewed with emphases on their microstructures, mechanical properties and degradation behaviors, in vitro and in vivo performances, pre-clinical and clinical trials. Moreover, current approaches to control their biodegradation rates to match the healing rates of the host tissues with various surface modification techniques and novel structural designs are summarized. Finally, this paper comprehensively discusses the directions of future development and the challenges of transitioning BMs from raw materials to semi-products to final medical devices. All in all, BM belongs to \u201cbioactive\u201d biomaterials and its future research and development direction should lean towards \u201cthird-generation biomedical materials\u201d with \u201cmultifunctional capabilities\u201d in a controllable manner to benefit the local tissue reconstruction."}{"Recent progress in resistive random access memories: Materials, switching mechanisms, and performance ": "This review article attempts to provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in the so-called resistive random access memories (RRAMs). First, a brief introduction is presented to describe the construction and development of RRAMs, their potential for broad applications in the fields of nonvolatile memory, unconventional computing and logic devices, and the focus of research concerning RRAMs over the past decade. Second, both inorganic and organic materials used in RRAMs are summarized, and their respective advantages and shortcomings are discussed. Third, the important switching mechanisms are discussed in depth and are classified into ion migration, charge trapping/de-trapping, thermochemical reaction, exclusive mechanisms in inorganics, and exclusive mechanisms in organics. Fourth, attention is given to the application of RRAMs for data storage, including their current performance, methods for performance enhancement, sneak-path issue and possible solutions, and demonstrations of 2-D and 3-D crossbar arrays. Fifth, prospective applications of RRAMs in unconventional computing, as well as logic devices and multi-functionalization of RRAMs, are comprehensively summarized and thoroughly discussed. The present review article ends with a short discussion concerning the challenges and future prospects of the RRAMs."}{"Grain boundary segregation engineering in metallic alloys: A pathway to the design of interfaces ": "Grain boundaries influence mechanical, functional, and kinetic properties of metallic alloys. They can be manipulated via solute decoration enabling changes in energy, mobility, structure, and cohesion or even promoting local phase transformation. In the approach which we refer here to as \u2018segregation engineering\u2019 solute decoration is not regarded as an undesired phenomenon but is instead utilized to manipulate specific grain boundary structures, compositions and properties that enable useful material behavior. The underlying thermodynamics follow the adsorption isotherm. Hence, matrix-solute combinations suited for designing interfaces in metallic alloys can be identified by considering four main aspects, namely, the segregation coefficient of the decorating element; its effects on interface cohesion, energy, structure and mobility; its diffusion coefficient; and the free energies of competing bulk phases, precipitate phases or complexions. From a practical perspective, segregation engineering in alloys can be usually realized by a modest diffusion heat treatment, hence, making it available in large scale manufacturing."}{"Dislocation interactions with grain boundaries ": "Recent progress in understanding dislocation interactions with grain boundaries and interfaces in metallic systems via static and in situ dynamic experimental approaches is reviewed."}{"Activated carbon derived from rice husk by NaOH activation and its application in supercapacitor ": "Four activated carbon (AC) samples prepared from rice husk under different activation temperatures have been characterized by N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA\u2013DTA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The specific surface area of AC sample reached 2681m2\n                     g\u22121 under activation temperature of 800\u00b0C. The AC samples were then tested as electrode material; the specific capacitance of the as-prepared activated carbon electrode was found to be 172.3Fg\u22121 using cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 5mVs\u22121 and 198.4Fg\u22121 at current density 1000mAg\u22121 in the charge/discharge mode."}{"Interfacial characterization of SLM parts in multi-material processing: Metallurgical diffusion between 316L stainless steel and C18400 copper alloy ": "Multi-material processing in selective laser melting using a novel approach, by the separation of two different materials within a single dispensing coating system was investigated. 316L stainless steel and UNS C18400 Cu alloy multi-material samples were produced using selective laser melting and their interfacial characteristics were analyzed using focused ion beam, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron back scattered diffraction techniques. A substantial amount of Fe and Cu element diffusion was observed at the bond interface suggesting good metallurgical bonding. Quantitative evidence of good bonding at the interface was also obtained from the tensile tests where the fracture was initiated at the copper region. Nevertheless, the tensile strength of steel/Cu SLM parts was evaluated to be 310\u00b118MPa and the variation in microhardness values was found to be gradual along the bonding interface from the steel region (256\u00b17HV0.1) to the copper region (72\u00b13HV0.1)."}{"Application of corrosion inhibitors for steels in acidic media for the oil and gas industry: A review ": "This review summarizes the corrosion inhibition of steel materials in acidic media. Numerous corrosion inhibitors for steels in acidic solutions are presented. The emphasis is on HCl solutions, lower-grade steels, and elevated temperatures. This review is also devoted to corrosion inhibitor formulation design \u2013 mixtures of corrosion inhibitors with (mainly) surfactants, solvents, and intensifiers to improve the effectiveness of individual compounds at elevated temperatures. The information presented in this review is useful for diverse industrial fields, primarily for the well acidizing procedure, and secondly for other applications where corrosion inhibitors for steel materials are needed."}{"On the use of nanocellulose as reinforcement in polymer matrix composites ": "Nanocellulose is often being regarded as the next generation renewable reinforcement for the production of high performance biocomposites. This feature article reviews the various nanocellulose reinforced polymer composites reported in literature and discusses the potential of nanocellulose as reinforcement for the production of renewable high performance polymer nanocomposites. The theoretical and experimentally determined tensile properties of nanocellulose are also reviewed. In addition to this, the reinforcing ability of BC and NFC is juxtaposed. In order to analyse the various cellulose-reinforced polymer nanocomposites reported in literature, Cox\u2013Krenchel and rule-of-mixture models have been used to elucidate the potential of nanocellulose in composite applications. There may be potential for improvement since the tensile modulus and strength of most cellulose nanocomposites reported in literature scale linearly with the tensile modulus and strength of the cellulose nanopaper structures. Better dispersion of individual cellulose nanofibres in the polymer matrix may improve composite properties."}{"Highly oriented carbon fiber\u2013polymer composites via additive manufacturing ": "Additive manufacturing is distinguished from traditional manufacturing techniques such as casting and machining by its ability to handle complex shapes with great design flexibility and without the typical waste. Although this technique has been mainly used for rapid prototyping, interest is growing in direct manufacture of actual parts. For wide spread application of 3D additive manufacturing, both techniques and feedstock materials require improvements to meet the mechanical requirements of load-bearing components. Here, we investigated short fiber (0.2\u20130.4mm) reinforced acrylonitrile\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene composites as a feedstock for 3D-printing in terms of their processibility, microstructure and mechanical performance. The additive components are also compared with traditional compression molded composites. The tensile strength and modulus of 3D-printed samples increased \u223c115% and \u223c700%, respectively. 3D-printing yielded samples with very high fiber orientation in the printing direction (up to 91.5%), whereas, compression molding process yielded samples with significantly lower fiber orientation. Microstructure\u2013mechanical property relationships revealed that although a relatively high porosity is observed in 3D-printed composites as compared to those produced by the conventional compression molding technique, they both exhibited comparable tensile strength and modulus. This phenomenon is explained based on the changes in fiber orientation, dispersion and void formation."}{"Carbon fiber surfaces and composite interphases ": "Carbon fiber reinforcements with an excellent mechanical performance to weight ratio are primarily preferred for advanced composite applications. The poor interfacial adhesion between carbon fiber surfaces and polymer molecules caused intrinsically by hydrophobicity and chemical inertness of carbon is a long existing issue to overcome. The article intends to review the research work carried out over the past couple of years in the area of carbon fiber surface modifications and carbon fiber/polymer interfacial adhesion. This paper provides a systematic and up-to-date account of various \u2018wet\u2019, \u2018dry\u2019 and \u2018multi-scale\u2019 fiber surface modification techniques, i.e., sizing, plasma, chemical treatments and carbon nano-tubes/nano-particles coating, for increasing the wettability and interfacial adhesion with polymeric matrices. The review highlights strategies for retaining the carbon fiber mechanical strength after surface modification and stresses its significance."}{"Preparation of MXene-Cu2O nanocomposite and effect on thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate ": "MXenes are novel graphene-like 2-D materials. Cu2O is an effective additive for thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP). We reported the synthesis of MXene (Ti3C2), Cu2O and MXene-Cu2O respectively. The samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Results indicate that the MXene is composed of lots of nano-sheets and the thickness is 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0nm, and Cu2O nanoparticles nucleate and grow heterogeneously directly on the surface of MXene. The effect of these MXene, Cu2O and MXene-Cu2O samples on the thermal decomposition of AP were investigated using TG-DSC. The results revealed that MXene-Cu2O have a great influence on the thermal decomposition of AP than that of pure MXene and Cu2O."}{"First-principles thermodynamic description of hydrogen electroadsorption on the Pt(111) surface ": "The issue of hydrogen (H) electroadsorption on Pt(111) is revisited to settle its theoretical description within the conventional ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface modeling and the semilocal Kohn\u2013Sham level of the density functional theory (DFT). By performing a converged DFT calculation, we have confirmed nearly degenerated nature of H on the fcc hollow site (Hfcc) and H on the top site (Htop) when the nuclei are treated classically, while Hfcc is significantly more stable when the zero-point energy correction is applied. Relative abundance of the Hfcc over Htop was investigated by performing a Monte Carlo simulation using a lattice gas model parameterized by the DFT calculation. By comparing the calculated results with recent cyclic voltammetry data, we found good agreement between theory and experiment but minor discrepancy exists in that the H\u2013H interaction is underestimated by ~10%. Possible origin of the discrepancy is the hydration effect neglected in our model although we cannot exclude the possibility that error of the semilocal approximation within DFT will also play a role."}{"The social dynamics of healthy food shopping and store choice in an urban environment ": "To respond to the high prevalence of obesity and its associated health consequences, recent food research and policy have focused on neighborhood food environments, especially the links between health and retail mix, proximity of food outlets, and types of foods available. In addition, the social environment exerts important influences on food-related behaviors, through mechanisms like role-modeling, social support, and social norms. This study examined the social dynamics of residents' health-related food-shopping behaviors in 2010\u201311 in urban Philadelphia, where we conducted 25 semi-structured resident interviews\u2014the foundation for this paper\u2014in addition to 514 structured interviews and a food environment audit. In interviews, participants demonstrated adaptability and resourcefulness in their food shopping; they chose to shop at stores that met a range of social needs. Those needs ranged from practical financial considerations, to fundamental issues of safety, to mundane concerns about convenience, and juggling multiple work and family responsibilities. The majority of participants were highly motivated to adapt their shopping patterns to accommodate personal financial constraints. In addition, they selectively shopped at stores frequented by people who shared their race/ethnicity, income and education, and they sought stores where they had positive interactions with personnel and proprietors. In deciding where to shop in this urban context, participants adapted their routines to avoid unsafe places and the threat of violence. Participants also discussed the importance of convenient stores that allowed for easy parking, accommodation of physical disabilities or special needs, and integration of food shopping into other daily activities like meeting children at school. Food research and policies should explicitly attend to the social dynamics that influence food-shopping behavior. In our social relationships, interactions, and responsibilities, there are countless opportunities to influence\u2014and also to improve\u2014health."}{"Attitudes to vaccination: A critical review ": "This paper provides a consolidated overview of public and healthcare professionals' attitudes towards vaccination in Europe by bringing together for the first time evidence across various vaccines, countries and populations. The paper relies on an extensive review of empirical literature published in English after 2009, as well as an analysis of unpublished market research data from member companies of Vaccines Europe. Our synthesis suggests that hesitant attitudes to vaccination are prevalent and may be increasing since the influenza pandemic of 2009. We define hesitancy as an expression of concern or doubt about the value or safety of vaccination. This means that hesitant attitudes are not confined only to those who refuse vaccination or those who encourage others to refuse vaccination. For many people, vaccination attitudes are shaped not just by healthcare professionals but also by an array of other information sources, including online and social media sources. We find that healthcare professionals report increasing challenges to building a trustful relationship with patients, through which they might otherwise allay concerns and reassure hesitant patients. We also find a range of reasons for vaccination attitudes, only some of which can be characterised as being related to lack of awareness or misinformation. Reasons that relate to issues of mistrust are cited more commonly in the literature than reasons that relate to information deficit. The importance of trust in the institutions involved with vaccination is discussed in terms of implications for researchers and policy-makers; we suggest that rebuilding this trust is a multi-stakeholder problem requiring a co-ordinated strategy."}{"Are public\u2013private partnerships a healthy option? A systematic literature review ": "Governments around the world, but especially in Europe, have increasingly used private sector involvement in developing, financing and providing public health infrastructure and service delivery through public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). Reasons for this uptake are manifold ranging from rising expenditures for refurbishing, maintaining and operating public assets, and increasing constraints on government budgets stifle, seeking innovation through private sector acumen and aiming for better risk management. Although PPPs have attracted practitioner and academic interest over the last two decades, there has been no attempt to integrate the general and health management literature to provide a holistic view of PPPs in healthcare delivery. This study analyzes over 1400 publications from a wide range of disciplines over a 20-year time period. We find that despite the scale and significance of the phenomenon, there is relatively limited conceptualization and in-depth empirical investigation. Based on bibliographic and content analyses, we synthesize formerly dispersed research perspectives into a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework of public-private partnerships. In so doing, we provide new directions for further research and practice."}{"Incorporating intersectionality theory into population health research methodology: Challenges and the potential to advance health equity ": "Intersectionality theory, developed to address the non-additivity of effects of sex/gender and race/ethnicity but extendable to other domains, allows for the potential to study health and disease at different intersections of identity, social position, processes of oppression or privilege, and policies or institutional practices. Intersectionality has the potential to enrich population health research through improved validity and greater attention to both heterogeneity of effects and causal processes producing health inequalities. Moreover, intersectional population health research may serve to both test and generate new theories. Nevertheless, its implementation within health research to date has been primarily through qualitative research. In this paper, challenges to incorporation of intersectionality into population health research are identified or expanded upon. These include: 1) confusion of quantitative terms used metaphorically in theoretical work with similar-sounding statistical methods; 2) the question of whether all intersectional positions are of equal value, or even of sufficient value for study; 3) distinguishing between intersecting identities, social positions, processes, and policies or other structural factors; 4) reflecting embodiment in how processes of oppression and privilege are measured and analysed; 5) understanding and utilizing appropriate scale for interactions in regression models; 6) structuring interaction or risk modification to best convey effects, and; 7) avoiding assumptions of equidistance or single level in the design of analyses. Addressing these challenges throughout the processes of conceptualizing and planning research and in conducting analyses has the potential to improve researchers' ability to more specifically document inequalities at varying intersectional positions, and to study the potential individual- and group-level causes that may drive these observed inequalities. A greater and more thoughtful incorporation of intersectionality can promote the creation of evidence that is directly useful in population-level interventions such as policy changes, or that is specific enough to be applicable within the social contexts of affected communities."}{"Income inequality and health: A causal review ": "There is a very large literature examining income inequality in relation to health. Early reviews came to different interpretations of the evidence, though a large majority of studies reported that health tended to be worse in more unequal societies. More recent studies, not included in those reviews, provide substantial new evidence. Our purpose in this paper is to assess whether or not wider income differences play a causal role leading to worse health. We conducted a literature review within an epidemiological causal framework and inferred the likelihood of a causal relationship between income inequality and health (including violence) by considering the evidence as a whole. The body of evidence strongly suggests that income inequality affects population health and wellbeing. The major causal criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of studies which find no association, most can be explained by income inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too short.\n                  The evidence that large income differences have damaging health and social consequences is strong and in most countries inequality is increasing. Narrowing the gap will improve the health and wellbeing of populations."}{"The influence of fabric surface characteristics on satellite bloodstain morphology ": "Bloodstains on fabrics such as clothing, soft furnishings or carpets are often encountered in casework. These stains often have a distinctive morphology that includes satellite stains, thought to be a highly sensitive feature that is a function of surface roughness. This study presents the findings of experimental studies conducted with proxy blood on two fabrics, similar in labeled composition, to assess the influence of fabric type on satellite stain generation. The morphology of proxy blood stains on the two fabric types were found to be statistically distinguishable from one another, with the volume of satellite stains generated being dependent upon the surface roughness of the fabric. These findings provide an initial step that illustrates the viability of providing an empirical evidence base for the interpretation of satellite stains in forensic blood pattern analysis (BPA)."}{"The surface chemistry of cerium oxide ": "This review covers the structure of, and chemical reactions on, well-defined cerium oxide surfaces. Ceria, or mixed oxides containing ceria, are critical components in automotive three-way catalysts due to their well-known oxygen storage capacity. Ceria is also emerging as an important material in a number of other catalytic processes, particularly those involving organic oxygenates and the water\u2013gas shift reaction. Ceria\u05f3s acid\u2013base properties, and thus its catalytic behavior, are closely related to its surface structure where different oxygen anion and cerium cation environments are present on the low-index structural faces. The actual structure of these various faces has been the focus of a number of theoretical and experimental investigations. Ceria is also easily reducible from CeO2 to CeO2\u2212X\n                     . The presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface often dramatically alters the adsorption and subsequent reactions of various adsorbates, either on a clean surface or on metal particles supported on the surface. Most surface science studies have been conducted on the surfaces of thin-films rather than on the surfaces of bulk single crystal oxides. The growth, characterization and properties of these thin-films are also examined."}{"Synthesis and surface functionalization of silica nanoparticles for nanomedicine ": "There are a wide variety of silica nanoformulations being investigated for biomedical applications. Silica nanoparticles can be produced using a wide variety of synthetic techniques with precise control over their physical and chemical characteristics. Inorganic nanoformulations are often criticized or neglected for their poor tolerance; however, extensive studies into silica nanoparticle biodistributions and toxicology have shown that silica nanoparticles may be well tolerated, and in some case are excreted or are biodegradable. Robust synthetic techniques have allowed silica nanoparticles to be developed for applications such as biomedical imaging contrast agents, ablative therapy sensitizers, and drug delivery vehicles. This review explores the synthetic techniques used to create and modify an assortment of silica nanoformulations, as well as several of the diagnostic and therapeutic applications."}{"Pharmaceutical particle technologies: An approach to improve drug solubility, dissolution and bioavailability ": "Pharmaceutical particle technology is employed to improve poor aqueous solubility of drug compounds that limits in\u00a0vivo bioavailability owing to their low dissolution rate in the gastrointestinal fluids following oral administration. The particle technology involves several approaches from the conventional size reduction processes to the newer, novel particle technologies that modify the solubility properties of the drugs and produce solid, powdered form of the drugs that are readily soluble in water and can be easily formulated into various dosage forms. This review highlights the solid particle technologies available for improving solubility, dissolution and bioavailability of drugs with poor aqueous solubility."}{"A review on phospholipids and their main applications in drug delivery systems ": "Phospholipids have the characteristics of excellent biocompatibility and a especial amphiphilicity. These unique properties make phospholipids most appropriate to be employed as important pharmaceutical excipients and they have a very wide range of applications in drug delivery systems. The aim of this review is to summarize phospholipids and some of their related applications in drug delivery systems, and highlight the relationship between the properties and applications, and the effect of the species of phospholipids on the efficiency of drug delivery. We refer to some relevant literatures, starting from the structures, main sources and properties of phospholipids to introduce their applications in drug delivery systems. The present article focuses on introducing five types of carriers based on phospholipids, including liposomes, intravenous lipid emulsions, micelles, drug-phospholipids complexes and cochleates."}{"A practical guide to pharmaceutical polymorph screening & selection ": "Prevalence and importance of polymorphism occurring in pharmaceutical compounds are well recognized.

Fine drug particulates are especially desired in formulations designed for parenteral, respiratory and transdermal use. Most drugs after crystallization may have to be comminuted and this physical transformation is required to various extents, often to enhance processability or solubility especially for drugs with limited aqueous solubility. The mechanisms by which milling enhances drug dissolution and solubility include alterations in the size, specific surface area and shape of the drug particles as well as milling-induced amorphization and/or structural disordering of the drug crystal (mechanochemical activation). Technology advancements in milling now enable the production of drug micro- and nano-particles on a commercial scale with relative ease. This review will provide a background on milling followed by the introduction of common milling techniques employed for the micronization and nanonization of drugs. Salient information contained in the cited examples are further extracted and summarized for ease of reference by researchers keen on employing these techniques for drug solubility and bioavailability enhancement."}{"Studies on thermoresponsive polymers: Phase behaviour, drug delivery and biomedical applications ": "The present review aims to highlight the applications of thermoresponsive polymers. Thermo-responsive polymers show a sharp change in properties upon a small or modest change in temperature. This behaviour can be utilized for the preparation of so-called \u2018smart\u2019 drug delivery systems, which mimic biological response behaviour to a certain extent. Such materials are used in the development of several applications, such as drug delivery systems, tissue engineering scaffolds and gene delivery. Advances in this field are particularly relevant to applications in the areas of regenerative medicine and drug delivery. This review addresses summary of the main applications of thermoresponsive polymers which are categorized based on their 3-dimensional structure; hydrogels, interpenetrating networks, micelles, films and particles. The physico-chemical behaviour underlying the phase transition is also discussed in brief."}{"Nanocrystals for enhancement of oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs ": "Nanocrystals, a carrier-free colloidal delivery system in nano-sized range, is an interesting approach for poorly soluble drugs. Nanocrystals provide special features including enhancement of saturation solubility, dissolution velocity and adhesiveness to surface/cell membranes. Several strategies are applied for nanocrystals production including precipitation, milling, high pressure homogenization and combination methods such as NanoEdge\u2122, SmartCrystal and Precipitation-lyophilization-homogenization (PLH) technology. For oral administration, many publications reported useful advantages of nanocrystals to improve in\u00a0vivo performances i.e.\u00a0pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and targeted delivery which were discussed in this review. Additionally, transformation of nanocrystals to final formulations and future trends of nanocrystals were also described."}{"High loading capacity of Fe3+ cations in LBL films made from poly(ethyleneimine) and tannic acid: An alternative to coordination driven multistep assembly using polyphenols and Fe3+\n             ": "Thin films incorporating tannic acid and Fe3+ ions appear as a versatile method to coat almost all surfaces in a one pot reaction or in a step-by-step manner. Both kinds of films display different optical properties and the films deposited in a step-by-step manner are more impermeable for FITC labeled dextran than the one pot deposited equivalents. Herein, tannic acid is deposited in a step by-step manner with poly(ethyleneimine) to yield linearly growing films able to incorporate Fe3+ cations in an irreversible manner and in an amount which is proportional to the film thickness. The stoichiometry of iron/tannic acid in the film was found to be close to 10 when the films were incubated with Fe(NO3)3. 9 H2O at 2.48\u00d710\u22123\n                     mol\u00b7L\u22121. This exceptional loading capacity may be exploited for environmental purposes. Cu2+ cations can also be loaded in the films."}{"Influence of the Disjoining Pressure on the Equilibrium Interfacial Profile in Transition Zone Between a Thin Film and a Capillary Meniscus ": "The behaviour of liquid layers on solid substrates depends on a number of factors, the most important of which is the action of surface forces in the vicinity of the three phase contact line. The equilibrium interfacial (gas/liquid) profile in the transition zone between the thin flat film and the spherical part of a meniscus is determined by the combined action of the disjoining/conjoining and capillary pressures. The disjoining/conjoining pressure is considered to include the electrostatic, van der Waals and structural components. The Poisson\u2013Boltzmann equation is also solved with various boundary conditions to calculate the electrostatic component of the disjoining/conjoining pressure. Wetting conditions are considered and the interfacial profile is determined for various parameters governing the surface interactions, as well as the ratio between the disjoining/conjoining and capillary pressures."}{"Design and analysis of pioneering high supersonic axial turbines ": "The trend towards ultra compact thermal power generation, is constrained by the unavailability of fluid-machinery adequate for supersonic flow conditions. Conventional turbine designs exhibit unacceptable performances related to large aerodynamic losses and a narrow operation range. This paper provides for the first time in the open literature the design procedure, and subsequent analysis of the turbine performance of a turbine adequate for supersonic axial pulsating flows, as those encountered in innovative combustors. The design approach considers the most adverse condition, a steady inlet axial Mach number equal to 3.5. The possible turbine families were classified by the velocity triangles and discussed. A fundamental issue in supersonic passages is to ensure the normal shock at the start of the engine is swallowed through the turbine passages, namely the turbine passage is started. To ensure self-starting capability the turning is restricted to lower values than in the conventional subsonic turbines. The design procedure was based on the method of characteristics, converting the inlet uniform flow into a vortex flow field, such that the adequate deflection is inflicted to the supersonic flow. The performance of the supersonic passage was first assessed and then compared to conventional designs. The present design procedure and analysis of unconventional supersonic turbines provides guidelines for the design and optimization of efficient high supersonic passages, suitable to future tightly packed fluid machinery."}{"The future of automotive lithium-ion battery recycling: Charting a sustainable course ": "This paper looks ahead, beyond the projected large-scale market penetration of vehicles containing advanced batteries, to the time when the spent batteries will be ready for final disposition. It describes a working system for recycling, using lead\u2013acid battery recycling as a model. Recycling of automotive lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is more complicated and not yet established because few end-of-life batteries will need recycling for another decade. There is thus the opportunity now to obviate some of the technical, economic, and institutional roadblocks that might arise. The paper considers what actions can be started now to avoid the impediments to recycling and ensure that economical and sustainable options are available at the end of the batteries' useful life."}{"Why nuclear energy is sustainable and has to be part of the energy mix ": "Humanity must face the reality that it cannot depend indefinitely on combustion of coal, gas and oil for most of its energy needs. In the unavoidable process of gradually replacing fossil fuels, many energy technologies may be considered and most will be deployed in specific applications. However, in the long term, we argue that nuclear fission technology is the only developed energy source that is capable of delivering the enormous quantities of energy that will be needed to run modern industrial societies safely, economically, reliably and in a sustainable way, both environmentally and as regards the available resource base. Consequently, nuclear fission has to play a major role in this necessary transformation of the 21st century energy-supply system.\n                  In a first phase of this necessary global energy transformation, the emphasis should be on converting the major part of the world's electrical energy generation capacity from fossil fuels to nuclear fission. This can realistically be achieved within a few decades, as has already been done in France during the 1970s and 1980s. Such an energy transformation would reduce the global emissions of carbon dioxide profoundly, as well as cutting other significant greenhouse gases like methane. Industrial nations should take the lead in this transition.\n                  Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, replacing coal-fired generating stations with gas-fired stations will not necessarily result in a reduction of the rate of greenhouse-gas emission even for relatively low leakage rates of the natural gas into the atmosphere.\n                  The energy sources popularly known as \u2018renewables\u2019 (such as wind and solar), will be hard pressed to supply the needed quantities of energy sustainably, economically and reliably. They are inherently intermittent, depending on backup power or on energy storage if they are to be used for delivery of base-load electrical energy to the grid. This backup power has to be flexible and is derived in most cases from combustion of fossil fuels (mainly natural gas). If used in this way, intermittent energy sources do not meet the requirements of sustainability, nor are they economically viable because they require redundant, under-utilized investment in capacity both for generation and for transmission.\n                  Intermittent energy installations, in conjunction with gas-fired backup power installations, will in many cases be found to have a combined rate of greenhouse-gas emission that is higher than that of stand-alone coal-fired generating stations of equal generating capacity. A grid connection fee, to be imposed on countries with a large intermittent generating capacity, should be considered for the purpose of compensating adjacent countries for the use of their interconnected electric grids as back-up power. Also, intermittent energy sources tend to negatively affect grid stability, especially as their market penetration rises.\n                  The alternative \u2014 dedicated energy storage for grid-connected intermittent energy sources (instead of backup power) \u2014 is in many cases not yet economically viable. However, intermittent sources plus storage may be economically competitive for local electricity supply in geographically isolated regions without access to a large electric grid. Yet nuclear fission energy will, even then, be required for the majority displacement of fossil fuels this century."}{"Thermoelectric generators: Linking material properties and systems engineering for waste heat recovery applications ": "Waste-heat recovery with thermoelectric power generators can improve energy efficiency and provide distributed electricity generation. New thermoelectric materials and material performance improvements motivate development of thermoelectric generators for numerous applications with excess exhaust and process heat. However, thermoelectric generator product development requires solving coupled challenges in materials development and systems engineering. This review discusses these challenges and indicates ways system-level performance relies on more factors than traditional thermoelectric material performance metrics alone. Relevant thermo-mechanical and chemical material properties, system components such as thermal interface materials and heat exchangers, and system form factors are examined. Manufacturing processes and total system cost components are evaluated to provide product development and commercial feasibility contexts."}{"A continuously variable transmission for efficient urban transportation ": "This paper describes a new continuously variable transmission (CVT) that may be used in a variety of machines and transport devices. Unlike many CVTs that are relatively heavy and bulky, the present CVT, named \u201ceDrive\u201d, is fairly small and lightweight. These attributes allow eDrive to be used in human-powered transport devices such as bicycles. The eDrive incorporates a sprocket able to vary its effective diameter via computer controlled actuation. The sprocket accommodates a rotational input and provides an output using a loop belt rotationally engaged with sprocket. The eDrive promises to increase a bicyclist's user experience, provide more efficient conversion of human energy to locomotion, and overall promote sustainable urban transportation. In addition, eDrive can be configured and scaled to provide CVT functionality for a variety of other vehicles and machines, such as wind or water turbines and electric vehicles."}{"Capturing CO2 from ambient air using a polyethyleneimine\u2013silica adsorbent in fluidized beds ": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) uses a combination of technologies to capture, transport and store carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large point sources such as coal or natural gas-fired power plants. Capturing CO2 from ambient air has been considered as a carbon-negative technology to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the air. The performance of a mesoporous silica-supported polyethyleneimine (PEI)\u2013silica adsorbent for CO2 capture from ambient air has been evaluated in a laboratory-scale Bubbling Fluidized Bed (BFB) reactor. The air capture tests lasted for between 4 and 14 days using 1kg of the PEI\u2013silica adsorbent in the BFB reactor. Despite the low CO2 concentration in ambient air, nearly 100% CO2 capture efficiency has been achieved with a relatively short gas\u2013solid contact time of 7.5s. The equilibrium CO2 adsorption capacity for air capture was found to be as high as 7.3wt%, which is amongst the highest values reported to date. A conceptual design is completed to evaluate the technological and economic feasibility of using PEI\u2013silica adsorbent to capture CO2 from ambient air at a large scale of capturing 1Mt-CO2 per year. The proposed novel \u201cPEI-CFB air capture system\u201d mainly comprises a Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) adsorber and a BFB desorber with a CO2 capture capacity of 40t-CO2/day. Large pressure drop is required to drive the air through the CFB adsorber and also to suspend and circulate the solid adsorbents within the loop, resulting in higher electricity demand than other reported air capture systems. However, the Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) technology adopted for the regeneration strategy in the separate BFB desorber has resulted in much smaller thermal energy requirement. The total energy required is 6.6GJ/t-CO2 which is comparable to other reference air capture systems. By projecting a future scenario where decarbonization of large point energy sources has been largely implemented by integration of CCS technologies, the operating cost under this scenario is estimated to be $108/t-CO2 captured and $152/t-CO2 avoided with an avoided fraction of 0.71. Further research on the proposed 40t-CO2/day \u2018PEI-CFB Air Capture System\u2019 is still needed which should include the evaluation of the capital costs and the experimental investigation of air capture using a laboratory-scale CFB system with the PEI\u2013silica adsorbent."}{"Photochemical splitting of water for hydrogen production by photocatalysis: A review ": "Hydrogen production from water using a catalyst and solar energy is an ideal future fuel source. The search for suitable semiconductors as photocatalysts for water splitting into molecular hydrogen and oxygen has been considered to be an urgent subject for our daily life. In this review, we aim to focus on the research efforts that have been made so far for H2 generation from water splitting by UV and visible light-driven photocatalysis. A number of synthetic modification methods for adapting the electronic structure to enhance the charge separation in the photocatalyst materials are discussed. Sacrificial reagents and electron mediators for the overall water splitting are also reviewed. The quantum efficiency of photocatalyst materials upon visible and UV illumination will be reviewed, summarized and discussed."}{"Security Testing Methodology for Vulnerabilities Detection of XSS in Web Services and WS-Security ": "Due to its distributed and open nature, Web Services give rise to new security challenges. This technology is susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack, which takes advantage of existing vulnerabilities. The proposed approach makes use of two Security Testing techniques, namely Penetration Testing and Fault Injection, in order to emulate XSS attack against Web Services. This technology, combined with WS-Security (WSS) and Security Tokens, can identify the sender and guarantee the legitimate access control to the SOAP messages exchanged. We use the vulnerability scanner soapUI that is one of the most recognized tools of Penetration Testing. In contrast, WSInject is a new fault injection tool, which introduces faults or errors on Web Services to analyze the behavior in an environment not robust. The results show that the use of WSInject, in comparison to soapUI, improves the detection of vulnerability allows to emulate XSS attack and generates new types of them."}{"A Framework to Generate Synthetic Multi-label Datasets ": "A controlled environment based on known properties of the dataset used by a learning algorithm is useful to empirically evaluate machine learning algorithms. Synthetic (artificial) datasets are used for this purpose. Although there are publicly available frameworks to generate synthetic single-label datasets, this is not the case for multi-label datasets, in which each instance is associated with a set of labels usually correlated. This work presents Mldatagen, a multi-label dataset generator framework we have implemented, which is publicly available to the community. Currently, two strategies have been implemented in Mldatagen: hypersphere and hypercube. For each label in the multi-label dataset, these strategies randomly generate a geometric shape (hypersphere or hypercube), which is populated with points (instances) randomly generated. Afterwards, each instance is labeled according to the shapes it belongs to, which defines its multi-label. Experiments with a multi-label classification algorithm in six synthetic datasets illustrate the use of Mldatagen."}
