{"MatCALO: Knowledge-enabled machine learning in materials science ": "Industrial and technological innovations constantly call for the development of materials that meet specific and novel requirement profiles. However, the engineering of materials with the desired properties is a time-, cost-, and labor-intensive process as changing the composition and the parameterization of processing steps yields an unimaginably large search space. It is therefore crucial for the future engineering of materials to be conducted in a more goal-directed and more efficient way to generate informative hypotheses revealing particularly promising experiments and thus guiding the exploration process in a more informed fashion. In this paper, we present MatCALO, an intelligent, cognitive assistant system that supports materials scientists in developing novel materials. MatCALO combines modern machine learning techniques with machine-interpretable semantic knowledge in order to model representations of relationships between materials, processes and properties and allow reasoning about them. We showcase a prototypical approach for generating such hypotheses by reverse-querying regression models learned from experimental data. However, a workable set of experiments alone generally does not suffice as it will never cover an adequately large area of the search space, which led us to the conclusion that additional background knowledge is required to build more reliable models. The readers can assure themselves of the feasibility of this approach by testing the web-based interface using the MatCALO system which will be made available to the broad community. Given a requirement profile, the system generates hypotheses on how these criteria can be achieved."}{"Machine learning guided design of functional materials with targeted properties ": "The impact of machine learning (ML) methods is growing rapidly in materials science. One of the areas where we have shown promise is in the application of ML methods to sequentially guide experiments or computations towards targeted regions in the design space. Here, the need for ML methods is motivated by the fact that the search space is vast and complex. Further, it is intractable for the state-of-the-art high-throughput experimental or computational approaches to navigate the space in an efficient manner. In this review, two examples are discussed that demonstrate the efficacy of classification learning based ML methods in search for new and previously unexplored materials with desired properties. In the first study, ML methods guide density functional theory (DFT) phonon calculations in the design of Ruddlesden-Popper oxides with non-centrosymmetric (NCS) structures. Novel NCS compounds were predicted, whose thermodynamic stabilities were evaluated by DFT convex hull calculations. In the second study, ML methods enabled rapid screening of xBi[\n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 Me\n                              \n                              \n                                 y\n                              \n                              \n                                 \u2032\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 Me\n                              \n                              \n                                 (\n                                 1\n                                 -\n                                 y\n                                 )\n                              \n                              \n                                 \u2033\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     ]O3\u2013(1\u2013x)PbTiO3 compositions in the desired perovskite crystal structure, where \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 Me\n                              \n                              \n                                 \u2032\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                      and \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 Me\n                              \n                              \n                                 \u2033\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                      are two octahedral site cations.

A systematic study is presented by positioning the graphene flake at various depths below the Ni surface and also terminating it at various lateral distances from the indent point. We find that the dislocations generated by the indentation in the vicinity of the indenter never penetrate the graphene flake. However, they can bend around the flake and thus reach positions below it. If the indenter touches the flake, dislocations are nucleated in the Ni layer beyond the flake. In this case, interface cracks between Ni and graphene are created. The composite material has a smaller hardness than pure Ni. This is caused by an attractive interaction of the graphene flake with the Ni dislocations; when the dislocations arrive at the Ni-graphene interface they induce height depressions of the flake that alleviate the pressure in the top Ni layer and weaken the force on the indenter."}{"Oil detachment by modified nanoparticles: A molecular dynamics simulation study ": "Stripping residual oil adsorbed on reservoir surface is essential for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Abundant experimental and modelling have investigations identified the superior EOR capability of Janus nanoparticle. However, the tortuous synthesis procedure and expensive cost heavily limit its large-scale application. In this work, adopting molecular dynamics simulation, three kind of modified nanoparticles grafted with hydrophilic chains (NP1), hydrophobic chains (NP2), and mixed hydrophilic and hydrophobic chains (NP3), were designed to detach adsorbed oil droplet on silica surface. These modified nanoparticles could be prepared via conveniently chemical modification. The equilibrium adsorption configuration and dynamic displacing process were investigated. Simulations indicate that the grafted nanoparticles could promote the oil droplet detachment, and the NP3 gives optimal EOR capability. Furthermore, the interaction between oil droplet and silica surface, oil/water interfacial activity, and coherent energy of oil droplet, were analyzed to reveal the underlying EOR mechanism of grafted nanoparticles. This work provides one kind of modified nanoparticle (NP3) for the development of high-performance EOR agent."}{"Research on mechanism of nanoscale cutting with arc trajectory for monocrystalline silicon based on molecular dynamics simulation ": "Movement trajectory of diamond tool during an ultra-precision cutting may be nonlinear due to external vibrations. Hence, we investigate nanoscale cutting of monocrystalline silicon using molecular dynamics simulation when the diamond tool trajectory contains an arc segment. Surface morphology, atomic displacement, radial distribution function, coordination values, common neighbor analysis, temperature variation and distribution of von Mises stress and hydrostatic stress are studied by changing the arc radius of tool path. An optimal surface integrity for the workpieces is obtained when the arc radius is 30\u202f\u00c5. Displacement vector analysis shows that the atoms at the initial position between the diamond tool and the workpiece have relatively large displacement. Furthermore, cutting distance has great influence on radial distribution function and atomic coordination values. Dislocation analysis indicates that the subsurface of workpiece with the arc radius of 30\u202f\u00c5 is the smoothest, while temperature analysis reveals that only the maximum temperature of this workpiece exceeds 1000\u202fK. Finally, the stress analysis indicates that the average hydrostatic stress decreases before increasing with the arc radius. For comparison, the average von Mises stress increases gradually. In addition, peak value of the two average stresses resides at the middle and the end of the arc, respectively. The curve trajectory of the tool results in the concentration of the hydrostatic stress and the von Mises stress in the local region of workpiece subsurface."}{"PRISMS-Plasticity: An open-source crystal plasticity finite element software ": "An open-source parallel 3-D crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) software package PRISMS-Plasticity is presented here as a part of PRISMS integrated framework. A highly efficient rate-independent crystal plasticity algorithm is implemented along with developing its algorithmic tangent modulus. Additionally, a twin activation mechanism is incorporated into the framework based on an integration point sensitive scheme. The integration of the software as a part of the PRISMS framework is demonstrated. To do so, the integration of the PRISMS-Plasticity software with experimental characterization techniques such as electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction using available open source software packages of DREAM.3D and Neper is elaborated. The integration of the PRISMS-Plasticity software with the information repository of Materials Commons is also presented. The parallel performance of the software is characterized which demonstrates that it scales well for large problems running on hundreds of processors. Various examples of polycrystalline metals with face-centered cubic (FCC), body-centered cubic (BCC), and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystals structures are presented to show the capability of the software to efficiently solve crystal plasticity boundary value problems, in addition to integration with preprocessing and postprocessing tools. PRISMS-Plasticity is an important activity within the broader PRISMS Center and future enhancements to PRISMS-Plasticity are planned and will be described."}{"Towards machine learning approaches for predicting the self-healing efficiency of materials ": "Self-healing materials with an inherent repair mechanism have been widely studied. However, the self-healing efficiencies of most materials can only be measured by laboratory-based experiments, which can be time consuming and expensive. Inspired by modern machine learning approaches, we are interested in predicting the self-healing efficiency of new bio-hybrid materials, as part of our ongoing EPSRC funded \u201cManufacturing Immortality\u201d project. By modelling existing experimental data, predictive models can be built to forecast self-healing efficiency. This has the potential to reduce the time input required by laboratory experiments, guide material and component selection, and inform hypotheses, thereby facilitating the design of novel self-healing materials. In this position paper, we first present preliminary knowledge and quantitative definitions of the self-healing efficiency of materials. We then demonstrate several widely used machine learning approaches and review an experimental case of predictive modelling based on neural networks. Furthermore, and aiming to expedite self-healing material development, we propose an on-line ensemble learning framework as the whole system model for the optimization of predictive computational models. Finally, the rationality of our on-line ensemble learning framework is experimentally studied and validated."}{"A crystal-plasticity model of extruded AM30 magnesium alloy ": "An enhanced crystal-plasticity finite-element model is developed to model the effects of texture, grain size and loading direction on asymmetrical tension-compression behaviour of AM30 magnesium alloy. A constitutive description of plastic deformation in the suggested scheme accounts for contributions from deformation slip and twinning. The calibrated model was employed to investigate the effects of texture and grain size on the yield stress and strain-hardening behaviour of AM30 magnesium alloy at room temperatures under various loading conditions. The study reveals that grain refinement and initial texture significantly influence the mechanical behaviour of AM30. Results show that the key factor controlling the tension-compression asymmetry is deformation twinning. Two techniques, which could be used to reduce this asymmetry, are grain refinement and weakening of the initial texture in extruded AM30."}{"3D printing of Aluminium alloys: Additive Manufacturing of Aluminium alloys using selective laser melting ": "Metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes, such as selective laser melting (SLM), enable the fabrication of arbitrary 3D-structures with unprecedented degrees of freedom. Research is rapidly progressing in this field, with promising results opening up a range of possible applications across both scientific and industrial sectors. Many sectors are now benefiting from fabricating complex structures using AM technologies to achieve the objectives of light-weighting, increased functionality, and part number reduction, among others. AM also lends potential in fulfilling demands for reducing the cost and design-to-manufacture time. Aluminium alloys are of the main material systems receiving attention in SLM research, being favoured in many high-value applications. However, processing them is challenging due to the difficulties associated with laser-melting aluminium where parts suffer various defects. A number of studies in recent years have developed approaches to remedy them and reported successful SLM of various Al-alloys and have gone on to explore its potential application in advanced componentry. This paper reports on recent advancements in this area and highlights some key topics requiring attention for further progression. It aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the interrelation between the various aspects of the subject, as this is essential to demonstrate credibility for industrial needs."}{"Production of large-area 2D materials for high-performance photodetectors by pulsed-laser deposition ": "Our review provides a comprehensive overview on the latest progress in pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) of 2D layered materials (2DLMs), and its application in photoelectric detection. We begin with a retrospective overview on various 2DLMs and their development in photoelectric detection. Then we present the fundamentals of PLD and its unique advantages compared with the traditional growth methods. Subsequently, the PLD growth of 2DLMs and the influence of various parameters are discussed. After this, we describe the current metal-semiconductor-metal and vertical heterojunction photodetectors that incorporate the PLD-grown 2DLMs. This leads into a summary of the strategies used to improve the photosensitivity and in-depth insights into the working mechanism. We then present the PLD-fabricated transparent and flexible 2DLM photodetectors. Finally, we highlight the unresolved issues and propose the future directions in this emerging research field."}{"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy: Towards reliable binding energy referencing ": "With more than 9000 papers published annually, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an indispensable technique in modern surface and materials science for the determination of chemical bonding. The accuracy of chemical-state determination relies, however, on a trustworthy calibration of the binding energy (BE) scale, which is a nontrivial task due to the lack of an internal BE reference. One approach, proposed in the early days of XPS, employs the C 1s spectra of an adventitious carbon layer, which is present on all surfaces exposed to air. Despite accumulating criticism, pointing to the unknown origin and composition of the adventitious carbon, this is by far the most commonly used method today for all types of samples, not necessarily electrically insulating. Alarmingly, as revealed by our survey of recent XPS literature, the calibration procedure based on the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon is highly arbitrary, which results in incorrect spectral interpretation, contradictory results, and generates a large spread in reported BE values for elements even present in the same chemical state. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the status quo of XPS with a historical perspective, provide the technique\u2019s operating principles, resolve myths associated with C 1s referencing, and offer a comprehensive account of recent findings. Owing to the huge volume of XPS literature produced each year, the consequences of improper referencing are dramatic. Our intention is to promote awareness within a growing XPS community as to the problems reported over the last six decades and present a guide with best practice for using the C 1s BE referencing method."}{"Modular fabrication of intelligent material-tissue interfaces for bioinspired and biomimetic devices ": "One of the goals of biomaterials science is to reverse engineer aspects of human and non-human physiology.

This review is a comprehensive evaluation and critical analysis of the design and fabrication of environmentally responsive cell-material constructs for bioinspired machinery and biomimetic devices. In a bottom-up analysis, we begin by reviewing fundamental principles that explain materials\u2019 responses to chemical gradients, biomarkers, electromagnetic fields, light, and temperature. Strategies for fabricating highly ordered assemblies of material components at the nano to macro-scales via directed assembly, lithography, 3D printing and 4D printing are also presented. We conclude with an account of contemporary material-tissue interfaces within bioinspired and biomimetic devices for peptide delivery, cancer theranostics, biomonitoring, neuroprosthetics, soft robotics, and biological machines."}{"Bioprocess-inspired fabrication of materials with new structures and functions ": "Strategies that attempt to mimic the well-defined structures or unique functions of natural biological materials have succeeded in designing and synthesizing bio-inspired materials in the past twenty years.

Hence, natural structure-forming processes are well worth studying in pursuit of new techniques for fabricating advanced materials with novel structures and functions, a new research direction, called \u201cbioprocess-inspired fabrication\u201d has been proposed in recent years. In this review, we systematically introduce and evaluate the advance of bioprocess-inspired fabrication of materials for the first time. We describe advances in the exploration and development of bioprocess-inspired fabrication technology and related exquisite materials.

This ability to design and synthesize engineered OIHP materials has opened the possibility to develop various other optoelectronic applications. In addition to that of photovoltaics, this includes photodetector, laser, light emitting diode, X-ray and gamma detector, photocatalyst, memory, transducer, transistor, and more. At this stage, the emphasis is on fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry of OIHP materials, which will assist the evaluation of device performance and provide explanations for some of the contradictory results reported in literature. This review discusses the theoretical and experimental analysis of the OIHP materials reported from various sources and considers the chemical and structural origin of their unique optoelectronic properties, correlated microstructures, and newly discovered extraordinary properties. In the first few sections, we summarize and discuss the crystallography, chemical bonding, and substitutional effects, followed by the discussion of correlated photophysics including the optical, electronic, excitonic, charge transport, and ion migration characteristics. Next, we revisit and discuss the in-depth behavior of films with unique defect structure, structural disorder, morphology, and crystallization thermodynamics. Novel thermal-electrical-optical properties including ferroelectricity, hot-carrier contribution, spin-orbit coupling effect, terahertz time response, edge-state discovery, etc., are rationalized considering the results debated in the community. We elaborate on the opportunities and challenges regarding stability, toxicity, and hysteresis. The viewpoint on commercialization of OIHP based solar module is presented with the goal of identifying near-term opportunities. Throughout this review, the overarching goal is to provide a simplified explanation for the complex physical effects and mechanisms, underlying interconnections between different mechanisms, uncertainties reported in literature, and recent important theoretical and experimental discoveries."}{"Weldability, microstructure and mechanical properties of laser-welded selective laser melted 304 stainless steel joints ": "Laser welding is a promising process for joining small components produced by selective laser melting (SLM) to fabricate the large-scale and complex-shaped parts. In the work, the morphology, microstructure, microhardness, tensile properties and corrosion resistance of the laser welded stress-relieved SLMed 304 stainless steel joints are investigated, as the different sections of stress-relieved SLMed 304 stainless steel are joined. Results show that the SLMed 304 stainless steel plates have a good laser weldability. The microstructure of laser-welded joints consists of the cellular dendrites in austenite matrix within columnar grains, exhibiting a coarser dendrite structure, lower microhardness (\u223c220\u2009HV) and tensile properties (tensile strength of \u223c750\u2009MPa, and area reduction of \u223c27.6%), but superior corrosion resistance to those of SLMed plates. The dendrite arm spacing of the joints varies from \u223c3.7\u2009\u03bcm in center zone, to \u223c5.0\u2009\u03bcm in fusion zone, to \u223c2.5\u2009\u03bcm in epitaxial zone. The SLMed anisotropy shows a negligible effect on the microstructure and performance of the laser-welded joints. The laser welding along the building directions of the SLMed base plates can induce a slightly finer dendritic structure and higher tensile properties."}{"Microstructure and mechanical properties of Fe\n                  x\n               CoCrNiMn high-entropy alloys ": "The microstructure and tensile properties of Fe\n                        x\n                     CoCrNiMn high-entropy alloys (HEAs) were investigated.

Controlling factors are microgalvanic acceleration between different phases, protection by a continuous second phase distribution, protection by corrosion products, and degradation of protective layers by aggressive species such as chloride ions. The Mg atmospheric corrosion rate increases with relative humidity (RH) and concentrations of aggressive species. Temperature increases the corrosion rate unless a protective film causes a decrease. O2, SO2 and NO2 accelerate the atmospheric corrosion rate, whereas the corrosion rate is decreased by CO2. The traditional gravimetric method can evaluate effectively the corrosion behavior of Mg alloys."}{"Formation and evolution of layered structure in dissimilar welded joints between ferritic-martensitic steel and 316L stainless steel with fillers ": "Dissimilar high-energy beam (HEB) welding is necessary in many industrial applications. Different composition of heat-affected zone (HAZ) and weld metal (WM) lead to variation in mechanical properties within the dissimilar joint, which determines the performance of the welded structure. In the present study, appropriate filler material was used during electron beam welding (EBW) to obtain a reliable dissimilar joint between reduced-activation ferritic-martensitic (RAFM) steel and 316\u202fL austenitic stainless steel. It was observed that the layered structure occurred in the weld metal with 310S filler (310S-WM), which had the inferior resistance to thermal disturbance, leading to severe hardening of 310S-WM after one-step tempering treatment. To further ameliorate the joint inhomogeneity, two-step heat treatment processes were imposed to the joints and optimized. \u03b4-ferrite in the layered structure transformed into \u03b3-phase in the first-step normalizing and remained stable during cooling. In the second-step of tempering, tempered martensite was obtained in the HAZ of the RAFM steel, while the microstructure of 310S-WM was not affected. Thus, the optimized properties for HAZ and 310S-WM in dissimilar welded joint was both obtained by a two-step heat treatment. The creep failure position of two dissimilar joints both occurred in CLAM-BM."}{"Selective removal of heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions by sulfide-selector intercalated layered double hydroxide adsorbent ": "Remaining largely under-appreciated, a majority of metal ion sorbents are limited in their target selectivity. In this work, a 3D sulfide intercalated NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NFL-S) hierarchical sorbent has been synthesized for selective heavy metal removal. The intercalation of sulfurated groups in the interlayer of the layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets endows NFL-S as a selective heavy metal ion filter; the selectivity of NFL-S for heavy metals is in the order of Pb2+ > Cu2+ \u2265 Zn2+ > Cd2+> Mn2+, and NFL-S has high kd values for Pb2+ (\u223c106 mL/g) and Cu2+ (\u223c105 mL/g). Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction were used to analyze the composition of the as-prepared nanoadsorbent. The selective adsorption behavior was systematically studied using batch experiments, and the performance was evaluated through kinetic and isotherm studies. Moreover, the adsorption mechanism of heavy metals by NFL-S through surface complexation was also investigated, which shows great potential for water decontamination."}{"Mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of selective laser melted 316L stainless steel after different heat treatment processes ": "Irregular grains, high interfacial stresses and anisotropic properties widely exist in 3D-printed metallic materials, and this paper investigated the effects of heat treatment on the microstructural, mechanical and corrosion properties of 316\u2009L stainless steel fabricated by selective laser melting. Sub-grains and low-angle boundaries exist in the as-received selective laser melted (SLMed) 316\u2009L stainless steel. After heat treatment at 1050\u2009\u00b0C, the sub-grains and low-angle boundaries changed slightly, and the stress state and strength decreased to some extent due to the decrease of dislocation density. After heat treatment at 1200\u2009\u00b0C, the grains became uniform, and the dislocation cells vanished, which led to a sharp decline in the hardness and strength. However, the ductility was improved after recrystallization heat treatment. The passive film thickness and corrosion potential of the SLMed 316\u2009L stainless steel decreased after heat treatment, and the pitting potential also decreased due to the accelerated transition from metastable to steady-state pitting; this accelerated transition was caused by the presence of weak passive films at the enlarged pores after heat treatment, especially for an adequate solid solution treatment."}{"Selective laser melting of NiTi alloy with superior tensile property and shape memory effect ": "It is a challenge to develop complex-shaped NiTi shape memory alloy parts by traditional processing methods, due to the poor machinability of NiTi alloy. It is reported that selective laser melting (SLM) of additive manufacturing could overcome this problem. However, the reported SLM-produced NiTi exhibits poor tensile ductility due to the inner defects and adverse unidirectional columnar grains from SLM process. In this work, the defect-less SLM-NiTi with nondirective columnar grains was fabricated by optimizing the intraformational laser scanning length and interformational laser scanning direction. The obtained lath-shaped SLM-NiTi sample exhibits tensile strain of 15.6%, more than twice of the reported maximum result (\u02dc7%). Besides, the SLM-NiTi part with complex geometry displays a shape memory recovery of 99% under compressive deformation of 50%."}{"Optimization of annealing treatment and comprehensive properties of Cu-containing Ti6Al4V-xCu alloys ": "The Ti6Al4V-Cu alloy was reported to show good antibacterial properties, which was promising to reduce the hazard of the bacterial infection problem. For the purpose of preparing Ti6Al4V-Cu alloy with satisfied comprehensive properties, it\u2019s important to study the heat treatment and the appropriate Cu content of the alloy. In this study, high Cu content Ti6Al4V-xCu (x\u202f=\u202f4.5, 6, 7.5\u202fwt%) alloys were prepared, and firstly the annealing heat treatments were optimized in the \u03b1+\u03b2+Ti2Cu triple phase region to obtain satisfied tensile mechanical properties. Then the effect of Cu content on the tribological property, corrosion resistance, antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of the Ti6Al4V-xCu alloys were systematically studied to obtain the appropriate Cu content. The results showed that the optimal annealing temperatures for Ti6Al4V-xCu (x\u202f=\u202f4.5, 6, 7.5\u202fwt%) alloys were 720, 740 and 760\u202f\u00b0C, respectively, which was resulted from the proper volume fractions of \u03b1, \u03b2 and Ti2Cu phases in the microstructure. The additions of 4.5\u202fwt% and 6\u202fwt% Cu into the medical Ti6Al4V alloy could enhance the wear resistance and corrosion resistance of the alloy, but the addition of 7.5\u202fwt% Cu showed an opposite effect. With the increase of the Cu content, the antibacterial property was enhanced due to the increased volume fraction of Ti2Cu phase in the microstructure, but when the Cu content was increased to 7.5\u202fwt%, cytotoxicity was presented. A medium Cu content of 6\u202fwt%, with annealing temperature of 740\u202f\u00b0C make the alloy possesses the best comprehensive properties of tensile properties, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, antibacterial property and biocompatibility, which is promising for future medical applications."}{"Hot deformation characterization of as-homogenized Al-Cu-Li X2A66 alloy through processing maps and microstructural evolution ": "Uniaxial compression tests were carried out on an Al-Cu-Li alloy at a temperature range of 300\u2013500\u00b0C and a strain rate range of 0.001\u201310 s\u22121. Four representative instability maps based on Gegel, Alexander-Malas (A-M), Kumar-Prasad (K-P) and Murty-Rao (M-R) criteria were constructed. Through formula deduction and microstructural observation, it can be concluded that M-R criterion is more accurate than K-P criterion, and the first two criteria are better than Gegel and A-M criteria. From a power dissipation map and a M-R instability map, the optimized processing parameters are 480\u2013500\u00b0C/0.001\u20130.1 s\u22121 and 420\u2013480\u00b0C/0.1-1 s\u22121. The corresponding microstructural analysis shows that dynamic recovery and partial dynamic recrystallization are main dynamic softening mechanisms. Transmission electron microscopy observation indicated that a large number of primary coarse T1 (Al2CuLi) particles precipitated in the homogenized specimen. After deformation at 500\u00b0C, most of the primary T1 particles dissolved back into the matrix, and secondary fine T1 particles precipitated at deformation-induced dislocations, high angle grain boundaries and other dispersed particles."}{"Texture control by {10-12} twinning to improve the formability of Mg alloys: A review ": "Texture control of wrought Mg alloys, particularly in rolled Mg alloy sheets, has been an important research topic for the past several decades because it has significant influence on stretch formability at room temperature. For Mg alloys, {10-12} twinning can be easily activated and causes a \u02dc86.3\u00b0 lattice rotation. Thus, pre-twinning deformation is considered as an effective and low-cost method for texture control in wrought Mg and its alloys. Furthermore, it has been verified that texture control via pre-twinning deformation can remarkably improve stretch formability of rolled Mg alloy sheets. In this review, recent researches on texture control via twinning deformation and its influence on stretch formability will be critically reviewed. The main contents include the micro-mechanism and impact factors of control in twin-orientation, plastic processing techniques of pre-inducing twins and the application of pre-induced twins in improvement of stretch formability. Finally, further research directions on this field were proposed."}{"Recent advances in perovskite oxides for anion-intercalation supercapacitor: A review ": "Recently, perovskites have been widely studied as functional materials. Significant attention was paid to the perovskites as an anode material for supercapacitor when the charge storage mechanism of the oxygen-anion-intercalation was proposed. This review summarized the anion-intercalation mechanism and the factors which impact the electrochemical performance of electrodes by researching previous studies on perovskite materials for supercapacitors. Moreover, the issues and the focus of the previous studies have also been discussed herein. The guidelines for the design of perovskite material for supercapacitor were also presented, which is beneficial to the further study of perovskite materials for supercapacitors."}{"Synthesis of BiVO4 quantum dots/reduced graphene oxide composites for CO2 reduction ": "As a commonly used photocatalyst for oxygen evolution, monoclinic BiVO4 is rarely exploited in CO2 reduction due to its low conduction band. In this work, BiVO4 quantum dots with size of ~4.5\u202fnm were synthesized through a sodium oleate modified hydrothermal process. The quantum dots show enhanced photocatalytic activity in converting CO2 to CO or CH4 compared with that in bulk. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to their evaluated conduction band when the material size reduces to nanoscale. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity can be further improved by combing with reduced graphene oxide. The reduced graphene oxide serves as a superior electron collector and transporter. Our results show a significantly improved photocatalytic activity (3.5 times) in CO2 reduction. This work would provide a feasible strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity of catalysts by using quantum structures, especially some catalysts which have a lower conduction band."}{"Facile construction of Co3O4 porous microspheres with enhanced acetone gas sensing performances ": "Large-scale and well-dispersed Co3O4 porous microspheres have been successfully synthesized by a room temperature solution approach followed by the calcination treatment in air. Microstructural characterizations by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) show that as-prepared Co3O4 microspheres with diameters of 800\u2013950\u202fnm are assembled by numerous nanoparticles and present loose porous architectures. When applied as a gas sensing material, Co3O4 porous microsphere based sensor exhibits more rapid response/recovery speed (2\u202fs/5\u202fs) and higher sensitivity towards acetone gas at 180\u202f\u00b0C compared with ethanol, toluene, formaldehyde, ammonia and benzene gas. Meanwhile, Co3O4 microsphere-based sensors also show superior stability and reproducibility towards acetone gas. The high catalytic activity of Co3O4 specimen and stable and penetrable sensing networks constructed by three dimensional sphere-like loose architectures promote target gas adsorption/desorption, facilitate surface chemical reaction and accelerate electron transfer, thus enormously improving gas sensing dynamics."}{"Glass-assisted CVD growth of large-area MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2 monolayers on Si/SiO2 substrate ": "In the last few years, there has been much effort to overcome the challenge of growing large-area transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers with a high-coverage to allow for their wide-usage in practical devices and applications. In this study, we investigate effects of two different glass lamellas on the formation of different monolayer TMDCs, namely MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2 for the CVD process in a horizontal growth configuration. Our approach is different from the widely used techniques of placing the substrate on the top the precursors (face-down configuration, generally causing non-uniform growth) or growing monolayers directly on glass lamellas which generally requires transfer step of the flakes if relevant devices will be fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrates. We confirm that rather than the glass surface effect, the glass lamellas ingredients enable the formation of monolayer TMDCs. Moreover, the repeatability problem of growing large-size monolayer flakes with uniform distribution and high coverage is successfully surpassed. For a comparison of ingredient compositions, two different glass lamellas (Glass-1 and 2) are used where the amount of Na and other ingredients are different. Our results show that although the uniformity and flake sizes change with the composition of the glass lamellas, MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2 monolayer flakes have been grown successfully for both of the glass lamella types. Thus, the catalytic effect of using a glass lamella in the CVD process is verified for three different TMDCs. Our monolayer TMDCs also show long-term stability where no-crack formation is observed since their initial growth, which is more than a year."}{"Impact of micro-texturization on hybrid micro/nano-textured surface for enhanced broadband light absorption in crystalline silicon for application in photovoltaics ": "This paper reports investigation on hybrid micro/nanotextures for enhanced broadband absorption in crystalline silicon(c-Si) for application in photovoltaics. Microscale pyramids are fabricated using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, etched at different durations. Nanowires on pyramids are formed using metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE). With 30\u202fmin of NaOH etching, pyramids with 3\u20135\u202f\u03bcm heights (3\u20137\u202f\u03bcm widths) are formed. The pyramids reduce broadband reflection of the c-Si through enhanced scattering. After MACE, nanowires with 450\u2013600\u202fnm heights (30\u201340\u202fnm widths) are obtained. With the nanowires, weighted average reflection (WAR) for all samples reduces significantly, owing to enhanced light coupling by the nanowires and increased light scattering by the pyramids. The sample with 30\u202fmin NaOH etching and MACE demonstrates WAR of 7.5%, which is the lowest broadband reflection achieved in this work. This corresponds to potential Jsc(max) of 38.7 mA/cm2, or 13.5% enhancement compared to the Jsc(max) of the pyramids alone."}{"Synthesis of ZnO/NiO nanocomposites for the rapid detection of ammonia at room temperature ": "This paper presents the facile synthesis of pure ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and ZnO/NiO nanocomposites (NCs) and their ammonia sensing properties. The synthesis of ZnO/NiO NCs was done via a simple two-step process (co-precipitation followed by sol-gel method). Structural analysis of the prepared samples revealed the existence of hexagonal wurtzite structured ZnO and face center cubic structured NiO in ZnO/NiO sample. Surface morphological studies of the fabricated sensors show the porous nature, which further helps in enhanced sensing response. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) results of ZnO/NiO NCs revealed the valence states of Ni (+2) and Zn (+2). Superior gas sensing response of the ZnO/NiO sensor towards ammonia at room temperature was observed from the gas sensing studies. The response of ZnO/NiO (~1208) was nearly 80 times higher than pristine ZnO (~15) towards 100\u00a0ppm ammonia at room temperature. Low detection limit was obtained for ZnO/NiO sensor (8.27\u20131\u00a0ppm ammonia). The response and recovery times of ZnO/NiO were 5\u00a0s and 8\u00a0s respectively. The p-n junction formed between p-NiO and n-ZnO, and chemical sensitization and catalytic activity of the NiO contributed to the enhanced sensing performance of NiO/ZnO sensor."}{"Ultra-thin wafer technology and applications: A review ": "Ultra-thin wafers with thickness of typically less than 200\u202f\u03bcm are important building blocks in semiconductor device manufacturing. Due to the special mechanical properties of ultra-thin wafers, the fabrication and handling of ultra-thin wafers are substantially different from traditional ones. Thus, the progresses of ultra-thin wafer technology from manufacturing process to wafer transportation and device application are reviewed herein. The combination of mechanical grinding and stress relief through polishing or etching has become the standard wafer thinning process. Owing to the rising of TAIKO wafers, special equipments and carriers have the potential to be eliminated in ultra-thin wafer handling. Ultra-thin wafer has broad applications in semiconductor device fabrication and would have long-term impact on semiconductor industrial."}{"Construction of g-C3N4/ZIF-67 photocatalyst with enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity ": "The g-C3N4/ZIF-67 composite has been prepared by encapsulation of ZIF-67 with g-C3N4. The composition of the material and the internal atomic or molecular structure were characterized by XRD and FT-IR. The morphology of the samples was observed by TEM and SEM. In addition, the samples were characterized by UV\u2013vis DRS, PL and N2 adsorption-desorption. Compared with bulk g-C3N4, ethanol production has increased about 3 times. The yield of ethanol decreases by about 6% after 5 cycles, which displayed cycling stability. The enhanced photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction was attributed to the synergistic effect of g-C3N4 and ZIF-67, which increases the separation of electrons and holes."}{"Advances in chemiresistive sensors for acetone gas detection ": "Detection of acetone gas embraces a broad range of purposes. It encompasses medical application for healthcare, serving as an alternative for conventional diagnosis of diabetes as well as aiding in environmental monitoring. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of recent development for chemiresistive acetone gas sensors is essential to ensure rapid progression is upheld in the future. The objectives of this review are to assess state-of-the-art of chemiresistive sensors for acetone gas detection and to identify factors affecting performance of the sensors which could bring about sensing developments. For these purposes, sensing characteristics entailing limit of detection, response and recovery time, stability as well as factors affecting sensing mechanisms are discussed thoroughly in the paper. This review informs readers about deficiencies that majority of gas sensors are still facing to date. Recognizing the shortcomings would encourage improvements on detection of acetone gas in the future."}{"Solution-based flexible indium oxide thin-film transistors with high mobility and stability by selective surface modification ": "Improved performances of solution-based flexible indium oxide (In2O3) thin-film transistors (TFTs) was achieved by introducing clear-cut edges of the active areas on substrate surfaces. Patterned areas for the In2O3 active regions were converted to hydrophilic by oxygen plasma treatment whereas the remaining areas between the active region patterns were converted to hydrophobic by transferring oligomer molecules from a partially cured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mask. This way, In2O3 precursor could be settled only on the intended patterns for the active regions and therefore the active regions were formed with distinct edges and regular shapes. A model TFT prepared via this method exhibited significantly improved performances over a reference device prepared without the selective surface treatment in terms of threshold voltage (V\n                     th), subthreshold swing (SS), saturation mobility (\u03bc\n                     sat), off-state current (I\n                     off), and bias-stress stability. Furthermore, the TFT exhibited good electrical stability under a bias stress and sustainable mechanical stability even at 10,000 cycles of bending tests at a radius of curvature of 5\u202fmm. Such improvements were attributed to decreased trap state density at the channel/dielectric interface due to clear distinction of the active region edges and good interface properties, which also helped improving the mechanical stability under prolonged cyclic bending."}{"Acetone sensor based on WO3 nanocrystallines with oxygen defects for low concentration detection ": "In this work, the monoclinic and hexagonal phase of WO3 nanocrystallines are prepared by a facile one-pot microwave assisted hydrothermal method. The obtained WO3 are fabricated as gas sensors to detect acetone vapor. The microstructure and sensing performances of different WO3 phases are studied comparatively. The results show that the precursor pH value affects precipitation of H2WO4 and subsequently decomposition of H2WO4 to WO3. Hydrochloric acid plays very important role both in adjusting pH and modulating WO3 morphology. The monoclinic WO3 with oxygen vacancy exhibits outstanding high sensitivity and fast response to a wide concentration range of acetone (0.25\u202fppm\u2013100\u202fppm). The response value reaches 3.8\u2013250\u202fppb, and 31\u2013100\u202fppm respectively, at optimal working temperature of 320\u202f\u00b0C. The detection limit is estimated as low as 7.5\u202fppb. The excellent sensing performance of the monoclinic WO3 is attributed to the lattice oxygen defects which facilitate acetone adsorption on the material surface. Furthermore, the strong dipole moment interactions between monoclinic WO3 and acetone molecules help enhancing the selectivity."}{"Novel and stable Fe-BiVO4 nanocatalyst by efficient dual process in the ciprofloxacin degradation ": "Novel Fe-impregnated BiVO4 was synthetized by a sonochemistry method, then the Fe-impregnation was prepared through an easy and low-cost method by the directly hydrolyzes iron salt onto BiVO4 nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer analysis indicated the presence of Fe on the impregnated BiVO4. Half-time of Fe-BiVO4 (1%) sample was 10 times greater than BiVO4 pure in the ciprofloxacin degradation by a dual effect process under UV-Vis light irradiation. The dual process synergy was achieved by 55% with respect to photocatalysis, being the predominant process in the degradation by the holes photogenerated corroborating the oxidizing species scavenger's experiments. Novel Fe-BiVO4 samples can degrade the ciprofloxacin by the dual effect process (photocatalysis and photo-Fenton), which inhibited the electron-hole pairs recombination. 1Fe-BiVO4 photocatalyst was stable and active after six cycles without presence of photocorrosion. This catalyst may offer a sustainable treatment to decontaminate wastewater."}{"The NiO electrode materials in electrochemical capacitor: A review ": "In recent years, nickel oxide has attracted much attention for the supercapacitor application because of the advantages of low toxicity, cheapness and environment friendliness. This review focuses on the performance of nickel oxide and its composites in supercapacitors and their synthesizing strategies. It is concluded that the supercapacitor performance depends on morphologies, surface area, particle size, porosity and crystallinity of nickel oxide materials. Their three-dimensional morphology with porous structures usually presents higher specific capacitance. Compared with pure NiO nanocrystals, NiO-based composites often show higher specific capacitance resulting from the synergetic effects between the components. Furthermore, the strategies for preparing NiO-based materials including hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, electrospinning technique and microwave-assisted method, and the factors affecting their electrochemical performance have also been summarized."}{"Enhancement of sensitivity and selectivity of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanorod gas sensors by ZnO nanoparticles decoration ": "The iron oxide nanorods synthesized and decorated with zinc oxide nanoparticles by using hydrothermal method. Spray pyrolysis method was applied to deposit thin films. The morphology and structure of the samples investigated by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The samples were exposed to the vicinity of several toxic gases/alcoholic vapors in the temperature range of 50\u2013300\u202f\u00b0C and their electrical responses were collected. Approximately 59% response enhancement was achieved for ZnO-decorated \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanorod samples along with faster response-rate compared to the pure \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanorods. Results from this study also showed that the decorated ZnO on the \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanorods exhibited higher sensitivity to H2S gas relative to the other gaseous mixture constituents obtained at 200\u202f\u00b0C. After exposing the sensor to the target gas molecules, the resistivity decreased compared to the pure \u03b1-Fe2O3 and ZnO sensor likely due to the existence of various depletion layers on the surface."}{"Inverse spinel NiFe2O4 deposited g-C3N4 nanosheet for enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity ": "The highly photocatalytic active magnetic NiFe2O4 deposited g-C3N4 hetero-structured nanocomposite was prepared by facile sol-gel followed calcination method. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) result showed that the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles are deposited on g-C3N4 nanosheet. The High resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) analysis confirms the heterojunction between the NiFe2O4 and g-C3N4 nanoparticles. Compared with pure NiFe2O4 and pristine g-C3N4, the as prepared nanocomposite exhibits significantly higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency on methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (Rh B) dye in presence of visible light and direct sunlight irradiation. The magnetic nanocomposite NiFe2O4-g-C3N4 attains the maximum degradation efficiency of 99% under direct sunlight for both MB (20\u202fmg/L) and Rh B (10\u202fmg/L) dyes, which is quite higher than the efficiency obtained from the visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite attributed to the highly suppressed charge carriers recombination, better visible light absorption capability and the synergistic effect due to the heterojunction between NiFe2O4 and g-C3N4. From the radical trapping experiment it was observed that, the superoxide (O2\n                     \u2212) and hydroxyl (OH*) are the main active species for photocatalytic degradation process."}{"Role of hexamethylenetetramine in ZnO-cellulose nanocomposite enabled UV and humidity sensor ": "Spherical nanoparticles and short nanorods of ZnO nanocrystals were grown on cellulose fibers by a simple one pot aqueous chemical bath deposition technique using hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as the surfactant. The role of surfactant on UV and humidity sensing properties of ZnO-cellulose nanocomposite (ZCN) has been investigated. The structure, morphology and composition of the ZCNs were investigated by X-rays diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. The morphology, shape and size of the ZCN were analyzed by a transmission electron microscopy. The optical properties were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The band gap values of the composites, obtained from DRS, were in the range of 3.22\u20133.24\u202feV. The ZCN synthesized with 0.9\u202fwt% of HMT showed a very high response to ultraviolet (UV) light, characterized by a large increase in the photocurrent under UV illumination. Due to UV illumination, the surface photocurrent recorded from a pellet of the above nanocomposite powder increased from 7.416\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127 A to 3.161\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22125 A in 8\u202fs. The ON to OFF ratio of the photocurrent (I\n                     UV/I\n                     Dark) was 42.624, whereas the response and recovery times were 8\u202fs and 10\u202fs, respectively. The humidity sensing properties of the nanocomposite powder were studied in the relative humidity (RH) range 40\u201390% and a sensitivity of 4.487\u202fM\u03a9/%RH was recorded for the powder synthesized at optimized condition. The high ON/OFF ratio, short response and recovery time imply the importance of the material as a good UV sensor, whilst the notable sensitivity of the material promises for efficient humidity sensing applications."}{"Detection of Zn in water using novel functionalised planar microwave sensors ": "Metal pollution in aquatic environments has attracted global attention. Current methods are not able to monitor water quality in-situ at low-cost. This paper reports on a novel approach for detecting changes in the concentration of zinc in water using electrical and a microwave sensor method, adopting two planar sensors: one was functionalised with a screen-printed \u03b2-Bi2O3 based coating, while the other was uncoated. Results show that both electrical and the microwave sensor responses were dependent on the presence and concentration of Zn in water with R2\u202f=\u202f0.93\u20130.99. The functionalised sensor with a 60\u202f\u03bcm thick \u03b2-Bi2O3 based film offers improved performance compared with both uncoated and functionalised sensors with 40\u202f\u00b5m thick coating for detecting the changes of Zn concentrations in water for low levels (100 and 500\u202f\u00b5g/L). This novel sensing system could be a cost-effective alternative to the current offline methods."}{"Enhanced tensile strength and thermal conductivity of natural rubber graphene composite properties via rubber-graphene interaction ": "Rubber-filler interaction is one of the important factors that determine final properties of a composite materials. However, the process of making a homogeneous and stable dispersion of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or graphene in the natural rubber latex matrix remains a major challenge. In this study, graphene oxide (GO) was reduced in-situ during the latex mixing in the absence of strong reducing agent. The composite with only 0.1\u202fphr of rGO has successfully improved the stress elongation at 700% (M700) and retention up to 14% and 13%, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have suggested that these improvements were attributed to rubber-filler interactions between rGO and rubber particles. It is interesting to observe that the thermal conductivity has also increased to 0.236\u202fW/m\u00b7K or a 36% of increment after addition of rGO."}{"Sol-gel auto combustion synthesis and characterizations of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles: Different fuels approach ": "The spinel structured cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by sol-gel auto combustion method using three different fuels (Ethylene glycol, Glycine and Urea) approach. Pure phase formation of cobalt ferrite with cubic spinel structure was observed for all the samples in X-ray diffraction patterns. The average crystallite size, lattice parameter and other structural parameters were calculated from XRD data. The lower value of average particle size of 15\u202fnm was noticed with urea as fuel. The sponge-like spherical shaped morphology was observed irrespective of the fuels. The average grain size was found to be in the range of 65\u201386\u202fnm. The enhanced saturation magnetization, coercivity and other magnetic parameters obtained by M-H plots confirmed the superparamagnetic behaviour of the samples. It is observed from experimental results that using urea as a fuel one can obtain smaller particle size while the improved magnetic properties were observed for ethylene glycol as a fuel."}{"Development of Ni doped ZnO/polyaniline nanocomposites as high response room temperature NO2 sensor ": "Hybrid sensors consisting of semiconducting metal oxides and conducting polymers have immense capability of sensing various poisonous gases and chemical warfare agents at room temperature. The hybrid sensor has tunable properties, which leads to high sensing response with lower detection limits. In the present work, Ni doped ZnO nanorods were synthesized using a wet chemical synthesis and their nanocomposite with polyaniline was prepared using in-situ oxidative polymerization technique. The structure, morphology and surface composition properties were studied using XRD, FTIR, XPS and FESEM. Response of the nanocomposites towards various oxidizing and reducing gases was studied and was found to be more selective towards NO2. Amount of doping for maximum sensor response was optimized and it was found that with 10\u202fmol% Ni doping, sensor response of 75% was obtained towards 100\u202fppm with response time of 82\u202fs and recovery time of 399\u202fs. Further, recovery time reduced significantly from 1096\u202fs (ZnO/PANi) to 399\u202fs (Ni@ZnO/PANi). This hybrid sensor shows better sensitivity, selectivity, and higher response compared to pure PANi and ZnO/PANi nanocomposites. Doping of Ni over ZnO nanorods leads to higher surface area, maximum adsorption of gases resulting into a very effective NO2 gas sensor at room temperature."}{"Creep properties of single crystal Ni-base superalloys (SX): A comparison between conventionally cast and additive manufactured CMSX-4 materials ": "The present work compares the microstructures and the creep properties of two types of single crystal Ni-base superalloy CMSX-4 materials (SXs). One was produced by conventional directional solidification Bridgman processing. The other was manufactured by selective electron beam melting (SEBM). The microstructures of the two types of materials are compared with emphasis placed on the large (dendritic/interdendritic regions) and small scale (\u03b3-matrix/\u03b3\u2032-precipitates) microstructural heterogeneities, which characterize SX microstructures and their evolution during processing, heat treatment and creep. It is shown that heat treated SEBM materials have creep properties, which match or even outperform those of conventionally processed SX materials. Creep properties were assessed using a miniature creep test technique where [001] miniature tensile creep specimens were tested in the high temperature/low stress (1050\u202f\u00b0C, 160\u202fMPa) and in the low temperature/high stress (850\u202f\u00b0C, 600\u202fMPa) creep regimes. The creep behavior is interpreted based on microstructural results, which were obtained using analytical scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM)."}{"Additive manufacturing of functionally graded materials: A review ": "Functionally graded materials (FGMs) represent a class of novel materials in which compositions/constituents and/or microstructures gradually change along single or multiple spatial directions, resulting in a gradual change in properties and functions which can be tailored for enhanced performance. FGMs can be fabricated using a variety of well-established processing methods; however, it is also known that there are inherent drawbacks to existing synthesis methods. As an emerging technology that provides a high degree of control over spatial resolution, additive manufacturing (AM) provides an intriguing pathway to circumvent the drawbacks of currently available methods. AM involves the selective deposition of individual layers of single or multiple materials, and as such it offers the potential of local control of composition and microstructure in multiple dimensions; such process conditions, in principle, can be tailored to construct complex FGMs with multi-dimensional and directional gradient structures. In this review paper, our current understanding of important issues, such as modeling, processing, microstructures and mechanical properties, as related to FGMs produced via AM, are described and discussed in an effort to assess the state of the art in this field as well as to provide insight into future research directions."}{"Effects of alloying on deformation twinning in high entropy alloys ": "In the current work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to model the compressive property of FCC (face centered cubic) Al0.25CoFeNiCu0.75 high entropy alloy (HEA) nanopillars. For comparison the binary, ternary and quaternary derivatives based on Ni\u2013Cu\u2013Fe\u2013Co\u2013Al system along with pure Ni were investigated. The twin nucleation and migration stress, atomic strain and stress and generalized planar faults energy (GPFE) of the compositions were calculated. The simulation results suggest that plastic deformation of all nanopillars is mediated by deformation twinning, but both the yield strength and flow stress decrease with the increase in the number of alloying elements, implying the decrease in the twin nucleation and migration stresses, respectively. The atomic strain and stress, increasing with the addition of alloying elements, provide direct evidences at atomic scale for the severe lattice distortion resulting in the decrease in stacking fault energy (SFE) and twin boundary energy as shown in the GPFE curves. The SFE of Al0.25CoFeNiCu0.75 HEA is 16\n                        \n                           mJ\n                           /\n                           \n                              \n                                 m\n                              \n                              \n                                 2\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     . The twinnability of the studied compositions also increases with the addition of alloying elements, so twinning deformation dominates in the current nanocrystals."}{"The effect of double austenitization and quenching on the microstructure and mechanical properties of CrNiMoWMnV ultrahigh-strength steels after low-temperature tempering ": "With the aim of improving the strength and impact toughness combination of two ultrahigh-strength quenched and tempered steels, the effect of high-temperature austenitization and quenching prior to conventional austenitization, quenching and tempering at 200\u202f\u00b0C has been investigated. The CrNiMoWMnV steels concerned had carbon contents of 0.18 and 0.32\u202fwt% C and tensile strengths 1370 and 1840\u202fMPa. Microstructures were characterized using laser scanning confocal microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy combined with electron back scattering diffraction and X-ray diffraction. Carbide characteristics were studied using transmission electron microscopy on carbon extraction replicas. Mechanical properties were characterized in terms of hardness, tensile and Charpy-V impact testing. The microstructure of the investigated steels after all treatments consisted of tempered martensite with small fractions of precipitates and retained austenite. The volume fraction of retained austenite was increased through the use of the double austenitization and quenching plus tempering route as compared to the conventional quenching and tempering route. Three main precipitate types were observed in all the investigated steels: complex carbides MxCy, aluminium nitride AlN, titanium-vanadium carbonitride (TiV)(CN) and complex AlN precipitates with a core of (TiV)(CN). The size of the largest precipitates was reduced as a result of the double austenitization treatment. In both investigated steels, the energy absorbed and the percentage ductile fracture in the CVN impact test were improved as a result of the extra austenitization and quenching: in the case of the 0.18C steel this was achieved without a loss of hardness or tensile properties, but with the 0.32C steel there was a slight decrease in the hardness and tensile properties."}{"Hardness and strength enhancements of CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy with Nd doping ": "Designing an alloy with both high strength and high ductility is a daunting challenge for structural materials. CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy with FCC structure has been proven to be an ultra-ductile but low-strength alloy. Precipitation hardening is an effective way to solve this problem. However, the precipitation mechanisms are generally complex during the solidification process because of the composition with five or more elements in high-entropy alloys. We reported a designing concept that the liquid phase separation was used to simplify the mechanism of precipitates formation. The doped Nd separated from the matrix and precipitated with Ni and Mn because of the negative mixing enthalpy. Precipitation occurred randomly at grain boundaries and in the interior of grains. Compared to the single-phase FCC matrix, the hardness of HCP precipitates was three times of the matrix. The alloys were strengthened with good ductility and it was demonstrated by uniaxial tension tests."}{"Mechanical performance and microstructural characterisation of titanium alloy-alloy composites built by wire-arc additive manufacture ": "A first stage study has been performed to investigate the potential for exploiting high deposition rate WAAM to print dual-alloy microstructures. Samples were built using alternating feed wires of commercially-pure Ti and Ti\u20136Al\u20134V. A high level of dilution occurred during deposition accompanied by effective liquid-phase mixing, producing a regular distribution of solidified melt tracks of approximate bimodal composition each less extreme than that of their respective constituent feed wires. The yield strength of the dual alloy composite material was approximately midway between that of the two alloys from which it was produced and exhibited a double inflection yield behaviour. Overall, because of the relatively coarse length scale there was not a significant property advantage in tensile loading above that of a chemically homogenous material, thus the main advantage of printing alternate alloys at this length scale is likely to reside more with increasing crack path tortuosity during fracture or fatigue loading. Importantly, the deposited material was found to have a refined \u03b2-grain structure suggesting that the composition gradients introduced by dual-alloy printing can disrupt the epitaxial columnar growth normally seen in WAAM deposits."}{"Evolution of carbon nanotubes and their metallurgical reactions in Al-based composites in response to laser irradiation during selective laser melting ": "Aluminium-based composites reinforced with carbon nanotubes are widely sought for their outstanding metallurgical and structural properties that largely depend on the manufacturing route. In this work, the process-structure-property relationship for a composite made from high-energy-ball-milled pure Al and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) processed by laser powder-bed-fusion additive manufacturing was investigated. The strong good bond between MWCNT (high laser absorptivity) and Al (low laser absorptivity) allowed the energy transfer from the former to the latter and maintained the heat for longer allowing for better melt efficiency hence improved processability. The response of MWCNT to laser irradiation and their interfacial reactions with Al were probed in a holistic investigation. X-ray diffraction confirmed the partial transformation of C into Al-carbides in addition to the presence of some nano-crystalline graphitic materials. Microscopy revealed evidence of carbides segregation at the melt pool boundaries as well as migration along the build direction. Raman spectroscopy showed that laser irradiation promoted re-graphitisation in MWCNT, reducing the amount of defects introduced by milling. Two types of Al4C3 formed as a result of the metallurgical reaction between Al and MWCNT. These were needle-like and hexagonal Al4C3 and their mechanisms of formation, direct precipitation and dissolution-precipitation, respectively, were explained in light of the thermal profile experienced by the material during melting and solidification. Large scale electron backscatter diffraction showed that there is no distinctive texture developing during melting and solidification. Micro- and nano-indentation testing showed uniform mechanical properties."}{"Engineering heterogeneous microstructure by severe warm-rolling for enhancing strength-ductility synergy in eutectic high entropy alloys ": "The microstructure and mechanical properties of a (L12+B2) AlCoCrFeNi2.1 eutectic high entropy alloy (EHEA) processed by severe warm-rolling were investigated in the present work. The EHEA was successfully warm-rolled up to 90% reduction in thickness at 400\u202f\u00b0C, 600\u202f\u00b0C and 750\u202f\u00b0C. Considerable differences in the microstructural evolution were identified during warm-rolling at the three temperatures. The L12 phase in the EHEA was disordered due to severe warm-rolling at 400\u202f\u00b0C and 750\u202f\u00b0C, while a predominantly ordered structure was retained in the EHEA warm-rolled at 600\u202f\u00b0C. This anomalous behavior could be adequately explained by the sluggish ordering kinetics at lower deformation temperatures. The EHEA warm-rolled at 750\u202f\u00b0C showed an extremely heterogeneous microstructure featured by retained lamellar regions comprising of B2 and FCC lamellae with dispersed B2 phase inside the FCC, whereas the non-lamellar regions showed a mixture of ultrafine to nanocrystalline disordered FCC, ordered B2 and Cr-rich \u03c3 phases. The non-lamellar regions were scarce and nearly absent in the EHEA 90% warm-rolled at 600\u202f\u00b0C and 400\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. The remarkably heterogeneous microstructure of EHEA warm-rolled at 750\u202f\u00b0C resulted in outstanding strength-ductility combination with tensile strength ~1635\u202fMPa and elongation to failure ~18%. The results indicated tremendous potential for achieving superior mechanical properties in heterogeneous EHEAs processed by severe warm-rolling."}{"Additive manufacturing of fine-grained and dislocation-populated CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy by laser engineered net shaping ": "The equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy is additively manufactured by the laser engineered net shaping (LENSTM) process, and the solidification conditions, phase formation, as-deposited microstructures, and tensile behavior are investigated. The LENSTM-deposited CrMnFeCoNi alloy exhibits a single-phase disordered face centered cubic (FCC) structure, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and rationalized by Scheil's solidification simulation. Furthermore, microstructures at multiple length scales, i.e. columnar grains, solidification substructures, and dislocation substructures, are formed. The tensile deformation process is mainly accommodated by dislocation activities with the assistance of deformation twinning. The tensile yield strength of the LENSTM-deposited CrMnFeCoNi alloy is comparable to that of finer-grained wrought-annealed counterparts, due to the additional initial-dislocation strengthening. However, the uniform tensile elongation, by contrast, is lowered, which is attributed to the increased dynamic dislocation recovery rate and hence the weakened work hardening capability of the LENSTM-deposited CrMnFeCoNi. This study demonstrates the capability of the LENSTM process for manufacturing the CrMnFeCoNi alloy, with high performance, for engineering applications."}{"Strengthening of Mg-based long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) phase with deformation kink bands ": "The mechanical properties of the Mg-based LPSO-phase are expected to be strongly affected by the microstructure due to its anisotropic crystal structure. However, the fine details have not been sufficiently understood yet. This study first clarified the detailed microstructural factors that govern the strength of the LPSO-phase by examining alloys with microstructures that were significantly varied via directional solidification and extrusion processes. Refining the microstructure is significantly effective for strengthening LPSO-phase alloys. The yield stress of LPSO-phase alloys with random texture was previously reported to be increased by reducing the \u201clength\u201d of plate-like LPSO-phase grains. In addition, it was found in this study that the formation stress in the deformation kink band, which is a unique deformation mode in an LPSO-phase alloy, can be increased by decreasing the \u201cthickness\u201d of the grains. Furthermore, the study used directionally solidified crystals provided direct evidence that the introduction of the deformation kink band effectively increases the yield stress and work-hardening rate of alloys by hindering the motion of basal dislocations. This \u201ckink-band strengthening\u201d was found to have considerable temperature dependence. The strengthening is significant at or below 200\u202f\u00b0C, but the effect gradually decreases above 300\u202f\u00b0C and is accompanied by the operation of non-basal slip. The results quantitatively clarified that kink-band strengthening is one predominant reason why the LPSO-phase extruded alloy exhibits an unusually high yield stress at any loading orientation."}{"Review on titanium and titanium based alloys as biomaterials for orthopaedic applications ": "Variety of implant materials have been employed in various disciplines of medical science depending on the requirement of a particular application. Metals, alloys, ceramics, and polymers are the commonly used biomaterials. The main focus of this study is to review the various structural and microstructural properties of titanium and titanium based alloys used as orthopaedic implants. Orthopaedic implants need to possess certain important qualities to ensure their safe and effective use.

Various attempts to improve upon these properties like different processing routes, surface modifications have also been inculcated in the paper to provide an insight into the extent of research and effort that has been put into developing a highly superior titanium orthopaedic implant."}{"3D printing of mesoporous bioactive glass/silk fibroin composite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering ": "The fabrication of bone tissue engineering scaffolds with high osteogenic ability and favorable mechanical properties is of huge interest. In this study, a silk fibroin (SF) solution of 30\u202fwt% was extracted from cocoons and combined with mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) to fabricate MBG/SF composite scaffolds by 3D printing. The porosity, compressive strength, degradation and apatite forming ability were evaluated. The results illustrated that MBG/SF scaffolds had superior compressive strength (ca. 20\u202fMPa) and good biocompatibility, and stimulated bone formation ability compared to mesoporous bioactive glass/polycaprolactone (MBG/PCL) scaffolds. We subcutaneously transplanted hBMSCs-loaded MBG/SF and MBG/PCL scaffolds into the back of nude mice to evaluate heterotopic bone formation assay in vivo, and the results revealed that the gene expression levels of common osteogenic biomarkers on MBG/SF scaffolds were significantly better than MBG/PCL scaffolds. These results showed that 3D-printed MBG/SF composite scaffolds are great promising for bone tissue engineering."}{"Advances in additive manufacturing for bone tissue engineering scaffolds ": "This article reviews the current state of the art of additive manufacturing techniques for the production of bone tissue engineering (BTE) scaffolds.

The development of more physiologically relevant 3D cell models capable of emulating the native ECM is of paramount importance for the study of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Due to its structural similarity with hyaluronic acid, a primary component of brain ECM, alginate is a potential biomaterial for 3D cell culture systems. However, a lack of cell adhesion motifs within the chemical structure of alginate has limited its application in neural culture systems. This study presents a simple and accessible method of incorporating collagen fibrils into an alginate hydrogel by physical mixing and controlled gelation under physiological conditions and tests the hypothesis that such a substrate could influence the behaviour of human neurons in 3D culture. Regulation of the gelation process enabled the penetration of collagen fibrils throughout the hydrogel structure as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. Encapsulated human iPSC-derived neurons adhered to the blended hydrogel as evidenced by the increased expression of \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b21 integrins. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that encapsulated neurons formed complex neural networks and matured into branched neurons expressing synaptophysin, a key protein involved in neurotransmission, along the neurites. Mechanical tuning of the hydrogel stiffness by modulation of the alginate ionic crosslinker concentration also influenced neuron-specific gene expression. In conclusion, we have shown that by tuning the physicochemical properties of the alginate/collagen blend it is possible to create different ECM-like microenvironments where complex mechanisms underpinning the growth and development of human neurons can be simulated and systematically investigated."}{"Graphene and its derivatives: Opportunities and challenges in dentistry ": "The emerging science of graphene-based engineered nanomaterials as either nanomedicines or dental materials in dentistry is growing.

Among them, polymers able to respond to environmental stimuli have been recently under growing consideration to impart a \u201csmart\u201d behavior to the final product, which is highly desirable to provide it with a specific dynamic and an advanced function. In particular, thermo-responsive polymers, materials able to undergo a discontinuous phase transition or morphological change in response to a temperature variation, are among the most studied. The development of the so-called controlled radical polymerization techniques has paved the way to a high degree of engineering for the polymer architecture and properties, which in turn brought to a plethora of sophisticated behaviors for these polymers by simply switching the external temperature. These can be exploited in many different fields, from separation to advanced optics and biosensors.

Remarkable advancements in modern material technology have helped the diversity of materials for orthopaedic implant application. As such, nanomaterials can simulate the surface properties of natural tissues, especially with respect to surface topography, surface chemistry, surface energy, and surface wettability. The novel properties of nanomaterials also encourage their use for improving the growth of different tissues. The present review lays the foundation for nanotechnology-driven biomaterials through revelation of fundamental design considerations to determine the performance of an orthopaedic implant in terms of success or failure, their antimicrobial/antibacterial activities, and response to cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. In this context, the nano-functionalization of biomaterial surface has been widely investigated to improve cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and migration for implants with high antimicrobial activity. The potential use of nanomaterials (in terms of nanostructured surface or functional nanocoating over implant surface) can resolve several issues (e.g., corrosion resistance and bacterial adhesion) pertaining to conventional metallic or non-metallic implants, especially for optimization of implant techniques. The future trends of orthopaedic biomaterials (e.g., porous structures, smart biomaterials, and 3D implants) are promising to achieve the desired properties and structure of an implant with stimuli-responsive behaviour. The major challenges in commercialization of nanotechnology-derived biomaterials are finally addressed to help overcome the limitations of pre-existing orthopaedic biomaterials in terms of key variables, e.g., quality, treatment cost, implant life, and pain relief."}{"Delivery of miR-675 by stem cell-derived exosomes encapsulated in silk fibroin hydrogel prevents aging-induced vascular dysfunction in mouse hindlimb ": "Vascular disease is a major complication of aging, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the aging-induced vascular dysfunction remain unclear, and there is no effective treatment to prevent aging induced diseases. The objectives of the present study are to identify the signaling pathway mediating aging-induced vascular dysfunction and to develop an exosome based therapy to inhibit aging process. We used 11-month-old C57BL6 mice as pre-aging animal model and H2O2 treated H9C2 cells as an in vitro aging model to examine the therapeutic effect of miR-675. We found decreased expression of the potential aging modulator miR-675 in aging muscle, and H2O2 treatment decreased the expression of miR-675 and upregulated the expression of the aging marker \u03b2-gal and TGF-\u03b21. We also found that miR-675 mimic decreased \u03b2-gal staining in H2O2 treated H9C2 cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays verified TGF-\u03b21 as the target gene of miR-675. Moreover, senescent H9C2 cells incubated with exosomes isolated from UMSCs transfected with the miR-675 mimic showed increased expression of miR-675, reduced activity of the aging marker \u03b2-gal and reduced protein levels of TGF-\u03b21. We employed silk fibroin hydrogel to encapsulate exosomes in order to prolong the half-life of exosome in vivo. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that exosomes were successfully encapsulated by the hydrogel. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging showed that the miR-675 exosomes encapsulated in silk fibroin hydrogel promote blood perfusion in ischemic hindlimbs. We demonstrated that miR-675 exosomes encapsulated in silk fibroin hydrogel provided sustained release of exosomes in vitro, and increased the retention time of red fluorescent PKH26-exosome in the tissue. Taken together, this study identified miR-675 as an important regulator of cell senescence and provided a novel strategy to deliver powerful exosomes by silk fibroin hydrogel to treat aging-induced vascular dysfunction."}{"Synthesis, optimization and applications of ZnO/polymer nanocomposites ": "Polymer composites have established an excellent position among the technologically essential materials because of their wide range of applications.

In this study, we aimed to enhance the antibacterial activity of SiO2-CaO mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (MBGN) by incorporating silver (Ag) through a surface modification approach. The modified Ag-containing nanoparticles (Ag-MBGN) maintained spherical shape, mesoporous structure, high dispersity, and apatite-forming ability after the surface functionalization. The antibacterial activity of Ag-MBGN was assessed firstly using a planktonic bacteria model. Moreover, a 3D tissue-engineered infected skin model was used for the first time to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Ag-MBGN at the usage dose of 1\u202fmg/mL. In the planktonic bacteria model, Ag-MBGN exhibited a significant antibacterial effect against both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in comparison to non-engineered (Ag-free) MBGN and the blank control. Moreover, Ag-MBGN did not show cytotoxicity towards fibroblasts at the usage dose. However, in the 3D infected skin model, Ag-MBGN only demonstrated antibacterial activity against S. aureus whereas their antibacterial action against P. aeruginosa was inhibited. In conclusion, surface modification by Ag incorporation is a feasible approach to enhance the antibacterial activity of MBGN without significantly impacting their morphology, polydispersity, and apatite-forming ability. The prepared Ag-MBGN are attractive building blocks for the development of 3D antibacterial scaffolds for tissue engineering."}{"Preparation and characterization of PLA/PCL/HA composite scaffolds using indirect 3D printing for bone tissue engineering ": "3D printing-based technologies can fabricate scaffolds offer great precision to control internal architecture and print complicated structures based upon the defect site. However, the materials used in the direct printing are restricted depending on the printing technology used and the indirect one can overcome this limitation. In the present study, indirect 3D printing approach was used to develop bone scaffolds from polylactic acid/ polycaprolactone/ hydroxyapatite (PLA/PCL/HA) composites. Casting of the composite suspensions was done into a dissolvable 3D printed negative mold, in order to achieve simultaneous macro- and micro-porous composites, using freeze drying/particle leaching method. To evaluate morphology, functional groups, and elemental analysis of the scaffolds, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were respectively used. Scaffolds' porosity was measured with the aid of liquid replacement technique. Also, the mechanical strength of scaffolds was examined by compression test and measuring the compressive modulus Considering the microstructure, porosity and pore size as well as mechanical property, the scaffold composed of PLA/PCL 70/30 w/w and 35% HA was more favorable. The PLA/PCL/HA 70/30\u201335% scaffold presented a porosity of 77%, an average pore size of 160\u202f\u03bcm, and Young's modulus of 1.35\u202fMPa.

Owing to their high thermal or electrical conductivity, low viscosity and superior fluidity, liquid metals are emerging as a highly desirable candidate in a broad array of areas, such as flexible electronics, thermal management, soft machines and biomedical materials. However, bulk liquid metal is not readily utilized because of its high surface tension and large dimension-induced dexterity limitations.

Since then the number of papers on these materials has increased exponentially for several reasons amongst them: their hydrophilic nature, excellent electronic conductivities and ease of synthesizing large quantities in water. This unique combination of properties and ease of processing has positioned them as enabling materials for a large, and quite varied, host of applications from energy storage to electromagnetic shielding, transparent conductive electrodes, electrocatalysis, to name a few.

Considering the various elemental composition possibilities, surface functional tunability, various magnetic orders, and large spin\u2013orbit coupling, MXenes can truly be considered as multifunctional materials that can be used to realize highly correlated phenomena. In addition, owing to their large surface area, hydrophilicity, adsorption ability, and high surface reactivity, MXenes have attracted attention for many applications, e.g., catalysts, ion batteries, gas storage media, and sensors. Given the fast progress of MXene-based science and technology, it is timely to update our current knowledge on various properties and possible applications. Since many theoretical predictions remain to be experimentally proven, here we mainly emphasize the physics and chemistry that can be observed in MXenes and discuss how these properties can be tuned or used for different applications."}{"Nanocellulose-based films and their emerging applications ": "Extensive research has been directed towards the reinvention of paper for advanced applications. Nanocellulose-based films, a novel class of specialty paper primarily made of nanocellulose, demonstrate an ideal combination of sustainability and enhanced or novel properties. Enormous efforts have been devoted to enhancing these intrinsic properties and/or creating novel functions to expedite and expand the use of these materials in high-end fields such as touchscreen, solar cells, and nanogenerators. We review state-of-the-art advances in nanocellulose-based films and their utilization in several emerging and promising fields. We begin with an introduction of four types of nanocellulose-based films distinguished by their functional material loads (e.g., synthetic macromolecular polymers, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanomaterials), which involves their manufacturing techniques, structure design, properties, novel functions, and underlying principles. Additionally, we summarize the value-added applications of nanocellulose-based films in flexible electronics, energy converting or harvesting devices, and water treatment. Finally, we provide a critical viewpoint on the remaining challenges and future opportunities in this field."}{"A review of corrosion inhibitors for rust preventative fluids ": "Corrosion of metals has been a widespread issue in industries for centuries. The use of corrosion inhibitors in rust preventative fluids are commonly employed to provide the temporary corrosion protection to metals. The aim of this review is to summarize the rust inhibition properties, inhibition mechanism, chemistry and development of corrosion inhibitors for rust preventative fluids. Some suggestions for further research on corrosion inhibitors have also been discussed."}{"Chemical effects on He bubble superlattice formation in high entropy alloys ": "The probable formation mechanism of He bubble superlattices relies on long range anisotropic diffusion of self-interstitial atoms (SIAs). Here we study He ion irradiation of pure Ni and two equiatomic concentrated solid-solution alloys (CSAs) of FeNi and FeCrNiCo. It is expected from the significantly reduced diffusion of SIAs in CSAs, including high entropy alloys (HEAs), that long range anisotropic SIA migration cannot be active. We report the formation of a He bubble lattice in pure Ni, and for the first time in FeNi and FeCrNiCo systems under 30\u202fkeV He ion irradiation at room temperature. The ion dose and flux required to form a bubble superlattice increase with chemical complexity. Comparing to Ni, SIA clusters change directions more frequently due to anisotropic elementally-biased diffusion from the higher degree of chemical non-homogeneity in CSAs. Nevertheless, anisotropic 1-D diffusion of interstitial defects is possible in these complex alloys over incrementally longer time scales and irradiation doses. The sluggish diffusion, characteristic in CSAs, leads to smaller superlattice parameters and smaller bubble diameters. The chemical biased SIA diffusion and its effects on He evolution revealed here have important implications on understanding and improving radiation tolerance over a wide range of extreme conditions."}{"Recent advances towards applications of molecular bottlebrushes and their conjugates ": "We focus on the most recent developments towards synthesis, modeling, and applications of molecular bottlebrushes. Unique structural characteristics and properties of the bottlebrushes along with an ability to synthetically tailor their structure and functionality open up a number of emergent applications of these polymer systems. The conformation and resulting properties of molecular bottlebrushes and multi-component assemblies encompassing bottlebrushes can be regulated via chemical nature of the backbone and side moieties of bottlebrushes, variation of the distance between grafting points of the side groups, and the degree of polymerization of the side chains. Herein, we highlight the most recent progress in relating the structure of the bottlebrushes with their properties and focus on a number of diverse emerging applications involving bottlebrushes in solvents, melts, and bottlebrushes conjugated with surfaces, interfaces, linear chains, or biomacromolecules. Among such applications are drug delivery and sensing applications, electronic and photonic materials and materials with strain-adaptive stiffening, thermal stabilization and enhancement of activity of enzymes conjugated with copolymer bottlebrushes, and surface modification for biomedical applications."}{"Numerical modeling of annular electromagnetic stirring with intercooling in direct chill casting of 7005 aluminum alloy billet ": "Uniform direct chill (UDC) casting method was developed by combining annular electromagnetic stirring (A-EMS) with intercooling in direct chill casting. In order to investigate effect of UDC on flow patterns, temperature profiles and solidification during the casting, a numerical model of the UDC casting process was developed and used to simulate the UDC casting process for preparing 7005 aluminum alloy billets. The comparison of the calculated results of UDC casting with normal direct chill (NDC) casting indicated that flow patterns, temperature profiles and the sump depth are modified remarkably by the application of annular electromagnetic stirring and intercooling during the direct chill casting. The sump profile and the temperature history during UDC casing were studied, and the mechanism of the casting process were discussed. The comparisons between the simulations and experimental results suggested that the proposed model provides good agreement for the sump profiles and the temperature history within the billets."}{"Microstructure and texture evolution of a near \u03b2 titanium alloy Ti-7333 during continuous cooling hot deformation ": "The microstructure and texture evolution during continuous cooling hot deformation (CCHD) in a near \u03b2 titanium alloy, named Ti-7Mo-3Nb-3Cr-3Al (Ti-7333), were investigated by using the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The results indicate that the precipitation of secondary \u03b1 phase was restricted by CCHD, and the morphology of primary \u03b1 phase nearly had no change with the deformation and temperature drop. In contrast, \u03b2 phase underwent more deformation and the grains tended to refine. This may be due to the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) of \u03b2 phase, including continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX). In addition, the textures of {110} <110>, {225} <520> and {115} <123> transformed to {100} <110> and {001} <100> during CCHD. Among these, the \u019e-fiber component of {001} <100> was the dominant deformation texture in the deformed Ti-7333 alloy. Finally, continuous cooling has an important effect on the work hardening and softening during CCHD, contributing to the different flow behaviors at different cooling rates."}{"Synthesis and graphitization of resole resins by ferrocene ": "Commercial (Rs) and laboratory synthesized resoles (LSRs) containing 3\u20135\u202fwt% ferrocene have been used to study the development of thermosetting resin compositions as binder materials for carbon-containing refractories (CCRs) production. The LSRs were developed based on formaldehyde to phenol 1.5\u202fmol.% (1.5Rs) and 2.0\u202fmol.% (2Rs). Microstructure and oxidation resistance of carbons derived from plain and modified resins have been compared. Chemical structure of the resins was studied using Fourier Transform InfraRed-Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy was used to examine chemical changes during heat treatment of the modified products. Flow behavior of plain and formulated resins has been measured under isothermal condition. Rheology measurement results show that the selected amount of ferrocene did not affect the resin near-Newtonian fluid behavior and processability during refractory production. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) were used to characterize the derived carbon samples after thermal treatment of the resins. The results demonstrate that ferrocene is an excellent additive for crystallizing resoles carbon. The presence of fringes in TEM images indicates the graphitized carbon microstructure. The carbon reactivity in an oxidizing environment was also determined via thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Several factors, such as bond strength and atoms arrangement, have been found to control the carbonized modified-resin oxidation resistance."}{"CoPt-Co hybrid supported on amino modified SiO2 nanospheres as a high performance catalyst for hydrogen generation from ammonia borane ": "CoPt-Co hybrids were successfully supported on amino modified SiO2 nanospheres by a chemical reduction method at a temperature of 278\u202fK. The solid carrier i.e. amino modified SiO2, provides numerous anchoring sites for the metal nanoparticles (NPs) to improve the dispersion while reducing the size of metal NPs. The supported NPs displayed a narrow particle size distribution on the SiO2 surface with an average diameter of 12\u202fnm. The XRD results alongside with the binary alloy phase diagram suggest that the resulted NPs are bimetallic, composed of CoPt and amorphous Co. Among the prepared materials, the solid with the specific composition of SiO2@Pt0.1Co0.9 was proved to be effective catalyst for ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis in aqueous solution.

Furthermore, the SiO2@Pt0.1Co0.9 composite manifested high catalytic activity even after five cycles of reuse."}{"Fusion boundary evolution, precipitation behaviour, and interaction with dislocations in an Fe\u201322Cr\u201315Ni steel weldment during long-term creep ": "A tungsten inert gas welded joint between a novel heat-resistant austenitic steel and ERNiCrCoMo-1 weld metal was investigated before and after creep in this study. The evolution of the microstructures in the base and weld metals was discussed based on the electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. The preferred orientations of the fusion boundary after creep revealed the influence of the applied stress on creep deformation mechanism. A cooperative nucleation process of M23C6 carbides in the base metal was proposed. The finely distributed Cu-rich phase was cut off by the dislocations during creep, leading to increased mean size and reduced amount of the nano-Cu phase. A modified triple-precipitate hardening model was constructed based on TEM observations of the interactions between the particles and the dislocations in the base metal after creep at 200\u202fMPa. The evolution of a \u03bc phase in the weld metal involved epitaxial growth and dissolving into the matrix."}{"Adjustable thermal expansion in La(Fe, Si)13-based conductive composites by high-pressure synthesis ": "Providing a suitable contact interface, where a high conductivity material with a desirable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) adjoins the target micro-electric devices, is very crucial to optimize the properties and service life of the relevant instruments. Regrettably, a high conductivity, low thermal expansion and relatively inexpensive material is very rare. Composites, fortunately, can offer a method to design materials with adjustable properties by mixing two or more diverse constituents. In this paper, high conductivity composites with adjustable thermal expansion were successfully prepared by a high-pressure synthesis. The composites are based on combining La(Fe,Si)13-based compounds, the materials showing a giant, isotropic negative thermal expansion (NTE) properties, within Cu matrix. The La(Fe,Si)13-based compounds were used to adjust the CTE of the composites, while the Cu phase is in charge of tuning the thermal conductivity properties. Thus, by changing the relative amount of the two components, the composites with high conductivities and adjustable CTE were achieved. Furthermore, the thermal expansion and magnetic properties of the composites were investigated by a physical property measurement system. The present results highlight the potential applications of the Cu-based high conductivity composites with room-temperature NTE properties in the thermal contacts to various semiconductor and microelectronic devices."}{"Effect of sintering temperature on phase evolution of Al86Ni6Y4.5Co2La1.5 bulk amorphous composites synthesized via mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering ": "Al86Ni6Y4.5Co2La1.5 amorphous powders were synthesized by mechanical alloying for 200\u202fh. Subsequent consolidation was performed via spark plasma sintering in the temperature range of 250\u202f\u00b0C to 500\u202f\u00b0C at the pressure of 500\u202fMPa. The role of viscous flow on densification was investigated by studying the viscosity change of the amorphous phase at different consolidation temperatures. The decrease in viscosity at higher sintering temperatures resulted in better particle bonding and densification of consolidated samples. The formation of only FCC Al was observed in the consolidated samples at sintering temperatures \u2264\u202f300\u202f\u00b0C and the intermetallic phases formed at temperatures \u2265\u202f400\u202f\u00b0C. The mechanical properties of the bulk samples were measured by Vickers microhardness and nanoindentation tests. The testing results showed that the average values of microhardness, nanohardness and elastic modulus of the sample consolidated at 500\u202f\u00b0C were 3.06\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.14\u202fGPa, 4.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.14\u202fGPa and 89.53\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.25\u202fGPa, respectively. The increase in hardness and elastic modulus of the higher temperature consolidated samples is attributed to the improvement in particle bonding, densification and distribution of various hard intermetallic phases in the amorphous matrix."}{"The effect of Al and Cr elements on the oxidation resistance of MoSi2 via first-principles calculation ": "The properties of structure, energy and oxidation resistance of interstitial and substitutable MoSi2 systems have been investigated using the density functional theory. The calculated lattice constants for pristine MoSi2 confirm the early experimental results. In the interstitial MoSi2, the impurity energy of O atom was computed for the stable interstitial site in the systems. The results reveal that the O atom prefers to occupy the Oct2 site with the lowest impurity energy. In the substitution MoSi2, the Si sites tend to be substituted with Al and Cr atoms, whereas, Mo sites do not behave like the Si sites. The co-substitution of Al/Cr atoms and the direction of the O diffusion in MoSi2 have been analyzed as well. The results from electronic structural analysis indicate that the Si-O bond is the main factor to inhibit the diffusion of O, and the alloying elements of Al and Cr contribute to the oxidation resistance of MoSi2."}{"Effects of Cr and Mo elements on the microstructures and compressive properties of the in situ (TiCxNy\u2013TiB2)/Ni cermets ": "In-situ (TiCxNy\u2013TiB2)/Ni cermets with 70\u202fwt% TiCxNy\u2013TiB2 were successfully fabricated by combustion synthesis and hot pressing sintering in Ni-Ti-B4C-BN powder systems. The microstructures, density, compressive properties, and hardness of the TiCxNy\u2013TiB2/Ni cermets with the addition of 0\u20138\u202fwt% Cr/Mo to the Ni-Ti-B4C-BN powder systems were compared and analysed. The results showed that the ceramic particles distributed uniformly in the cermets, and the size of the ceramic particles reduced with the Cr/Mo addition. Both Cr and Mo addition can improve the hardness, compressive properties, and fracture strains of the cermets. The hardness, compressive strength, and fracture strain of the (TiCxNy\u2013TiB2)/(Ni+Cr) cermets increased from 1561\u202fHV, 2.94\u202fGPa, and 2.9% to 1864\u202fHV, 3.65\u202fGPa, and 3.4%, respectively when the Cr content increased to 5\u202fwt%. The hardness and compressive strength of the (TiCxNy\u2013TiB2)/(Ni+Mo) cermets increased from 1561\u202fHV and 2.94\u202fGPa to 1902\u202fHV and 3.43\u202fGPa, respectively when the Mo content increased to 8\u202fwt%. The cermets with Cr had better compressive properties than the cermets with Mo."}{"Toward a low-cost high-voltage sodium aqueous rechargeable battery ": "Recent discovery of high-concentration electrolyte systems has opened a new avenue toward the high-voltage, safe, and low-cost aqueous rechargeable batteries. However, the need for generally high-cost organic solutes in the high-concentration electrolyte has become another major obstacle. Herein, we revisited all the commonly used low-cost solutes for high-concentration system and discovered that the use of NaClO4 solute effectively results in a wide electrochemical stability window by suppressing water decomposition and induces stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation without involving the reduction of salt anions. The SEI layer, composed of Na2CO3 and NaO compounds including NaOH, guarantees the excellent electrochemical storage stability of the full-cell composed of Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 anode for the extended period of time. This new class of electrolyte systems provides remarkable cycle stability and a coulombic efficiency of \u223c99% at 1C for over 200 cycles, which outperforms the state-of-the-art super-concentrated systems based on NaCF3SO3."}{"State-of-the-art advancements of crystal facet-exposed photocatalysts beyond TiO2: Design and dependent performance for solar energy conversion and environment applications ": "Tailoring semiconductor crystals with optimized reactive facets is considered one of effective strategies to improve photocatalytic activity and selectivity for energy conversion and environmental remediation. The arrangement of surface atom structure through crystal facet engineering could tune surface free energy, electronic band structure, charge transfer and separation, the reactant adsorption and product desorption, and surface redox sites. This progress report aims to concisely highlight recent state-of-the-art progress of crystal facet-dependent performance of promising photocatalysts beyond TiO2. It includes (1) design of crystal-facet exposed photocatalysts with various routes through altering the relative order of the surface energy; (2) crystal facet-based surface junctions to promote the charge transfer and separation; (3) in situ techniques to detection of charge accumulation on crystal-faceted surfaces; (4) exposed face-determined photocatalytic application in water splitting, photoreduction of CO2 into renewable fuels, degradation of organic contaminants from the point of the reactant adsorption and activation. The challenges and prospects for future development are also presented."}{"Injectable biomaterials for translational medicine ": "Injectable therapeutics enabled by engineered biomaterials are becoming increasingly popular, transforming traditional clinical practice to become a minimally invasive and regenerative regime. Compared to preformed biomaterials, injectable biomaterials allow for more precise implantation into deeply enclosed anatomical locations and for the repair of irregularly shaped lesions, demonstrating great translational potential. Continuously emerging clinical needs and advances in materials science have driven an evolution in injectable biomaterials from structural fillers to multifunctional platforms. Integrating disparate functions to design injectable biomaterials for clinical translation remains a considerable challenge, as does the selection of the appropriate design considerations for specific applications. This article aims to review the design and fabrication considerations of injectable biomaterials in the context of medical translation, the engineering strategies used for new materials to meet the growing demands in regenerative and intelligent medicine, and the progress in their development for selected clinical applications. Specifically, three exemplary areas, injectable bone cements, hydrogels, and electronics, all of which demonstrate significant promise in terms of translation and commercialization, are reviewed in detail. In addition, their translational status and future challenges are discussed. It is also envisioned that the mutual collaboration between researchers, clinicians, entrepreneurs, engineers, and patients will inspire and catalyze the innovation and translation of injectable biomaterials."}{"Solid solution strengthening theories of high-entropy alloys ": "We present a review of solid solution strengthening models for random concentrated solid solutions of which high entropy alloys are an interesting subset. High entropy alloys (HEAs) usually refer to a class of multicomponent alloys in equal or near equal concentrations. These complex compositions break the conventional notion of solutes and solvents. Few attempts have been made to extend the conventional solute strengthening models to HEAs. Among these, the model based on an average effective medium, does not include any adjustable parameter, allows all model inputs to be computed by atomistic simulations, and has predicted the strength of fcc HEAs in good agreement with experiments. The basic concepts of this theory is explained and its capabilities are compared with few other existing models for solute strengthening of HEAs."}{"Effect of Sn on microstructure and corrosion behaviors of Al-Mg-Si alloys ": "x wt% (x\u202f=\u202f0, 0.03, 0.40) Sn addition in Al-Mg-Si alloys were prepared to investigate the effect of Sn on the performance of Al-Mg-Si alloys. Optical microscope (OM), scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were applied to observe the microstructure of these alloys. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the phase component among different alloys. Electrochemical polarization measurements and intergranular corrosion test were used to investigate the corrosion behaviors of these alloys. The experimental data shows that 0.03\u202fwt% Sn can slightly enhance mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Al-Mg-Si alloys because of the smaller precipitate free zones (PFZ) area and grain boundary refinement. Higher Sn addition (0.4\u202fwt%) may cause detrimental effect on both mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Al-Mg-Si alloys. Excess Sn tends to replace part of Si in Mg2Si phase and forms Mg2(Si,Sn) phase which is thought to be an anodic phase compared to Al matrix. Electrochemical measurements may not comprehensively reveal the overall corrosion processes, such as de-alloying process of Mg2(Si, Sn) phase and thus enrichment of Sn which leads to much faster dissolution of Al."}{"Analytical electron microscopy of grain boundary segregation: Application to Al-Zn-Mg-Cu (7xxx) alloys ": "Grain boundary segregation is important in many metallurgical phenomenon. A technologically important example is in the performance of high strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu (7xxx) alloys. These alloys can be susceptible to environmentally assisted cracking related to the local microstructure and microchemistry at grain boundaries. In particular, the concentration of alloying elements on grain boundaries relative to the matrix is thought to be important. This paper demonstrates the important effect of the resolution of the electron probe on measurements of grain boundary segregation in these alloys. A convolution model has been applied to demonstrate that a sub-nm probe diameter is necessary to accurately capture the composition profile at grain boundaries. Larger diameter probes will produce profiles that are in significant error, not only in concentrations measured but also in the shape of the profile. These errors arise from both smearing effects and sampling of precipitates. Contradictory reports regarding excess or deficiency of solute on grain boundaries can be explained by these effects."}{"Microstructure and mechanical properties of dissimilar friction stir welded type 304 austenitic stainless steel to Q235 low carbon steel ": "In this work, friction stir welding (FSW) was used to weld dissimilar metals (Type 304 stainless steel (SS304) and Q235 low carbon steel). The microstructure, interfacial characteristics, residual stress distribution and mechanical properties of the joint were investigated. The results show that FSW results in grain refinement in the stir zone (SZ) and thermal-mechanical affected zone (TMAZ) in SS304 side. Discontinuous dynamic recrystallization and twinning-induced dynamic recrystallization are the main grain refinement mechanisms. Dynamic recovery occurs in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). On the Q235 steel side, the acicular ferrite and pearlite are generated in the SZ, which is due to its peak temperature of up to Ac3. Additionally, the amount of acicular ferrite decreases in the TMAZ. Continuous and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization is the main recrystallization mechanism in the two regions. The interfacial bonding mechanism of FSW joint consists of both mechanical and metallurgical bonding. In addition, the difference in expansion coefficient and microstructure between the two steels results in the formation of residual compressive stress in the SZ. Grain refinement and acicular ferrite are responsible for the microhardness distribution in the whole joint. The tensile strength of FSW joint is 493\u202fMPa, which is more than that of Q235 steel by around 4%. However, the elongation is 17%, which shows a decrease of around 50%. Furthermore, the fracture surface shows ductile fracture with dimples."}{"Morphological and compositional changes of MFe2O4@Co3O4 (M\u202f=\u202fNi, Zn) core-shell nanoparticles after mild reduction ": "NiFe2O4@Co3O4 and ZnFe2O4@Co3O4 core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized and reduced to be used as catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The as-synthesized materials were determined to have an incomplete Co3O4 shell around the ferrite core with a maximum thickness of 3\u202fnm. Using in-situ TEM, it was shown that reduction of these core-shell nanoparticles in pure hydrogen at 230\u202f\u00b0C and 250\u202f\u00b0C, respectively, resulted in the formation of small cobalt islands on the ferrite surface. Catalytic testing of the core-shell materials, NiFe2O4@Co3O4 and ZnFe2O4@Co3O4, after reduction showed a cobalt-time yield of 13.64 \u03bcmolCO\u00b7gCo\n                     \u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and 4.27 \u03bcmolCO\u00b7gCo\n                     \u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and a C5+ selectivity of 47 C-% and 68 C-%, respectively. The observed difference in cobalt-time yield and selectivity between NiFe2O4@Co3O4 and ZnFe2O4@Co3O4 core-shell nanoparticles was ascribed to a combination of effects that arose from the morphological and compositional changes that occurred after reduction and under Fischer-Tropsch synthesis conditions."}{"Precipitation microstructure in Al-Si-Mg-Mn alloy with Zr additions ": "The precipitation microstructure of Al-10Si-0.5\u202fMg-0.5Mn (wt%) alloys with different Zr additions was investigated. The \u03b2-type (i.e. Mg2Si) phase was observed to be dominant in the precipitation microstructure. Furthermore, the Q-Al5Cu2Mg8Si6 phase and the \u03c0-Al8Mg3FeSi6 phase were also observed to be the dominant thermodynamically stable precipitates at 180\u202f\u00b0C. The main strengthening effect can be attributed to the Q-Al5Cu2Mg8Si6 and \u03b2-type (i.e. Mg2Si) precipitates due to the fact that the \u03c0-Al8Mg3FeSi6 phase is relatively large in size, plate-like in morphology, and low in number density and thereby volume fraction. More importantly, the Zr addition into the Al-Si-Mg-Mn alloys causes the precipitation to start at a lower temperature during ageing, which can be due to the grain refinement effect by Zr addition and thereby enhanced diffusion. This paper provides some insights in precipitation microstructure and thereby shortening the ageing treatment at a relatively low ageing temperature."}{"Forescattered electron imaging of nanoparticles in scanning electron microscopy ": "In this study, we have used a Zr-Nb alloy containing well-defined nano-precipitates as a model material in which to study imaging contrast inversions (atomic number or diffraction contrast) observed with the forescattered electron imaging system, ARGUS\u2122, in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) when imaging a thin foil in a transmission geometry. The study is based on Monte Carlo simulations and analysis of micrographs experimentally acquired under different imaging conditions. Based on the results, imaging conditions that enhance atomic number or diffraction contrast have been proposed. Data acquired from the ARGUS\u2122 imaging system in an SEM has also been compared with results from standard transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging of the same material. These results demonstrate the capability of the ARGUS\u2122 system to investigate microstructures in nano-scale materials."}{"Microstructure and mechanical/electrochemical properties of friction stir butt welded joint of dissimilar aluminum and steel alloys ": "The microstructure and mechanical/electrochemical properties of friction stir welded (FSWed) joints of two dissimilar alloys, 5052-H32 aluminum and dual-phase (DP) steel, are studied. The FSW joint is fabricated with an offset of the FSW tool towards the DP steel on the advancing side of the tool. In the stir zone (SZ), three distinct regions are observed: i) a top layer consisting of the aluminum matrix with scattered steel fragments, ii) a middle layer having a mixed lamellar structure of FeAl solid solutions and intermetallic compounds (IMCs), and iii) a bottom layer consisting of the steel. IMCs are observed in the middle layer and at the interfaces between the aluminum and steel alloys. Very different hardness profiles are obtained in the three layers in the SZ. The electrochemical corrosion investigation reveals that the FSW joint exhibits a higher corrosion rate compared to the base materials due to the scattered steel fragments and the increase in martensite content and low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs)."}{"Construction of a nonlinear permeability model of pervious concrete and drainage simulation of heavy rain in a residential area ": "One of the aim of the paper is to demonstrate nonlinear permeability behaviour of pervious or porous concrete (PC). Paper summarises the results of the study which showed that mean flow velocity and hydraulic gradient are related through exponential function, then Darcy\u2019s law of linearity is not applicable for PC. Further, applicability of PC in residential areas is shown by assessing PC\u2019s pavement drainage properties through computer simulation. Results show that the non-linear permeability model of pervious concrete obtained from vertical permeability tests is applicable for horizontal direction of flow as well. In addition, it is confirmed that PC\u2019s effectiveness can be expected in decreasing and delaying a peak runoff of rain waters into rivers when PC pavement is widely arranged in a city block."}{"Quantifying the effects of hyperthermal atomic oxygen and thermal fatigue environments on carbon nanotube sheets for space-based applications ": "The effects of atomic oxygen and thermal fatigue on two different types of carbon nanotube sheets were studied. One set was treated with nitric acid, while the other set was left untreated. Monotonic tensile tests were performed before and after exposure to determine the effects of either exposure type on the sheets\u2019 mechanical properties. Electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference measurements were recorded to determine the effects of AO-exposure and thermal cycling on the sheets\u2019 electrical properties. Neither exposure type affected the sheets\u2019 specific strengths. Both exposure types increased the sheets\u2019 specific stiffnesses and decreased the sheets\u2019 strains at failure. The electrical conductivity of both sheets decreased due to the different exposure types, while the EMI shielding effectiveness was unaffected. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe any changes in the sheets\u2019 surface morphologies, while energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to determine the effects of AO on the sheets\u2019 chemical makeup."}{"Co-precipitation of tapioca starch and hydroxyapatite. Effects of phosphorylation of starch on mechanical properties of the composites ": "Organic-inorganic composites were prepared by co-precipitation of tapioca starch and hydroxyapatite (HAP) with polymer-hydroxyapatite weight ratios of 70/30, 50/50, and 30/70. Both tapioca starch (TS) and phosphorylated tapioca starch (PTS) were employed as starting materials and effects of phosphate groups of starch on hybridization were examined. Uniaxial hot press of the precipitated powder at 120\u00a0\u200b\u00b0C at 120\u00a0\u200bMPa afforded rectangular test blocks. The bending strength of TS-HAP (70:30), (50:50), and (30:70), and PTS-HAP (70:30), (50:50), and (30:70) were 19, 21, 18, 26, 37, and 36\u00a0\u200bMPa, respectively, and their strain at break were 2.6, 2.3, 1.7, 4.3, 3.5, and 2.7%, respectively. Both of the bending strength and strain at break were larger for the composites prepared from phosphorylated tapioca starch. The bending elastic modulus of the PTS-HAP composites increased with increasing the volume fraction of HAP in the composites, showing that rule of mixture is applicable to the PTS-HAP composites. Crystallite sizes of HAP were smaller for the composites prepared from phosphorylated tapioca starch than those prepared from tapioca starch. Therefore, phosphate groups in starch assisted nucleation of HAP and/or inhibited crystal growth of HAP, and stabilized the organic-inorganic interface by ionic interactions. Composites prepared from nongelatinized tapioca starch showed poorer mechanical properties than those prepared from gelatinized one. These carbon neutral composites should be promising as versatile light and rigid mechanical materials."}{"Nanocellulose based functional materials for supercapacitor applications ": "Environmental protection and renewable sources for energy conversion and storage remain an important topic nowadays.

Recent studies have disclosed the higher metastatic potential of circulating tumor cell (CTC) clusters than single CTCs. Despite long-term study on metastasis, the characterizations of its most potent cellular drivers, i.e., CTC clusters have only recently been investigated. The analysis of CTC clusters offers new intuitions into the mechanism of tumor metastasis and can lead to the development of cancer diagnosis and prognosis, drug screening, detection of gene mutations, and anti-metastatic therapeutics. In recent years, considerable attention has been dedicated to the development of efficient methods to separate CTC clusters from the patients\u2019 blood, mainly through micro technologies based on biological and physical principles. In this review, we summarize recent developments in CTC clusters with a particular emphasis on passive separation methods that specifically have been developed for CTC clusters or have the potential for CTC cluster separation. Methods such as liquid biopsy are of paramount importance for commercialized healthcare settings. Furthermore, the role of CTC clusters in metastasis, their physical and biological characteristics, clinical applications and current challenges of this biomarker are thoroughly discussed. The current review can shed light on the development of more efficient CTC cluster separation method that will enhance the pivotal understanding of the metastatic process and may be practical in contriving new strategies to control and suppress cancer and metastasis."}{"Recent developments in manganese oxide based nanomaterials with oxygen reduction reaction functionalities for energy conversion and storage applications: A review ": "In this article, a brief overview of manganese oxide nanomaterials (NMs) potential towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for microbial fuel cell (MFC), bioremediations, and battery applications is discussed. It's known that using non-renewable fossil fuels as a direct energy source causes greenhouse gas emissions. Safe, sustainable and renewable energy sources for biofuel cell (BFC) and metal-air batteries hold considerable potential for clean electrical energy generators without the need for a thermal cycle.

As-prepared membranes were subjected to different characterization techniques such as XRD, FTIR, DSC, ac impedance analysis and transference number measurement. The amorphous/crystalline nature of the prepared biopolymers was studied by using XRD. FTIR study has revealed the formation of complexes between the cellulose acetate and the magnesium perchlorate.

In this work, reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) thin films of varying thicknesses are fabricated onto Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) glass via electrophoretic deposition technique. The sample thicknesses increase with increasing number of deposition cycles (5, 10, 20 cycles). It is hypothesized that such rGO thin films, which are well-known for their high thermal conductivities, can conduct heat away laterally towards heat sinks and reduce near-infrared (NIR) transmittance through them, thus effectively slowing down the temperature increment indoors. The performance of rGO/FTO in reducing indoor temperatures is investigated with a solar simulator and a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The 20-cycles rGO thin films showed 30% more NIR blocked at 1000\u00a0nm as compared to clean FTO, as well as the least temperature increment of 0.57\u00a0\u00b0C following 30\u00a0min of solar irradiation. Furthermore, the visible transmittance of the as-fabricated rGO films remain on par with commercial solar films, enabling up to 60% of visible light transmittance for optimal balance of transparency and heat reduction. These results suggest that the rGO thin films have great potential in blocking heat transfer and are highly recommended for smart window applications."}{"Influence of Bi doping on physical properties of lead halide perovskites: a comparative first-principles study between CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3\n             ": "We study the effects of Bi doping on the physical properties of CsPbX\n                     3 (X\u00a0=\u00a0I or Br), promising active materials in application to the solar cell, using first-principles calculations with the hybrid functional. In both CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, we find that excess electrons introduced by Bi replacing Pb (BiPb) are mostly compensated by native acceptors such as Cs and Pb vacancies. As a result, the equilibrium Fermi level lies far below the defect level of BiPb, indicating that BiPb prefers the 1+\u00a0charge state over the neutral one. The band structure of Bi-doped CsPbX\n                     3 shows that the interaction between the defect and host states affects the conduction band, narrowing the bandgap of the host material. The formation energy of BiPb is smaller in CsPbI3 than in CsPbBr3, implying the easier doping of Bi in CsPbI3. The computational results successfully explain distinct doping effects on absorption spectra between CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3, which was observed in recent experiments."}{"Biomimicry, biomineralization, and bioregeneration of bone using advanced three-dimensional fibrous hydroxyapatite scaffold ": "Biomimicry, biomineralization, and bioregeneration technologies will pave the way for regenerative medicine toward\u00a0better human health. Functional fibrous scaffold with extracellular matrix\u2013like natural structure and the three-dimensional (3D) network is crucial to meet the complex requirements of cell and new bone tissue growth. In this study, we fabricated 3D fibrous hydroxyapatite scaffold (3D FHAS) with biomimicry, biomineralization, and bioregeneration functionalities toward\u00a0the regeneration and repair of injured bone tissues by integrated electrospinning, phase transformation, and mineralization technique. Our method improved the osteogenic property of the fibrous scaffold.

A general synthesis method to prepare PAFs is to build new C\u2013C bond among aromatic rings through various cross-coupling reactions by using metal complex catalysts. However, the construction of PAFs through formation of new aromatic rings is rarely mentioned in the literature. In this work, two kinds of two-dimensional (2D) PAFs are obtained by the triple condensation reaction of acetyl aryl compounds. Compared with the general method, this synthetic method has the advantages that the reaction does not require any metal catalysts and can be carried out in the air with high yield. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images display the large-scale 2D structure of the product. 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (13C ss-NMR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra are used to prove the decreasing number of acetyl groups and the formation of aromatic rings after the condensation reaction completed. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and contact angle (CA) test measurements demonstrate good thermal stability and hydrophobicity of materials.

Recently, machine learning regression algorithms show great promises for building high-accuracy potential fields for atomistic modeling with length scales and timescales far beyond those achievable by first principles calculations. In this work, using both crystalline and amorphous silicon as examples, we develop machine learning\u2013based potential fields for predicting thermal conductivity. The machine learning\u2013based interatomic potential is derived from density functional theory calculations by stochastically sampling the potential energy surface in the configurational space. The thermal conductivities of both amorphous and crystalline silicon are then calculated using equilibrium molecular dynamics, which agree well with experimental measurements.

Magnetism, and the magnetic moment\u2013charged carrier interactions, has been suggested to enhance the efficiency of some compounds. Nevertheless, decoupling of the magnetic and the carrier concentration\u2013related effects has never been achieved to prove once and for all, the importance of magnetism in thermoelectricity. Herein, we report improved quality criterion of bismuth telluride upon chromium substitution. The magnetic interactions with the magnetic moment carried by Cr atoms have increased the electrons' effective mass, enhancing the thermopower. Combined with the decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity, the overall performance of these compounds has been enhanced by 25% at constant carrier concentration, an improvement seldom observed. This is a robust enhancement principle because magnetic interactions are effective at high temperatures above the transition temperature, unlike magnon drag which is dependent on ordering and typically a low temperature phenomenon. Our results indicate that taking advantage of such relatively easily implemented magnetic doping effects along with existing strategies can lead to enhanced efficiency of thermoelectric materials."}{"Amplified CO2 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with C2CNT carbon nanotube composites ": "Production of cement, aluminum, magnesium, titanium, and steel structural materials\u00a0generate more than 2 gigatonnes of CO2 globally per year. Replacement of structural materials with lightweight, stronger carbon nanotube\u00a0(CNT) composites reduces the structural material's production aggregate requirements by achieving the same strength with less material. This averts a massive CO2 emission in the production of structural materials. CNTs have the highest measured tensile strength of all materials and form strong composites, but until recently, they were produced only by high carbon footprint processes. CNTs are synthesized in this study from CO2 (are carbon negative) by low-energy C2CNT (CO2 to CNT) molten electrolysis. Four tonnes of CO2 electrolyzed forms one tonne of CNTs. This avoids several hundred tonnes of CO2 by replacing structural materials with CNT composites. For example, a 2-tonne cement block with 0.001 tonne of CNTs has the same strength as a 3-tonne block without CNTs. The 1-tonne cement avoided eliminates its CO2 production emission. Specifically, a 0.048\u00a0wt% CNT-cement composite eliminates 840 tonne of CO2/tonne CNT. CO2 is eliminated from the anthropogenic carbon cycle at less than $1 per tonne. High carbon footprint materials such as aluminum trigger larger CO2 composite elimination effects, and 1 tonne of CNT extraordinarily eliminates more than 4000 tonne CO2/tonne CNTs."}{"State of the Art Advancements in Studies and Applications of Graphene: A Comprehensive Review ": "Graphene, originally observed under electron microscope in 1962, and rediscovered in 2004, is a newly emerging crystalline form of carbon. Known as the thinnest known material, graphene, a one-atom-thick and a Nobel Prize Winning material has outstanding mechanical, thermal and electrical properties, making it one of the most sought-after materials in engineering domain. Owing to its peculiar and unconventional two-dimensional structure, it has unique linear energy bands which is very unusual as far as conventional parabolic energy bands of other materials are concerned. The two-dimensional structure of graphene is associated with a two-component wave-function (for TQD), implication of which is the lattice symmetry which can be explained on the basis of Klein\u2019s paradox. This paper presents the structural study and techniques for characterization of graphene. It is followed by the discussions on the rheological background which plays a crucial role in the study of graphene along with its electrical, mechanical and thermal properties. A peculiar concept of second Piola-Kirchhoff stress is discussed. Subsequent discussions emphasize the synthesis methods for graphene. Finally, we present the applications of graphene in various indirect engineering domains like healthcare, use of graphene for \u2018Toxicity Studies\u2019. The widespread popularity of graphene is attributed to it\u2019s excellent mechanical, thermal and electrical properties, the result of which is its extensive use in numerous applications over the last decade, Carbon-Nanotubes (CNT) being the prominent example."}{"High yield cycloaddition of carbon dioxide to epoxides catalyzed by metal\u2013organic frameworks ": "A series of metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) based on trimesic acid (also knows benzene tricarboxylic acid [btc]) have been synthesized by a solvothermal procedure which exhibit\u00a0excellent catalytic fixation of CO2. Cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides to produce cyclic carbonates is quite promising. The chemical fixation of CO2 reported here is solvent free and carried out under moderately mild conditions. All the MOFs [Zn-btc (1), Co-btc (2), Ni-btc (3), and Cu-btc (4)] were synthesized under same experimental conditions\u00a0yet possess different structural and catalytic properties. All the catalysts follow first-order kinetics, and Zn-btc (1) proved to be the most catalytically active catalyst among all, with \u223c100% yield with a total turnover number of 18,845 mol\u22121\u00a0and an initial turnover frequency (hour\u22121) of 946 with respect to the cyclic carbonate. All MOFs (1\u20134) show almost 100% conversion in these reactions. The same reaction using other metal (Co, Ni, Cu)-btc compounds has also resulted in products with more than 94% yield, creating an extra impact on the importance of the work."}{"A critical review on the fabrication processes and performance of polyamide biocomposites from a biofiller perspective ": "While many fillers have been used to tailor the properties of polyamides, the incorporation of bio-based reinforcement has been limited because of their low thermal stability and the high processing temperature of polyamides. The objective of this review is to analyze the current knowledge on strategies aimed at improving and making natural fiber reinforced polyamide biocomposite fabrication viable with improved properties. A discussion on (bio-)polyamides is introduced, and critical factors affecting their mechanical properties during compounding with natural fibers are discussed. Benefits and limitations of each strategy employed are summarized with a discussion on the contributions to the final material performance, cost, and environmental impact. These strategies involved limiting the natural fibers thermal degradation via process control, material, and fiber modifications."}{"Historical review of computer simulation of radiation effects in materials ": "In this Article, I review the development of computer simulation techniques for studying radiation effects in materials from 1946 until 2018. These developments were often closely intertwined with associated experimental developments, which are also briefly discussed in conjunction with the simulations. The focus is on methods that either deal directly with the primary radiation damage generation event, or with such defects or phase changes that typically occur due to radiation. The methods discussed at some length are, in order of historical appearance: Reaction rate theory or rate equations (RE), Monte Carlo neutronics calculations (MCN), Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC), Molecular Dynamics (MD), Binary Collision Approximation (BCA), Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC), Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD), Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), and Finite Element Modelling (FEM). For each method, I present the origins of the methods, some key developments after this, as well as give some opinions on possible future development paths."}{"Short communication: \u2018Low activation, refractory, high entropy alloys for nuclear applications\u2019 ": "Two new, low activation high entropy alloys (HEAs) TiVZrTa and TiVCrTa are studied for use as in-core, structural nuclear materials for in-core nuclear applications. Low-activation is a desirable property for nuclear reactors, in an attempt to reduce the amount of high level radioactive waste upon decommissioning, and for consideration in fusion applications. The alloy TiVNbTa is used as a starting composition to develop two new HEAs; TiVZrTa and TiVCrTa. The new alloys exhibit comparable indentation hardness and modulus, to the TiVNbTa alloy in the as-cast state. After heavy ion implantation the new alloys show an increased irradiation resistance."}{"Hydrogen in zirconium alloys: A review ": "Hydrogen absorbed into zirconium alloy nuclear fuel cladding as a result of the waterside corrosion reaction can affect the properties of nuclear fuel, principally through the precipitation of brittle hydride particles. Multiple phenomena are involved in this overall process: after hydrogen pickup degradation of mechanical properties is controlled by hydrogen transport, hydride precipitation and dissolution kinetics and the formation of specific mesoscale hydride microstructures. The precipitation of hydrides especially affects cladding ductility and fracture toughness, but can also affect other phenomena, including via stress-induced hydride reorientation. These processes can affect cladding performance both during normal operation and during extended dry storage, as hydride morphology can be modified during the preparatory vacuum drying processes. We review the processes of hydrogen transport, hydride precipitation and dissolution and formation of mesoscale hydride microstructures, and highlight where more research is needed, both from an experimental and from a modeling point of view."}{"Ferritic-martensitic steels for fission and fusion applications ": "Compared to austenitic stainless steels, largely employed in the early fission reactors, high chromium Ferritic/Martenstic (FM) steels, developed since the first half of the 20th century for fossil-fuel power-plants, have a number of advantageous properties among which lower thermal expansion, higher thermal conductivity and better void swelling resistance. At the beginning of the 1970s, FM steels found their first nuclear application as wrapper and fuel cladding materials in sodium-cooled fast reactors. They are now the reference materials for in-vessel components of future fusion reactors, and are considered for in-pile and out-of-pile applications in Generation IV reactors as well as for various other nuclear systems. In this paper, after an introductory historical overview, the challenges associated with the use of FM steels in advanced reactors are addressed, including fabrication, joining and codification issues. The long term evolution of mechanical properties such as the creep and creep-fatigue behaviors is discussed and the degradation phenomena occurring in aggressive environments (lead alloys, high temperature gases, super-critical water and CO2, molten salts) are detailed. The paper also provides a brief overview of the radiation effects in FM steels. The influence of the key radiation parameters e.g. temperature, dose and dose rate on the microstructure and mechanical properties are discussed. The need to better understand the synergistic effects of displacement damage and helium produced by transmutation in fusion conditions is highlighted."}{"High temperature oxidation and microstructural evolution of cold spray chromium coatings on Zircaloy-4 in steam environments ": "Oxidation kinetics and microstructural evolution of cold sprayed Cr coatings on Zircaloy-4 at 1130\u20131310\u202f\u00b0C in flowing steam at atmospheric pressure have been studied. The study is aimed at understanding of the response of Cr coated Zr-alloy under a steam environment and high temperatures pertinent to design basis accidents (DBAs) and beyond design basis accidents (BDBAs) in light water reactors (LWRs). Surface morphology, microstructure, and phases of post-oxidation test samples were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). Growth kinetics of the Cr-oxide scale and interdiffusion layers between the Cr coating and the Zr-alloy substrate were quantified from cross-sectional SEM images. Cross-sectional analysis showed that the Cr coatings offered a 50 times reduction in oxidation rate over bare Zircaloy-4 in a 1310\u202f\u00b0C steam environment. Oxidation kinetics at 1130\u202f\u00b0C followed parabolic law (i.e., n\u202f\u223c\u202f0.5 in power law kinetics) but at 1230\u202f\u00b0C and 1310\u202f\u00b0C the value of n was suppressed to below 0.5 possibly due to the volatilization of Cr species at the two highest temperatures. Interdiffusion at coating/substrate interface resulted in formation of a brittle Cr2Zr or Zr(Fe, Cr)2 intermetallic compound layer on the order of micrometer in thickness and scattered Cr-rich precipitates were observed well below the interface within the Zr-alloy substrate after cooling. These experimental results could provide data to LWR system simulation codes for better estimation of coping time in the event of accidents."}{"Effect of annealing on microstructure, texture and hardness of ITER-specification tungsten analyzed by EBSD, vickers micro-hardness and nano-indentation techniques ": "Tungsten and its alloys have been extensively studied to be used as materials for plasma facing components (PFCs) in future nuclear fusion reactors. Under fusion operating conditions, the surface of PFCs will experience high heat flux exposure which will affect some microstructural features of the material. In the present work, the effect of annealing temperature on microstructure, texture and mechanical behavior of ITER-specification commercial pure tungsten was investigated by combining Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), Vickers micro-hardness and nano-indentation techniques. The samples were analyzed in the as-received and in the annealed conditions. Annealing was done for 1\u202fh\u202fat three different temperatures: 1300\u202f\u00b0C, 1500\u202f\u00b0C and 1800\u202f\u00b0C. Three stages in microstructural evolution were observed: recovery at 1300\u202f\u00b0C, recrystallization at 1500\u202f\u00b0C and grain growth at 1800\u202f\u00b0C. As the annealing temperature increases and recrystallization takes place, \u03b1-fiber texture components are strengthened. Simultaneously, a reduction in both Vickers and nano-indentation hardness is found."}{"General corrosion and stress corrosion cracking of Alloy 600 in light water reactor primary coolants ": "The general corrosion and stress corrosion cracking behaviors of the nickel-base Alloy 600 in the primary high temperature aqueous coolants of light water cooled and moderated nuclear power reactors are reviewed. The compatible welding Alloys 182 and 82 as well as the high strength, precipitation hardened analogue, Alloy X-750, are also included. The emphasis is on what is known of the underlying science of these degradation phenomena rather than on the associated engineering consequences and remedies."}{"Strain localization in copper canister FSW welds for spent nuclear fuel disposal ": "Spent nuclear fuel disposal in copper canisters in a deep geologic repository is planned in Finland and Sweden. The purpose of the copper shell is to perform as a ductile corrosion barrier to prevent radioactive substances from leaking into the environment. Therefore, the most important property of the copper shell, besides the good corrosion resistance, is its ductility. The copper canisters are sealed by friction stir welding (FSW), which results in strong welds when compared to the base materials, but the microstructural heterogeneity introduced by the welding may also lead to strain localization. Thus, the strain localization behavior of two different copper canister welds was studied by tensile tests in combination with digital image correlation (DIC). The main difference between the welds is the utilization of shielding gas to reduce oxidation during welding. The shielding gas improves the stability of the welding process, as well as reduces the number of oxide particles in the welds. It is known, that oxide particles are detrimental in copper in the presence of hydrogen. Therefore, the two welds were also thermally hydrogen charged to study hydrogen trapping in the weld material. Thermal desorption measurements (TDS) show that considerable hydrogen uptake occurs in the weld oxide zone, but it did not compromise the ductility of the copper welds in these tests. However, the DIC tests indicate considerably earlier strain localization on the retreating side of the new weld, welded with the shielding gas. This is attributed to differences in the initial state of the lid materials."}{"A high-resolution characterization of the oxide-metal interface in Zircaloy-4 and its relation to the oxidation and hydrogen pickup mechanisms ": "Oxide growth and hydrogen pickup have been measured for Zircaloy-4 in environments of different pH. The metal-oxide interface has been studied at high-resolution over sufficient lengths to show meaningful trends in the behaviour of the ZrO and oxygen-saturated metal layers (suboxides). It was found that suboxide width decreases rapidly at transition, then increases more slowly. The suboxide width is a constant proportion of the dioxide width prior to transition, but drops then increases after transition. Density functional theory was used to predict suboxide stability under different pressures.\n                  The behaviour of the suboxide can be explained on the assumption that the dioxide layer is the protective layer until it is bypassed by the environment percolating into the crack network.\n                  The relation between hydrogen pickup rate and the oxide behaviour suggests that hydrogen moves across the Zircaloy-4 oxide with no net charge, and that the role of the constrained environment within the cracked fossil oxide requires investigation."}{"Chemical compatibility of silicon carbide in molten fluoride salts for the fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor ": "Silicon carbide is widely appreciated for its high temperature strength, radiation tolerance and neutronic transparency in applications for fuel particles and core internals of nuclear reactors. In the Fluoride Salt-Cooled High Temperature Reactor, silicon carbide ceramic matrix composites are candidate construction material for regions of higher neutron fluxes. Silicon carbide is wettable and reacts electrochemically with dissolved metals. Metallic impurities, tritium, moisture-based impurities and fission products, as well as thermal gradients can accelerate hot corrosion of silicon carbide in molten fluoride salt. Tritium can become trapped in radiation defects of silicon carbide. Thus, an understanding of the potential for tritium absorption, impurities reactions and thermal gradient-assisted corrosion mechanisms along with tritium recovery and redox control systems are necessary to mitigate silicon carbide corrosion in molten fluoride salt systems. Here, we survey current research on silicon carbide corrosion in molten fluoride salts and critically evaluate the research and development gaps."}{"Verification of the theory of primary radiation damage by comparison with experimental data ": "Understanding of radiation damage in a solid is important for development of advanced material technologies, namely, for space application, electron microscopy, semiconductor processing, fission and nuclear fusion. Space materials must withstand exposure to high-energy protons. Construction materials of future thermonuclear reactors must withstand exposure to high-energy neutrons. Many properties of materials including mechanical properties are governed by the presence and behavior of lattice defects. Hence, the study of the radiation-induced defects is an important task combining two fields: radiation physics and solid state physics. The paper presents new knowledge on primary defect formation in the main materials for advanced fission and nuclear fusion reactors, bcc tungsten (W) and bcc iron (Fe). The objective of this work is to compare the new experimental data of neutron- and proton-induced defects in W and Fe using well-established method of positron-annihilation lifetime-spectroscopy (PALS) in combination with the literature data with two models of radiation damage, the classical Norgett-Robinson-Torrens (NRT-dpa) model and recently developed athermal recombination corrected (arc-dpa) model. It is shown that experimental data for neutron- and proton-irradiated Fe are better described by arc-dpa model than NRT-dpa model. Whereas experimental data for neutron- and proton-irradiated W are between the NRT-dpa and arc-dpa predictions. The obtained results shed new light on the formation of the primary radiation defects in materials and indicate the need for further development of the theory of radiation damage in a solid."}{"Quantitative investigation on sink strength of nano-grain boundary for irradiation resistance ": "It has long been recognized that grain boundary (GB) is an effective sink to trap irradiation-induced defects. Introducing large densities of GBs becomes an effective strategy to enhance irradiation resistance. However, the nano-grained materials have poor stability under the extreme irradiation, and the effect of nano-GB characters on the irradiation sink strength is largely unknown. Here, the sink strength of nano-GB is quantitatively investigated in the nano-grained Cu and dilute Cu\u2013W alloys with the average grain size ranging from \u223c20 to \u223c50\u202fnm by \u223c300\u202fkeV He ions irradiation at room temperature and 673\u202fK. The irradiation induced void volume ratio, size and distribution are confirmed to strongly depend on the grain size and irradiation temperature. The nano-GBs with different characters, such as the misorientation and GB plane, have similar relative energy. The nano-GB sink strength is independent on the GB characters, deriving from the highly curved nano-GB plane having excess volume and energy. Combining with molecular dynamics simulations, we can conclude that nano-grain size is the most vital factor for the sink strength with respect to the GB characters. With the increase of temperature and the decrease of grain size, the stable nano-GBs exhibit a behavior of \u201cideal\u201d defects sink due to their high volume ratio and the increased point defect recombination probability. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of the nano-GB sink efficiency and offer a guidance for designing nano-grained structural materials with optimum anti-irradiation performance for future fusion reactors."}{"Silicate stabilisation of colloidal UO2 produced by uranium metal corrosion ": "U(IV) mobility can be significantly enhanced by colloids in both engineered and natural environments. This is particularly relevant in decommissioning and clean-up of nuclear facilities, such as legacy fuel ponds and silos at the Sellafield site, UK, and in long-term radioactive waste geodisposal. In this study, the product of metallic uranium (U) corrosion under anaerobic, alkaline conditions was characterised, and the interaction of this product with silicate solutions was investigated. The U metal corrosion product consisted of crystalline UO2 nanoparticles (5\u201310\u202fnm) that aggregated to form clusters larger than 20\u202fnm. Sequential ultrafiltration indicated that a small fraction of the U metal corrosion product was colloidal. When the uranium corrosion product was reacted with silicate solutions under anaerobic conditions, ultrafiltration indicated a stable colloidal uranium fraction was formed. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and high resolution TEM confirmed that the majority of U was still present as UO2 after several months of exposure to silicate solutions, but an amorphous silica coating was present on the UO2 surface. This silica coating is believed to be responsible for formation of the UO2 colloid fraction. Atomic-resolution scanning TEM (STEM) indicated some migration of U into the silica-coating of the UO2 particles as non-crystalline U(IV)-silicate, suggesting alteration of UO2 at the UO2-silica interface had occurred. This alteration at the UO2-silica interface is a potential pathway to the formation of U-silicates (e.g. coffinite, USiO4)."}{"Safe innovation approach: Towards an agile system for dealing with innovations ": "Nanotechnologies are characterized by a growing legacy of already marketed and novel manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) and nano-enabled products with a lack of a coherent risk governance system to address their safety effectively. In response to this situation, a proactive system is needed to minimize the gap between the pace of innovation and the pace of developing nano-specific risk governance. With the Safe Innovation Approach (SIA), we seek to enhance the ability of all stakeholders to address the safety assessment of innovations in a robust yet agile manner. The SIA is an approach that combines a) the Safe-by-Design (SbD) concept, which recommends industry to integrate safety considerations as early as possible into the innovation process, and b) the Regulatory Preparedness (RP) concept which aims to improve anticipation of regulators in order that they can facilitate the development of adaptable (safety) regulation that can keep up with the pace of knowledge generation and innovation of MNMs and MNM-enabled products. SIA promotes a safe and responsible approach for industry when developing innovative products and materials, and stimulates a proactive attitude amongst policymakers and regulators to minimize the time gap between appearance and approval of innovation and appropriate legislation. Here we introduce a SIA framework consisting of creating SIA awareness, developing a SIA methodology (SbD scenarios, SbD methodology including information needs, functionality, and grouping, SIA Toolbox and a nano-specific database), bringing the Trusted Environment and RP concept into an operational level, and the development of novel business for industry and novel governance models for regulators. The SIA framework once implemented will result in a system for MNMs and nano-enabled products that is agile and robust. Current international efforts such as in the OECD are now trying to bring this concept to practice."}{"Antibacterial polymer fibres by rosin compounding and melt-spinning ": "The antibacterial features of natural pine/spruce rosin are well established, yet the functionality in various thermoplastics has not been surveyed. This work focuses on the processing of industrial grade purified rosin mixed with polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polylactic acid (PLA), polyamide (PA) and corn starch based biopolymer (CS). Homopolymer masterbatches were extrusion-compounded and melt-spun to form fibres for a wide range of products, such as filters, reinforcements, clothing and medical textiles. Due to the versatile chemical structure of rosin, it was observed compatible with all the selected polymers. In general, the rosin-blended systems were shear-thinning in a molten condition. The doped fibres spun of PE and PP indicated adequate melt-spinning capability and proper mechanical properties in terms of ultimate strength and Young's modulus. The antibacterial response was found dependent on the selected polymer. Especially PE with a 10\u202fwt% rosin content showed significant antibacterial effects against Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12598 when analysed in the Ringer's solution for 24\u202fh."}{"Innovative Data Management in advanced characterization: Implications for materials design ": "This paper describes a novel methodology of data documentation in materials characterization, which has as starting point the creation and usage of any Data Management Plan (DMP) for scientific data in the field of materials science and engineering, followed by the development and exploitation of ontologies for the harnessing of data created through experimental techniques. The case study that is discussed here is nanoindentation, a widely used method for the experimental assessment of mechanical properties on a small scale.\n                  The new documentation structure for characterization data (CHADA) is based on the definition of (i) sample, (ii) method, (iii) raw data and (iv) data analysis as the main component of the metadata associated to any characterization experiment. In this way, the relevant information can be stored inside the metadata associated to the experiment. The same methodology can be applicable to a large number of techniques that produce big amount of raw data, while at the same time it can be invaluable tool for big data analysis and for the creation of an open innovation environment, where data can be accessed freely and efficiently.\n                  Other fundamental aspects are reviewed in the paper, including the taxonomy and curation of data, the creation of ontology and classification of characterization techniques, the harnessing of data in open innovation environments via database construction along with the retrieval of information via algorithms. The issues of harmonization and standardization of such novel approaches are also critically discussed. Finally, the possible implications for nanomaterial design and the potential industrial impact of the new approach are described and a critical outlook is given."}{"XRD and 29Si MAS NMR study on carbonated cement paste under accelerated carbonation using different concentration of CO2\n             ": "In this study, the chemical composition of cement pastes, exposed to accelerated carbonation using different concentration of CO2 (3%, 10%, 20%, 50%,100%), have been determined and compared with those of natural carbonation (0.03%). Quantitative X-ray diffraction (QXRD) and 29Si Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS NMR) were used for characterisation and quantitative analysis of the carbonated phases. The obtained QXRD results revealed that the complete carbonation was hardly attained. Calcite, aragonite and vaterite were in co-existence after accelerated carbonation, while vaterite was dominant. The preferential polymorphic precipitation of the three crystal forms of calcium carbonate was affected by the carbonation degree of C-S-H and the duration of the carbonation process, but not by the concentration of CO2. The NMR results indicated that C-S-H gel was strongly decalcified, and calcium modified silica gel was formed after carbonation. The C-S-H decalcification, under all the accelerated carbonation conditions, was clearly more pronounced than that under the natural carbonation conditions. When the concentration of CO2 was in the range of 3%\u201320%, the ratio of decalcified to remaining C-S-H was similar, in a range of 5\u20136, while under the higher concentration of CO2 this ratio was increased to >8. Therefore, in consideration of both acceleration rate and measurement uncertainty, the higher concentration, up to 20%, of CO2 in an accelerated carbonation should be applicable."}{"Micro and mesomechanics of fibre reinforced composites using mean field homogenization formulations: A review ": "Efficient deployment of composites necessitates robust modelling approaches for homogenization and micromechanics calculations. Mean field homogenization (MFH) methods are a class of versatile and accurate methods used for analysis of different types of composites varying from unidirectional composites to textile composites to short fibre reinforced composites to nano-tube reinforced composites. Micro and meso-mechanics of composites using MFH methods involves transformation of fibre architecture to assembly of ellipsoid inclusions, homogenization of the transformed RVE by making suitable simplifications about interactions between inclusions, and localization of stresses leading to damage/defect modelling. An in-depth review of the three steps for composites with varied reinforcement architecture including continuous straight, discontinuous short, discontinuous curved or wavy (including nano-tubes), textile and fibres with imperfect interphases reinforcements is presented."}{"Selective laser melting of 316L stainless steel: Influence of TiB2 addition on microstructure and mechanical properties ": "This study investigates the influence of TiB2 addition on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a 316L stainless steel synthesized by laser-based powder bed fusion process of commonly known as selective laser melting. A complex cellular microstructure with fine sub- grains, characteristic microstructure of the unreinforced 316L matrix is found in all samples. The addition of the TiB2 particles significantly reduces the size of both grains and the cells. The TiB2 particles are homogeneously dispersed in the 316L matrix and they form circular precipitates with sizes around 50\u2013100\u202fnm along the grain boundaries. A weak texture is formed due to addition of TiB2 particles. These microstructural features significantly strengthen the composites as-compared with the unreinforced 316L specimens. As a result of the addition of TiB2 particles, the yield strength increases from 412\u202f\u00b1\u202f7\u202fMPa for SMC-0 to 600\u202f\u00b1\u202f3\u202fMPa and 845\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u202fMPa for SMC-2.5 and SMC-5\u202fsamples, respectively."}{"Chemical cross-linking methods for cell encapsulation in hydrogels ": "Cell-encapsulating hydrogels are of tremendous interest in regenerative medicine. Tissue engineering relies on biomaterials able to act as artificial extracellular matrices to guide cells towards the development of new tissues. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to design biomaterials which mimic cells\u2019 native environment, thus encouraging natural behavior. The choice of biomaterial in which cells are embedded is crucial for their survival, proliferation and differentiation. Being more stable, chemical hydrogels are preferred over physical hydrogels as cell-laden substrates. When designing chemical hydrogels, scientists must choose not only the nature of the network (synthetic and/or bio-polymers) but also the type of cross-link bridging hydrogel constituents. For that purpose, numerous chemistries have been used (i) to introduce reactive functions on the hydrogel precursors and (ii) to form covalent bonds in the presence of living cells. The review will discuss the advantages and limitations of each strategy."}{"Recent advances in electrospun polycaprolactone based scaffolds for wound healing and skin bioengineering applications ": "Electrospun poly(\u01b9-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds incorporated with bioactive materials play a key role in tissue engineering applications due to their extra cellular matrix (ECM) mimicking property, biocompatibility and biodegradability. Electrospinning is one of the most successful techniques for the fabrication of nonwoven, three-dimensional, porous, and nano or submicron scale fiber-based matrices with tunable morphology. Investigations on the use of electrospun PCL and its blends/composites for skin reconstruction has gained much momentum recently. Feasibility of improving the cell attachment and antimicrobial properties of scaffolds by incorporating active agents such as growth factors, medications and nanomaterials have been frequently investigated. For rapid wound healing, electrospun wound dressings/skin substitutes should be able to accelerate wound healing and enhance cell proliferation. Gradual degradation of the scaffold along with tissue regeneration is also very important. Thus, carefully designed scaffolds that can improve the skin regeneration along with the potential to promote rapid wound healing has become a promising strategy in tissue regeneration therapies. This review outlines, a comprehensive overview of electrospun PCL based scaffolds in the context of skin bioengineering and wound healing. It sought to give an understanding about the advances in electrospun PCL scaffolds after the incorporation of active agents and the need to take these advances from bench side to clinical practice."}{"Compositionally graded high entropy alloy with a strong front and ductile back ": "Material components with graded properties can be ideal for many advanced applications due to their seamless nature of microstructural transition, cost reduction and high resistance of failure. A compositionally graded AlXCoCrFeNi (x\u2009=\u20090.3\u20130.7) high entropy alloy composite build was additively manufactured using laser engineered net shaping (LENS\u2122). In this high throughput production process, the elemental composition of Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni powders in the hoppers were varied and the feed rates were tuned to create a laminate of Al0.3CoCrFeNi and Al0.7CoCrFeNi layers, with a 500\u2009\u03bcm wide transition zone of intermediary composition. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy along the build direction verified the elemental composition matching closely with the targeted compositions. X-ray diffraction revealed the Al0.3CoCrFeNi to be a single-phase face centered cubic (fcc) structure whereas Al0.7CoCrFeNi had dual phase fcc\u2009+\u2009B2. Scanning electron microscopy was used to capture the microstructural features in the two layers as well as the transition zone. The massive shift in mechanical properties of hardness, dynamic strength and work hardening rates in this graded composite have been discussed. With this endeavor, microstructural complexity of HEAs has been combined with unique advantage of LENS\u2122 to achieve ingenious path to fabricate materials suited applications demanding variable strength and ductility/toughness."}{"Surface modification of cellulose nanofiber using acid anhydride for poly(lactic acid) reinforcement ": "This research examined the performance of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) by the addition of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as a filler. CNF produced by green fibrillation method without any chemical pre-treatment had advantages in low cost and time saving, which can produce bulky CNF in a short period compared with traditional methods such as acid dialysis and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) oxidation. It was demonstrated that modification on the hydroxyl group of cellulose into acetyl group changed the compatibility of CNF with PLA. Acetylated cellulose nanofiber (ACNF) and PLA formed smooth surface composite films with good transparency and mechanical properties. Moreover, the tensile strength of neat PLA film was improved by 25% when 1\u202fwt% of ACNF was used as the filler.

The microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-welded and post weld heat treated joints were investigated. The tensile strength and elongation of as-welded joints were 130.17 MPa and 2.87% respectively and the efficiency of the joint was 59% with respect to AZ91 magnesium alloy. The tensile strength, elongation, and efficiency of the joints after post weld heat treatment for 60 min were improved by 8.8%, 32.4%, and 3.8% respectively. The stir zone had a fine and homogeneous grain structure and relatively larger grains observed in the heat affected zones. The grain structure of the weld zone improved and the hardness of the stir zone was reduced by 12.95% after heat treatment. The fracture spot of the tensile specimens remains unchanged for as-welded as well as post welded heat treated joints."}{"One-Pot hydrothermal approach to graphene/Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) composites for high-capacitance supercapacitors ": "Here the oxidative polymerization of 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene and hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide were proceeded simultaneously, which enables the in-situ coating of the bridged poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanodendrites onto the highly-conductive graphene skeletons. The as-produced homogeneous graphene/PEDOT composites possess open channels, large accessible surface, fast charge transport, and high electrochemical utilization. The as-fabricated supercapacitor based such nanocomposites therefore exhibits larger specific capacitance (364\u202fF\u202fg\u22121 at 10\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121; 174\u202fF\u202fg\u22121 at 1.0\u202fA\u202fg\u22121), better rate capability (154\u202fF\u202fg\u22121 at 20.0\u202fA\u202fg\u22121), lower interface resistance, and higher cycling stability (retaining 91.4% over 10,000 cycles at 10\u202fA\u202fg\u22121) compared to the PEDOT counterpart (328\u202fF\u202fg\u22121 at 10\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121; 147\u202fF\u202fg\u22121 at 1.0\u202fA\u202fg\u22121; 87% retention after 10,000 cycles).

The hydrogel formulations were determined for molecular interaction, viscoelastic, thermal properties and phase behavior. The results indicated that all hydrogels were clear and semi-solid. The cPVA was obtained from the crosslink between the PVA with borate and the PVA with borate and ascorbate. These molecules interacted to each other by forming the hydrogen bonding between borate ions, ascorbate and polymer chains or formed intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. There is no chemical interaction between the molecules of cPVA and P407. The viscoelasticity of hydrogels exhibited sol-gel transition as frequency and temperature sweep. Incorporating cPVA into hydrogel elevated gelling temperature of P407 from 14.05 to 29.7\u2009\u00b0C. The thermal properties of hydrogel revealed two melting point, 54\u201357\u2009\u00b0C and 78\u201381\u2009\u00b0C. The crystallization of hydrogel occurred at temperature lower than 40\u2009\u00b0C and void spaces were presented at the cooling phase of the thermal study. The P407 has a lamellar structure and is stable even when the cPVA was added. The cPVA can be inserted into the interlamellar spacing of P407. It was concluded that a mixture of P407 and cPVA was suitable for the development of hydrogel."}{"Investigation of conductive hybrid polymer composites reinforced with copper micro fibers and carbon nanotubes produced by injection molding ": "Conductive polymeric composites have proved themselves invaluable for novel manufacturing and applications.

Graphitization of hard carbons, using metal catalysts at elevated temperatures, may be an effective method to enhance their crystallinity. In this study, RF xerogels were graphitized using an iron catalyst at a moderate temperature (1100\u202f\u00b0C) in nitrogen atmosphere. Three different catalyst loadings (2, 5, and 10\u202fwt. %) were used to study the extent of graphitization and thereby the effect on physiochemical properties of these RF-derived carbon xerogels. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy revealed an increase in the degree of graphitization and crystallinity, while high-resolution transmission electron micrographs showed an enhancement in the structural ordering of graphene layers with increase in catalyst loading. Interestingly, when tested electrochemically, the 5\u202fwt.% catalyst loaded RF carbon xerogel was found to exhibit the best anodic performance as ever reported. A specific reversible capacity of 470\u202fmA\u202fh/g at 0.2 C rate was retained even after 100 continuous charge/discharge cycles, with nearly 100% columbic efficiency. Furthermore, even at high C-rates (1C), a reasonably high reversible capacity of 348\u202fmA\u202fh/g was maintained during cycling."}{"Shear strength and permeability properties of lateritic soils from North West Malaysia due to extended compaction ": "Lateritic soils are the main source of fill material in development projects in North West Malaysia. In selected projects, for various reasons, quite often the requirements for compaction are extended beyond the normally specified. The extended compaction is thought capable of increasing shear strength and reducing permeability coefficient therefore such measure can be recommended for structures such as building or road subgrade and final cover of a landfill. The current work presents properties associated with shear strength and permeability of 3 lateritic soil samples from local sources, treated solely by compaction with energies ranging from 596 to 3576kJ/m3; for comparison, the standard and modified proctor energies are correspondingly 596 and 2682kJ/m3. The samples were respectively classified as SM, SC, and CH by the USCS method. Increasing the compaction energy by 6 folds from the initial 596kJ/m3 increased maximum dry density by 5 to 15%, increased shear strength under 20kPa normal stress by 82 to 122%, increased shear strength under 40kPa normal stress by 48 to 70%, and reduced permeability coefficient by 40 to 73%. The increased compaction brought significant enhancement to the shear strengths however the reduced permeability coefficients were not sufficient to qualify any of the soils for the specified purpose thus requiring additional form of treatment beside the compaction."}{"High Temperature Isothermal Oxidation Behavior of Superheater Materials ": "During combustion of biomass, alkali chloride-rich ash deposits condense on the surface of superheater tubes, thereby induce corrosion. A well-developed protective oxide layer formed from pre-oxidation treatment is an environmental friendly and cost effective technique for corrosion protection of superheater materials at high temperature in alkali salt environment. The ability of the pre-oxidized layer to protect the alloys depend on the properties such as porosity, thickness, continuity and composition of the layer. The characteristics of the oxide layer could be controlled by proper understanding on the oxidation behaviour of the materials. The main objective of this work is to obtain information on the oxidation behaviour of Hastelloy C22 (C22) and 304 Stainless Steel (304SS) at high temperature environment, hence to justify the suitability of these alloys to be subjected for pre-oxidation treatment. Oxidation of C22 and 304SS was conducted at temperature 900 \u00b0C and 1000 \u00b0C for 24 hours by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The oxide morphology and elemental analysis were characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). The phases of the oxidation products were determined using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The weight change of 304SS is higher as compared to C22 which indicates higher oxidation rate for 304SS. However, the oxide layer formed on Hastelloy C22 is more protective compared to the oxidation products of 304SS. The finding justifies the high potential of C22 alloy to be subjected for pre-oxidation treatment before used as superheater materials for biomass industry."}{"Sintering mechanics of ceramics: a short review ": "The strength and reliability of ceramics is determined by the microstructure and small defects, such as voids and cracks, which are often formed during sintering. The continuum mechanics of sintering is a powerful method to analyze the internal stress developing during the constrained sintering and the formation of these defects. However, challenges remain in understanding microscopic physical mechanisms involved in sintering of powder compacts, the microstructure of which are heterogeneous and anisotropic, generally. Here, we report how the macroscopic sintering stress tensor and the viscosity tensor are determined by microscopic forces acting between particles.

Moreover, the organic dye can be extracted directly from various plants is interesting from the industrial point of view. Recent works related to this field, suggest that different natural dyes sources result in different energy conversion efficiencies. For example, a dye extracted from carrot combined with TiO2 nanoparticle give as high as 0.00124% efficiency, which is considerably low for solar cell application. It was proposed to use Polyaniline (PANI) to increase the thermal stability of this kind of nanocomposites. PANI also provides a broad range of light absorbance, facile to synthesis, and tend to bond with a metal ion. Furthermore, PANI also possesses nice pore morphology and can be blended with another polymer. This work is designed to investigate the performance of TiO2-PANI/ITO with different PANI concentration for solar cell device application. We prepared a TiO2-PANI paste then deposited onto ITO-Glass substrate with 0.25 cm2 active layer. TiO2-PANI/ITO-Glass was sintered at 450 \u00b0C for 1 hour and followed by dip coating process into dye aqueous of \u03b2-Carotene for 24 hours.

In this work, wide band gap semiconductors, ZnS, and aluminium-doped ZnS were synthesized through simply chemical synthetic route with band gap energy of 3.67 \u2013 3.69 eV. The thin films of TiO2/ZnS and TiO2/aluminium-doped ZnS composites with various concentration were prepared by doctor blade technique. By means of X-ray diffraction, the thin film structures of TiO2 is rarely dominated by ZnS or aluminium-doped ZnS. A ruthenium sensitizer (N719) was sensitized on the composited thin films. The absorption and photoluminescence of the composited photoanode were characterized, indicating the band gap energy of 3.41 eV for all thin films. It was observed that both ZnS and aluminium-doped Zns reduce the amount of dye uptake. Also, the photoluminescence of dye sensitized TiO2/ZnS and TiO2/aluminium-doped ZnS photoanode was rather blue-shifted and enhanced with the increasing of ZnS or aluminium-doped ZnS amount. Moreover, using Time Correlated Single Photon Counting technique (TCSPC), the emission lifetimes of dye sensitized TiO2, TiO2/ZnS and TiO2/aluminium-doped ZnS anodes are 3.32 ns, 8.40 ns and 6.42 ns, respectively which indicate the charge injection from excited dye to photoanode."}{"Galvanic corrosion of Ti6Al4V -AA2024 joints in aircraft environment: Modelling and experimental validation ": "This study focuses on the development of a physico-chemical model based on mechanistic and kinetics understanding of the corrosion process in galvanic couple Ti6Al4V-AA2024.

An artificial scribe defect is created in model organic coatings applied to ZAM. Corrosion is initiated using HCl, NaCl, FeCl2 and acetic acid. Only acetic acid is able to reproducibly initiate FFC. The FFC (area) rate is shown to be proportional to the amount of acetic acid introduced. The FFC mechanism is explained in terms of the relative susceptibility of alloy phases to anodic dissolution, determined using scanning electron microscopy and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy."}{"The role of Nb on the high temperature oxidation behavior of CoCrFeMnNbxNi high-entropy alloys ": "The high temperature oxidation behavior of CoCrFeMnNbxNi high-entropy alloys in air was studied. As-cast CoCrFeMnNb0.25Ni alloy is a duplex-phase structure of FCC plus Laves phase. The oxidation kinetics of alloys followed parabolic rate law and the corresponding oxidation rate constants were calculated. In the oxidation process, Nb plays a dual role: On the one hand, the new Laves phase at the oxidation scale/alloy interface hinders the outward diffusion of active metal cations and improves the oxidation resistance; On the other hand, the Laves phase inside the alloy becomes the channel for oxygen ions to diffuse inward and forms internal oxidation."}{"The origin and evolution of copper patina colour ": "The copper patina colour has been systematically explored through a large set of short- and long-term exposed copper metal samples. The initial brown-black appearance is attributed to semiconducting properties of cuprite (Cu2O) and fully attained at thickness 0.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2 \u03bcm. The characteristic green-blue appearance is due to the colour forming Cu(II)-ion in the outer patina layer which needs to be 12\u202f\u00b1\u202f2 \u03bcm to fully cover the inner cuprite layer. No significant influence of atmospheric environment on patina colour is discerned. The green-blue patina colour on historic copper was attained after shorter exposures than in modern copper due to more inhomogeneous microstructure."}{"Influence of KCl and HCl on a laser clad FeCrAl alloy: In-Situ SEM and controlled environment High temperature corrosion ": "This study investigated the effects of HCl and KCl on a laser-clad FeCrAl coating at 450\u202f\u00b0C in an in-situ ESEM followed by a furnace exposure. In all in-situ TEM cross-sections, three major phases were identified: an iron rich oxide, an iron-chromium mixed oxide and an aluminium enriched layer. HCl allowed chlorine based corrosion to occur which suggests interaction from its gas phase. EDX of the regions around KCl crystals showed a decrease in chromium which is an indication of chlorine selectively removing chromium. Moreover, the mass gain in HCl with KCl was significantly lower than that observed in air with KCl."}{"Corrosion properties of 304L stainless steel made by directed energy deposition additive manufacturing ": "The impact of microstructure and processing defects of directed energy deposition (DED) 304L stainless steel on its corrosion behavior was investigated. Materials produced by DED with heat inputs of 0.45 and 0.03\u2009kJ/mm were compared to wrought 304L. Lack of fusion pores in the DED material controlled breakdown potential (Eb) to the first order, reducing it by up to 400\u2009mV versus the base material in 0.6\u2009M NaCl.

Greater fraction of \u03a33n (n\u202f\u2264\u202f3) boundaries and J3-type triple junctions have resulted in better pitting resistance in the optimized GBCD specimen. The presence of higher dislocation density in the deformed specimen has resulted in greater pit generation rate. The fine-grained microstructure has exhibited inferior pitting resistance due to its higher random high angle boundary surface area which serve as preferential sites for nucleation and growth of pits."}{"Mechanically robust superhydrophobic porous anodized AA5083 for marine corrosion protection ": "Given the widely usage and corrosion tendency of AA5083, it is crucial and highly desired to transform intrinsically hydrophilic AA5083 to be water-repellent superhydrophobicity. In this paper, we constructed porous anodized AA5083 and achieved superhydrophobicity by fluorosilane self-assembly. The surface topography, roughness and chemical compositions were investigated by SEM, AFM and XPS. The corrosion-resisting behavior was revealed by EIS, demonstrating prominent improvement of corrosion resistance.

Although the SLM-produced 316L SS possessed superior pitting corrosion resistance and higher hardness, unexpectedly, it has shown lower erosion-corrosion resistance than its conventionally produced commercial counterpart. This behaviour has been related to weaker repassivation ability of the SLM-produced 316L SS mainly due to the presence of the SLM process-induced pores within the specimen."}{"Hot corrosion behaviour of wire-arc additive manufactured Ni-based superalloy ATI 718Plus\u00ae\n             ": "The hot corrosion behaviour of wire-arc additive manufactured and wrought ATI 718Plus\u00ae are studied. ATI 718Plus\u00ae produced by the additive manufacturing process, in the as-processed condition, exhibits a significantly lower hot corrosion resistance in comparison to the wrought alloy. Analytical electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, with corroboration by thermodynamic calculations, are used to identify the underlying cause of the poor hot corrosion resistance. Based on the understanding accrued from the analyses, post-processing heat treatments are used to improve the hot corrosion resistance, which is valuably pertinent to the application of ATI 718Plus\u00ae produced by additive manufacturing in hot corrosive environments."}{"Kinetics of corrosion-driven cathodic disbondment on organic coated trivalent chromium metal-oxide-carbide coatings on steel ": "Chromium metal-oxide-carbide coatings of varying composition and thickness, cathodically electrodeposited from a Cr (III)-formate electrolyte are compared for their ability to resist the corrosion driven delamination of an adherent polymer overcoat. Cathodic disbondment rates are determined using an in-situ scanning Kelvin probe technique. The rates of cathodic disbondment decreased with increasing thickness and Cr (III) oxide content of the Cr (III) derived coating. Disbondment kinetics are explained in terms of coating porosity, chemical composition and electrocatalytic activity of the various metallic surfaces for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Diminished electrocatalytic activity for ORR, as determined from cathodic polarisation measurements with a rotating disk electrode, are found to correlate with diminished delamination kinetics."}{"In-situ intercalation of 8-hydroxyquinoline in Mg-Al LDH coating to improve the corrosion resistance of AZ31 ": "Mg-Al based layered double hydroxide (LDH) coating intercalated with 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) was successfully prepared on AZ31. The influence of concentrations of 8HQ on the morphology and corrosion resistance is reported first time. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra confirm the intercalation of 8HQ. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals concentration dependence of morphology of LDH. The enhancement in corrosion resistance is a function of morphological change, adsorption of 8HQ and chelation with Mg2+. The optimum amount of 8HQ enhances corrosion resistance of LDH coating. The deductions of this study deliver valuable understandings of corrosion protection mechanism of Mg-Al-LDH coatings."}{"Catastrophic stress corrosion failure of Zr-base bulk metallic glass through hydrogen embrittlement ": "Zr-base bulk metallic glasses (BMG) are prone to pitting corrosion in halide containing solutions and also stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is often interpreted in this context. This work presents in situ SCC experiments on notched Zr52.5Cu17.9Ni14.6Al10Ti5 (at.%) BMG bars under 3-point bending in dilute NaCl solution. They show that pitting corrosion is only the initiating process. The pitted areas have a lower local corrosion potential and the reaction of Zr4+ to zirconyl ions in solution produces H+ that can be reduced and absorbed in the local acidic environment. So, hydrogen embrittlement causes the observed catastrophic failure and peculiar fracture surface characteristics."}{"Effect of post-treatment on the microstructure and high-temperature oxidation behaviour of additively manufactured inconel 718 alloy ": "The effect of solution ageing and hot isostatic pressing treatments on the high-temperature (900, 1000\u202f\u00b0C) oxidation of selective laser melted Inconel 718 alloy was studied. Oxidation results showed improved oxidation resistance after HIP treatment, attributed to higher density of the HIP sample and microstructural differences at the grain boundaries. Cations diffused along the grain boundary in SA alloy, while Ti-rich carbides retarded grain boundary diffusion in HIPed alloy. In SA alloy, the \u03b3\u201d and \u03b4 phases were observed within the grain, and at the molten pool boundary, respectively. In HIPed alloy, discontinuous MC were observed, along with fine \u03b3\u2019 phases."}{"Effect of \u03b4-ferrite on the stress corrosion cracking behavior of 321 stainless steel ": "The stress corrosion cracking behavior of 321 stainless steel has been studied in high temperature water. Analytical electron microscopy was utilized to characterize the cracking process to better understand the \u03b4-ferrite effect. Results showed that \u03b4-ferrite inhibited the crack growth by changing the cracking direction along the \u03b3/\u03b4 boundary and creating a highly branched crack path. \u03b4-ferrite was also a source of Cr to facilitate the formation of protective Cr-rich oxides at the \u03b3/\u03b4 boundaries. Ti(CN) particles in the \u03b3/\u03b4 boundary tended to blunt the crack tip and inhibit further oxidation, and thus impeded the total crack growth."}{"Simultaneous improvement in corrosion resistance and hardness of a model 2xxx series Al-Cu alloy with the microstructural variation caused by Sc and Zr additions ": "The microstructural variation caused by Sc and Zr additions to a 2xxx series Al-Cu alloy was studied in the context of corrosion and hardness. The addition of Sc and Zr led to microstructural refinement, a decrease in corrosion current density, and a reduction in the extent of pitting and intergranular corrosion; whilst hardness increased. Such an improvement in properties was attributed to the variation of alloy microstructure. It was also noted that an often unreported W-phase (AlxCu5-6ScZry\u22480.3), containing Zr, was \u2018cathodic\u2019 relative to the Al-matrix in the Al-Cu-Sc-Zr alloy."}{"Influence of the microstructure on the corrosion behaviour of cast Mg-Al alloys ": "The influence of \u03b1-phase and \u03b2-phase (Mg17Al12) on corrosion of cast binary Mg-Al alloys was investigated by immersion testing in 5\u2009wt.-% NaCl solution saturated with Mg(OH)2 and by measuring the corrosion potential Ecorr. The microstructure of the alloys regarding Al-content of \u03b1-phase and amount of \u03b2-phase was adjusted by solution heat treatments at various temperatures. Subsequently the continuity of \u03b2-phase (C\u03b2) was measured. With increasing Al-content in the \u03b1-phase, the impact of C\u03b2 decreases.

Fiber kinking is especially prevalent in laminates with holes and cutouts. The latter behavior is characterized by strain localization in the matrix material and fiber rotations. To study fiber kinking on the level of the individual constituents, a homogenization of fiber composites is presented. It is based on a total Lagrangian formulation, making it independent of fiber rotations. It accounts for the microstructure of the composite, including fiber-matrix interfacial decohesion, and enables all types of material behavior of the constituents. The response of each constituent of the composite is modeled separately and the global response is obtained by an assembly of all contributions. The model is implemented as a user-defined material model (UMAT) in ABAQUS and used for multiscale modeling of notched unidirectional plies subjected to compression. The model performs well in agreement with a finite element model of an explicit discretization of the microstructure and literature results. The simulations predict the formation of a kink band in near 0-degree plies and show that the open-hole compression strength is sensitive to fiber-matrix interfacial decohesion.

The corresponding specific shielding effectiveness 890\u202fdB\u202fcm2\u202fg\u22121 is particularly high among biodegradable shielding materials. The outstanding performance is due to scattering and thus increased propagation distance of electromagnetic waves in the multiphase composite medium.

Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative of conventional processes for the fabrication of CFRTPCs due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. The mechanical properties of a built part depend on several process parameters. The aim of this study is to characterize the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and fibre volume content on the mechanical performance of 3D printed continuous fibre reinforced composites components manufactured by a desktop 3D printer. Tensile and three-point bending tests are carried out to determine the mechanical response of the printed specimens. SEM images of fractured surfaces are evaluated to determine the effects of process parameters on failure modes.\n                  It is observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the mechanical performance is marginally significant. In addition, continuous fibre reinforced samples show higher strength and stiffness values than unreinforced ones. The results show that carbon fibre reinforced composites exhibit the best mechanical performance with higher stiffness and flat samples exhibit higher values of strength and stiffness than on-edge samples. Additionally, the results show that strength and stiffness increase as fibre volume content increases in most cases but, conversely, the level of increment in mechanical performance is moderate with continued rise in fibre content, particularly in the case of Kevlar\u00ae and glass fibres, due to weak bonding between the fibre/nylon layers as well as the presence of increased levels of defects. Finally, the practicality of the results is assessed by testing an evaluation structure."}{"Mechanical and physical performance of carbon aerogel reinforced carbon fibre hierarchical composites ": "Carbon aerogel (CAG) is a potential hierarchical reinforcement to improve the matrix-dominated mechanical properties of continuous carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites in both multifunctional and purely structural applications. When using CAG to reinforce a polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) matrix, the interlaminar shear strength, compressive modulus and strength increased approximately four-fold, whilst the out-of-plane electrical conductivity increased by 118%. These mechanical and electrical performance enhancements significantly improve the multifunctional efficiency of composite structural supercapacitors, which can offer weight savings in transport and other applications. However, CAG also has the potential to reinforce conventional continuous CF composites in purely structural contexts. Here, CAG reinforcement of structural epoxy resin composites marginally increased compressive (1.4%) and tensile (2.7%) moduli respectively, but considerably reduced compressive, tensile and interlaminar shear strengths. Fractographic analysis shows that the reduced performance can be attributed to poor interfacial adhesion; in the future, alternative processing routes may resolve these issues to achieve advances in both moduli and strengths over conventional structural CFRPs."}{"Flexible, stretchable and electrically conductive MXene/natural rubber nanocomposite films for efficient electromagnetic interference shielding ": "The rapid popularity of portable and wearable electronics requires high-performance flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials to cope with increasingly severe electromagnetic wave pollution problems. To combine outstanding EMI shielding performance and excellent mechanical flexibility, we demonstrate an efficient vacuum-assisted filtration approach for the fabrication of flexible and highly conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene/natural rubber (NR) nanocomposite films by constructing interconnected MXene networks in NR matrix. The electrostatic repulsion forces originated from the negative charges of MXene and NR latex enable the MXene sheets to selectively distribute at the interfaces of the NR particles, forming an interconnected network for efficient electron transport and load transfer at low MXene contents. The resultant nanocomposite with 6.71\u202fvol% of MXene shows a superb electrical conductivity of 1400\u202fS\u202fm\u22121 and an outstanding EMI shielding performance of 53.6\u202fdB. Furthermore, the robust and three-dimensional MXene network provides significant reinforcement to the NR matrix, exhibiting obviously enhanced tensile strength and modulus by 700% and 15000% as compared to those of neat NR, respectively. The stable EMI shielding capability and stretchability under cyclic deformations make the high-performance MXene/NR nanocomposite films promise in next-generation flexible and foldable electronics."}{"Thermal conductivity of highly filled polymer nanocomposites ": "A model is developed for the effective thermal conductivity of composites with polymer matrices reinforced with randomly distributed micro- and nano-particles. The model takes into account formation of infinite conducting paths and finite aggregates of particles on the one hand, and thermal barriers at the interfaces between the matrix and filler, on the other. Material parameters are determined by matching observations on a number of composites with ceramic and carbon fillers. The intensity of thermal barriers is evaluated by means of the Kapitza radius. Comparison of experimental data with results of simulation demonstrate that this parameter is determined by filler only, and it is weakly affected by the matrix material."}{"Hybrid poly(ether ether ketone) composites reinforced with a combination of carbon fibres and graphene nanoplatelets ": "Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK), with its superb mechanical properties, excellent chemical resistance and high thermo-oxidative stability is one of the most important engineering thermoplastics for high-end applications. In this work, we investigate the elastic and viscoelastic properties along with the creep mitigation of two sets of samples: PEEK reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and PEEK reinforced with a hybrid graphene/short carbon fibre (CF) filler. The melt viscosity of the PEEK nanocomposites was found to increase with increasing GNPs content; however, the viscosity of the hybrid CF-GNP samples with the highest filler content was equal to the one of the samples filled only with GNPs at low shear rates. This processability shows the advantage of GNPs over other nano and conventional fillers in the ability to use meaningful loadings. The introduction of GNPs improved significantly the stiffness and the storage modulus of the materials in both PEEK-GNP and PEEK-CF-GNP composites. Moreover, the presence of GNPs within the composites led to a restriction of the mobility of the macromolecular chains of PEEK, which resulted in enhanced creep properties at both room temperature and elevated temperatures. Overall, the nanocomposites produced displayed properties that make them attractive in applications where high stiffness and structural integrity at elevated temperatures are required."}{"Compressive strength assessment of fibre composites based on a defect severity model ": "This paper presents a defect severity concept for characterising fibre misalignments commonly found in practical composites. Drawing an analogy with brittle fracture from sharp defects, we show that compressive failure is governed by regions with clusters of misaligned fibres and that failure occurs from a critical region most favourable to initiating a kink-band. Based on a large database of measured fibre misalignments, a defect severity model is proposed. The initiation and progression of kink-bands are also analysed using a finite element model."}{"Light-weight and flexible silicone rubber/MWCNTs/Fe3O4 nanocomposite foams for efficient electromagnetic interference shielding and microwave absorption ": "Light-weight and flexible methyl vinyl silicon rubber (VMQ)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/ferriferrous oxide (Fe3O4) nanocomposite foams with efficient electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance were firstly prepared by supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO2) foaming process. The microwave-absorbing ability of the VMQ/MWCNTs/Fe3O4 foams has been greatly improved owing to the existence of cellular structure and magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles, thus significantly reducing the secondary EM wave pollution caused by reflection. These nanocomposite foams with density of \u223c0.48\u202fg\u22121\u202fcm3 exhibited an EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of 27.5\u202fdB, and its average absorption ratio can reach up to 64% in the frequency range of 8.2\u201312.4\u202fGHz. Such highly conductive (\u223c14.6\u202fS/m) and specific EMI SE (\u223c72\u202fdB\u00b7g\u22121cm3) can be obtained with filler loading of 1.78\u202fvol%. Moreover, the flexible silicone rubber foams present excellent EMI shielding stability after repeated bending. The shielding mechanism of the composite foams was also discussed, and the results show that the main shielding mechanism of the foams was absorption with the addition of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Furthermore, the foams exhibits excellent superparamagnetic and thermal properties, the maximum onset decomposition temperature can reach 467\u202f\u00b0C. In view of the uncomplicated, low-cost and environmental protection preparation procedure, the light-weight, flexible, magnetic and highly conductive silicone rubber nanocomposite foams are expected to be used in lightweight and flexible electromagnetic shielding materials."}{"Amorphous-silicon nanoshell on artificial graphite composite as the anode for lithium-ion battery ": "The fabrication of uniform amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanoshell on graphite is recognized as a high energy technique for building block into macroscopic materials. Here in, various thick containing nanoscaled A-Si nanoshells could easily be adjusted by controlling the preparation conditions.

Appropriate amount of CH3COONa was introduced into the synthesis process to supply a moderate alkaline condition and slowly accelerate hydrolysis of ZnSO4 and FeCl3. The structure, morphology and photoelectric properties of samples were analyzed, and the results indicated that the as-synthesized samples with octahedral-like morphology and superior light absorption characteristics were assembled of ZnO and ZnFe2O4 crystallites as well as dispersed in various orientations.

The degradation process agreed well with pseudo-first-order kinetics. The improved photocatalytic activity was attributed to the synergetic effect of low bandgap energy, mesoporous structure and efficient charge separation, which enhanced the visible-light utilization and adsorption of pollutants."}{"Electrospinning synthesis of porous carbon fiber supported Pt-SnO2 anode catalyst for direct ethanol fuel cell ": "Pt-SnO2 catalysts supported on modified carbon fibers were prepared by an electrospinning method with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as the carrier and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the pore-forming agent. The physical-chemical property and catalytic performance of the as-synthesized composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, Chronoamperometry and AC impedance. The results showed that the porous structure in the carbon fibers was formed after calcination at 800\u202f\u00b0C in the presence of PVDF. When the weight ratio of PAN/PVDF was 1:0.8, the porous carbon fibers had the largest surface area of 374.85\u202fm2\u202fg\u22121, which was 3.3 times of carbon fibers prepared without PVDF.

To solve the above problems, we fabricated a composite interlayer for Li/S batteries using ZnO nanocrystals anchored on connected carbon nanotube and graphene. The preparation of ZnO/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide (ZnO/CNT/RGO) composite film was inspired from the combination of a one-step sol-gel synthetic technique and vacuum-assisted filtration. The ZnO/CNT/RGO interlayer showed effective adsorption of polysulfides during diffusion experiments. This ZnO/CNT/RGO interlayer can efficiently increase sulfur utilization by immobilizing soluble intermediate polysulfides.

Photocatalytic behavior of prepared samples was studied by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under both visible and ultra-violet (UV) region. XRD results indicated that phase structures of photocatalyst were the mixture of anatase and rutile phases. The content of the anatase phase increased to a maximum of 72\u202fwt% in Fe doped TiO2 nanopowder. The agglomeration of Cu doped TiO2 particles was more severe than that of other samples. The average particle size of the Fe doped TiO2 samples was 120\u202fnm smaller than that of the Cu doped sample. XRD, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and TEM results confirmed the more uniform dispersion and replacement of Ti by Fe in the TiO2 lattice structure. The results from DRS analysis obviously showed the shift of absorption band gap towards the visible region upon doping TiO2 with both Cu and Fe, with the minimum value of 2.8\u202feV for Fe doped TiO2. PL results showed that Fe doped sample had lower electron-hole recombination rate than other TiO2 samples.

We adopt the generalized gradient approximation designed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) for the exchange-correlation energy. The obtained structural parameters are agreement with the experimental values. The elastic and phonon properties were derived to discuss their stability in mechanical and dynamical. Mechanical properties were deduced within the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation. The brittleness and ductility are estimated by the values of Poisson's ratio and Pugh's rule (B/G).

To this aim, we propose a thorough study of a double heterostructure system consisting of two semiconductors with large band gap, namely, wurtzite ZnO and anatase TiO2. We demonstrate via first-principle calculations two stable configurations of ZnO/TiO2 interfaces. Our structural analysis provides a key information on the nature of the complex interface and lattice distortions occurring when combining these materials. The study of the electronic properties of the sandwich nanostructure TiO2/ZnO/TiO2 reveals that conduction band arises mainly from Ti3\n                     \n                        d\n                      orbitals, while valence band is maintained by O2\n                     \n                        p\n                      of ZnO, and that the trapped states within the gap region frequent in single heterostructure are substantially reduced in the double interface system.

This improvement is due to the ability of the graphene layers to transfer their exceptional strength to the metallic matrix, and their ability to hinder the propagation of dislocations inside the metallic systems. In these composites, the structure of the graphene layer (or nanoparticles) in the matrix and the interaction between graphene and metallic atoms play a vital role in the improvement of metal-graphene composites\u2019 mechanical properties. While the interaction between metal and graphene interface, when the graphene is on the top of a metallic layer, has been extensively studied, details of the interaction when the graphene is embedded inside a metal matrix are still highly unexplored. In this paper, we considered the structure of graphene and the interaction between graphene nanoparticle edges and nickel atoms when the graphene is embedded in the nickel matrix. Using ab-initio calculations, we found that when the graphene is embedded inside a nickel matrix, the most stable graphene structure is topfcc (with graphene nano-sheets being parallel to Ni(111) surface), which is a different configuration compared to the case of having graphene on the surface of a nickel slab. Also, we found that armchair edge energy is 0.8022(eV/\u00c5) and zigzag edge energy is 2.5048(eV/\u00c5) which implies armchair edge is more stable and creates less distortion inside the nickel matrix. Less distortion by armchair edge implies that nucleation of dislocation in composites will start later at armchair edges in comparison to zigzag edges during mechanical loading."}{"Surface energies, adhesion energies, and exfoliation energies relevant to copper-graphene and copper-graphite systems ": "We have generated precise values for several key energies that are relevant to Cu-graphene or Cu-graphite systems. Such systems may find technological applications that range from graphene synthesis, to condensation heat transfer, to electrical contacts to graphene, to composites. Using density functional theory, we have calculated surface energies of the three low-index faces of bulk Cu.

We have also calculated the surface energies of graphene and graphite, the exfoliation energy between graphene and graphite, and the adhesion energies between graphene or graphite and a Cu(111) slab. The adhesion energy between a carbon layer and Cu(111) is close to the exfoliation energy and cleavage energy of graphite, the four sets of values spanning a range of only 0.394\u20130.456\u202fJ/m2.

We show how understanding and tracking different types of uncertainties in the experimental and simulation methods, as well as the machine learning framework for the generative model, is crucial for controlling and improving the fidelity in the predictive design of battery interfaces and interphases. We argue that simultaneous utilization of data from multiple domains, including data from failed experiments, will play a critical role in accelerating the development of reliable generative models to enable accelerated discovery and inverse design of durable ultra high performance batteries based on novel materials, structures and designs."}{"Recent progress and perspectives on aqueous Zn-based rechargeable batteries with mild aqueous electrolytes ": "Aqueous rechargeable batteries are regarded as one of the ultimate solutions needed to solve the safety problems of conventional rechargeable batteries using organic electrolytes, but the challenge is to find suitable anode materials that will work well in the narrow electrochemical window of water with reasonable capacities. Aqueous Zn-based rechargeable batteries using Zn anode, a mild aqueous electrolyte, and Zn2+ or another monovalent/multivalent metal ion as charge carrier have been receiving extensive attention in recent years due to their low cost, high safety, environmental friendliness, and acceptable energy density. Although it is still a challenge to achieve high performance aqueous Zn-based rechargeable batteries with a long cycle life and a high energy density, considerable efforts have been devoted to overcoming the drawbacks associated with the Zn anode, electrolyte, and cathode materials. In this review, the recent advances on the aqueous Zn-based rechargeable batteries, including aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) and aqueous Zn hybrid batteries (AZHBs), are systematically reviewed. We first summarize and discuss the Zn anode behaviour and strategies to restrain the dendrite formation and improve the plating/stripping efficiency. Then, the cathode materials used in AZIBs and AZHBs are summarized in terms of their structures, electrochemical performance, and reaction mechanism, as well as the strategies used to improve their electrochemical performance. The electrolytes and their effects on the electrochemical performance of Zn anode and cathode materials are also discussed. Finally, the challenges for and perspectives on AZIBs and AZHBs are summarized to guide research directions in the future."}{"Safety issues and mechanisms of lithium-ion battery cell upon mechanical abusive loading: A review ": "Battery safety has attracted attention worldwide due to current trends in communication and mobilization brought about by rapidly evolving versions of smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other electronic devices, as well as the continuing increase in the number of electric vehicles. Mechanical abuse condition is one of the most critical scenarios with possible catastrophic results, such as fire or explosion of lithium-ion batteries. This comprehensive review aims to describe the complete mechanical\u2013electrochemical\u2013thermal coupled behavior of lithium-ion batteries through a review of experimental, theoretical, and modeling studies in each battery evolution phase under mechanical abuse loading.

Intense research efforts have been made to solve the outstanding issues in Li-S batteries. Various catalysts with high activity for stabilizing the lithium-polysulfide shuttle process and thus improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries are reviewed here. Challenges and prospects for designing highly efficient catalysts for Li-S batteries are discussed."}{"MXene-conducting polymer electrochromic microsupercapacitors ": "Solution processable two-dimensional transition metal carbides, commonly known as MXenes, have drawn much interest due to their diverse optoelectronic, electrochemical and other useful properties. These properties have been exploited to develop thin and optically transparent microsupercapacitors. However, color changing MXene-based microsupercapacitors have not been explored. In this study, we developed titanium carbide-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) heterostructures by electrochemical deposition using a non-aqueous monomeric electrolytic bath. Planar electrodes of such hybrid films were carved directly using an automated scalpel technique. Hybrid microsupercapacitors showed five-fold areal capacitance and higher rate capabilities (2.4\u202fmF\u202fcm\u22122 at 10\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121, retaining 1.4\u202fmF\u202fcm\u22122 at 1000\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121) over the pristine MXene microsupercapacitors (455\u202f\u03bcF\u202fcm\u22122 at 10\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121, 120\u202f\u03bcF\u202fcm\u22122 at 1000\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121). Furthermore, the electrochromic behavior of PEDOT/Ti3C2Tx microsupercapacitors was investigated using in-situ UV\u2013vis and resonant Raman spectroscopies. A high-rate color switch between a deep blue and colorless state is achieved on both electrodes in the voltage range of \u22120.6 to 0.6\u202fV, with switching times of 6.4 and 5.5\u202fs for bleaching and coloration, respectively.

Metal sulfide electrodes, which can meet the need of new energy materials, are one of the most representative candidates in energy devices. Here, a universal method is developed to in-situ grow a series of battery-type metal sulfide core-shell nanoneedle films (i.e., Co9S8-MoS2, Co9S8-NiS2, Co9S8-NiCo2S4, NiCo2S4-CuS, NiCo2S4-NiS2, and NiCo2S4-MoS2) on carbon cloth. When served as active materials in electrochemical tests, the Co9S8-NiCo2S4 electrode shows superior energy storage ability with a specific capacity of 337.78 mAh g-1 at 1\u202fA\u202fg-1 and a retention rate of 93% undergoing 5000 cycles at 10\u202fA\u202fg-1. Subsequently, the Co9S8-NiCo2S4 electrode is assembled into a flexible all-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor, which delivers a maximum specific energy of 56.44\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg-1 at 795\u202fW\u202fkg-1 and a maximum specific power of 8153\u202fW\u202fkg-1 at 29.44\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg-1.

Here, an in-situ electrochemical approach has been developed for the activation of MnO by inducing Mn-defect, wherein the Mn defects are formed through a charge process that converts the MnO with poor electrochemical activities towards Zn2+ into high electrochemically active cathode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). More importantly, this cathode exhibits an insertion/extraction mechanism without structural collapse during storage/release of Zn2+. The as-designed Zn/MnO battery delivers a high energy density of 383.88\u202fWh kg\u22121 at a power density of 135.6\u202fW\u202fkg\u22121. The results demonstrate that the Mn-defect MnO would be a promising cathode for aqueous ZIBs, which is expected to be used in commercial large-scale energy storage. This work may pave the way for the possibility of using defect chemistry to introduce novel properties in electrode materials for high-performance aqueous ZIBs."}{"Stabilized lithium metal anode by an efficient coating for high-performance Li\u2013S batteries ": "Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are one of the most promising energy storage candidates substituted for traditional Li-ion batteries due to their high energy density and natural abundance of sulfur. However, Li metal anode is prone to react with soluble polysulfide produced during the charge/discharge process, leading to the loss of active materials, corrosion of Li metal and fast cell capacity decay. Besides, Li metal anode is also confronted with Li dendrite growth related serious safety concerns. Here, a conformal thin layer of Sn is coated on Li metal surface, which could protect Li metal anode from the parasitic reactions, accommodate the huge volume change and suppress dendritic lithium growth. The symmetric cell using Li foil with Sn coating demonstrates excellent cycling performance with low voltage polarization and uniform, dense and dendrite-free electrodeposited Li metal. In addition, LSBs with Sn coated Li metal anode shows a high specific capacity (1423.7 mAh g\u22121 at 0.2\u202fC), good rate performance and stable cycling performance with a high Coulombic efficiency of ~99.5% for 500 cycles at 2\u202fC. The superior electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to the Sn protective layer which could enable the fast Li+ transport at the electrode/electrolyte interface, the suppression of Li dendrite growth and the effective minimization of active sulfur loss. This work provides a novel approach and a significant step towards cost-effective, large-scalable and long-cycling stable LSBs."}{"Understanding and improving the initial Coulombic efficiency of high-capacity anode materials for practical sodium ion batteries ": "Sodium ion batteries have emerged as a potential low-cost candidate for energy storage systems due to the earth abundance and availability of Na resource. With the exploitation of high-performance electrode materials and in-depth mechanism investigation, the electrochemical properties of sodium ion batteries have been greatly improved. However, there are still various challenges need to be overcome before its commercial application. Among them, the low initial Coulombic efficiency of high-capacity anode is a critical issue that seriously limits the practical energy density of sodium ion full battery. This review firstly highlights the underlying mechanisms of the low initial Coulombic efficiency, such as the formation of SEI film from the decomposition of electrolyte, poor reversibility of sodiation/desodiation process, etc., and then summarizes the emerging strategies including electrolyte optimization, structure/morphology design, surface engineering, binder optimization and so on, to overcome them. Finally, some Na compensation strategies like pre-sodiated anode, sacrificial additives and sodium-rich cathode for practical application are discussed. This review provides pertinent insights into the challenges of initial Coulombic efficiency for the development of high energy sodium ion battery, which will benefit to its practical application."}{"Mechanical design and multifunctional applications of chiral mechanical metamaterials: A review ": "Rational design of artificial micro-structured metamaterials with advanced mechanical and physical properties that are not accessible in nature materials is challenging and important. In our paper, mechanical designs of 2D and 3D chiral mechanical metamaterials are reviewed, and their mechanical behaviors and deformation mechanisms can be investigated through equilibrium principle, strain energy analysis, micropolar elasticity and homogenization theories. Afterwards, multifunctional properties of chiral mechanical metamaterials are elaborated, such as: vibration attenuation, impact energy absorption and negative coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Finally, several successful industrial applications of chiral mechanical metamaterials are demonstrated, such as: morphing airfoil smart deployable antenna and reconfigurable structures, auxetic stent, chiral flexible electronics and phase transforming metastructures, etc. Finally, perspectives and challenges on chiral mechanical metamaterials are discussed."}{"Mechanical properties of 3D printed polymeric Gyroid cellular structures: Experimental and finite element study ": "Gyroid is a member of the triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) family. In this paper, the mechanical properties of Gyroid-structures are investigated both experimentally and computationally. 3D printing is used to fabricate polymeric Gyroid-structure specimens made of PA 2200 at different relative densities. In the finite element analysis, the Arruda-Boyce finite-deformation elasto-viscoplastic model is employed. To perform the finite element analysis, the properties of the 3D printed material are determined by a series of tension and compression tests. The finite element results of the Gyroid-structure agree very well with the experimental data. Also, the uniaxial modulus, compressive strength, and energy absorption of the Gyroid-structures are compared with those of the IWP-, Neovius-, and Primitive-structures from a previous study. The comparison shows that Gyroid-structures have relatively good mechanical properties and compete well with the other TPMS cellular structures."}{"Review on design and structural optimisation in additive manufacturing: Towards next-generation lightweight structures ": "As the application of additive manufacturing (AM) reaches an unprecedented scale in both academia and industry, a reflection upon the state-of-the-art developments in the design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) and structural optimisation, becomes vital for successfully shaping the future AM-landscape. A framework, highlighting both the interdependencies between these two central aspects in AM and the necessity for a holistic approach to structural optimization, using lightweight strategies such as topology optimization and/or latticing, was established to summarize the reviewed content. Primarily focusing on isotropic material considerations and basic stiffness-optimal problems, these concepts have already found wide application, bridging the gaps between design and manufacturing as well as academia and industry. In pursuit of streamlining the AM-workflow towards digitally print-ready designs, studies are increasingly investigating mathematically-based structural optimization approaches in conjunction with DfAM-specific constraints, providing a portfolio of solutions like generative design, which is gaining traction in industry. Besides an overview on economically-driven to performance-driven design optimizations, insight into commercial AM-specific software is provided, elucidating potentials and challenges for the community. Despite the abundance of AM design methods to-date, computationally inexpensive solutions for common engineering problems are still scarce, which is constituting one of many key challenges for the future."}{"Microstructure of selective laser melted AlSi10Mg alloy ": "The influence of laser power during selective laser melting (SLM) on the grain morphology and texture component in AlSi10Mg alloy has been investigated, using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). Both equiaxed and columnar grains were observed. The formation of equiaxed grains was attributed to the huge thermal gradient on the border of melt pool and the columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) occurred in front of the columnar grains. The grain size of low laser power sample was found smaller than that of higher ones. A fine pseudoeutectic structure, in which Si existed as fibrous, was observed because of the high cooling rate. This paper, from a new angle, explained the formations of three different zones across the melt pool, which were differentiated by the morphology of Si phase. The three zones correspond to the three temperature zones, which were divided by liquidus and solidus temperature, during the heating by laser beam. The coarse zones are formed by reheating the basic metal to semi-solid state when the temperature is lower than the liquidus temperature but higher than the solidus temperature."}{"SLM lattice structures: Properties, performance, applications and challenges ": "Additive manufacturing (AM), particularly Selective Laser Melting (SLM) has enabled development of lattice structures with unique properties. Through control of various parameters lattice structures can produce unique mechanical, electrical, thermal and acoustic properties, and have received much research attention. Despite the increasing volume of published data on the mechanical response of specific SLM lattice structures, there exists no overarching analysis. This work addresses this identified deficiency by providing a comprehensive summary of the experimental data reported on the mechanical response of SLM lattice structures. The design, fabrication and performance of SLM lattice structures are reviewed and the quality of data reported is analysed to inform best-practice for future studies. This comprehensive data summary enables meta-analysis of the reported mechanical performance of SLM lattice structures, providing insight into the bounds of their technical capabilities. Correlations were identified between the relative density and mechanical properties of many unit cell topologies consistent with the predictions of the Gibson-Ashby model, indicating its usefulness in describing and predicting the behaviour of SLM lattice structures. This review provides designers with a compiled resource of experimental data and design for AM tools to inform future design applications of SLM lattice structures and facilitates their further commercial adoption."}{"Design and impact response of 3D-printable tensegrity-inspired structures ": "Recent studies demonstrate the potential of tensegrity structures as unique building blocks for architected lattices (metamaterials). Key tensegrity characteristics, such as elastic response under severe deformation, high strength-to-weight ratio, and nonlinear behavior, make these structures appealing for dynamic applications. A new method of tessellating tensegrity unit cells with elastically buckling struts in three dimensions has opened new avenues for metamaterials with superior mechanical properties. However, traditional fabrication methods for tensegrity structures are cumbersome and do not allow accurate control of the level of member prestress. To overcome these limitations, we present a design of a 3D-printable, single material structure which has comparable strain energy capacity and compressive response as a tensegrity structure with buckling struts. The structure's geometry maintains key tensegrity characteristics, thus generating an equivalent mechanical response. Numerical simulations inform quasi-static compression experiments and dynamic drop weight impact tests. The structure's responses correspond well to the pin-jointed tensegrity, exhibiting desirable characteristics such as post-buckling stability, resilience under severe deformation, high elastic strain energy absorption, and load-limitation. This work is the first to experimentally corroborate theoretical studies of buckling tensegrity structures. We conjecture that the structure presented here has unique potential as a unit cell for manufacturable tensegrity-inspired metamaterials."}{"A review of experimental approaches to fracture toughness evaluation at the micro-scale ": "The discipline of fracture mechanics was born almost a century ago through the pioneering work of A.A. Griffith, and saw particularly rapid growth in the second half of 20th century when it became an indispensable tool in the development of advanced transportation, civil construction, and energy systems. Forty years ago, Materials & Design published a series of papers devoted to the state-of-the-art in the field of Fracture Mechanics. The present review reflects the lasting legacy and surviving importance of this theme: it is associated with the Virtual Special Issue on nanoscale materials testing and characterisation, and focuses on the modern experimental approaches to fine scale fracture toughness evaluation, with particular emphasis on micro-cantilever bending and micro-pillar splitting. The fundamental aspects of these approaches are overviewed, and their application to a range of systems is described. Implications for further development of these methods are discussed."}{"Evaluation of solidification cracking susceptibility during laser welding in advanced high strength automotive steels ": "Solidification cracking susceptibility during laser welding was studied experimentally and numerically in advanced high strength steel sheets, namely transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and dual phase (DP) steel. Using the same heat input, laser bead-on-plate welding was carried out on single sided clamped specimens at various starting distances from the free edge. It was observed that TRIP steel with high phosphorus is susceptible to cracking while in DP steel with low phosphorus, solidification cracking was not observed. The metallurgical factors affecting the solidification cracking were studied and it was found that solidification morphology, phosphorus segregation at the prior austenite grain boundaries, inclusions, interface growth rate and interdendritic liquid feeding have a prominent effect on the strength of the mushy zone. These results are discussed pertaining to the cracking mechanism. For the same welding parameters, a difference in the weld pool shape was observed in both the steels, which is attributed to the high temperature thermophysical properties. Weld pool shape affects the strain distribution in the mushy region and thus the cracking behaviour. The cracking phenomenon is further described using hot ductility curves."}{"Development of 3D printable engineered cementitious composites with ultra-high tensile ductility for digital construction ": "The current 3D concrete printing (3DCP) technology is limited by the reinforcing methods. Conventional steel reinforcement is hard to be incorporated in the 3DCP process. To overcome this limitation, this study aims to develop 3D-printable engineered cementitious composites (ECCs) exhibiting ultra-high tensile strain capacity of more than 8%, which can be used for digital construction of \u2018self-reinforced\u2019 concrete structures, reducing the reliance on the conventional steel reinforcement. Different volume fractions of polyethylene fibers (1%, 1.5% and 2%) were used to reinforce the ECC matrix. The fresh properties (including the workability, rheological properties and buildability) and the hardened properties (including the compressive and flexural strengths, and the uniaxial tensile performance), along with the microstructure of the developed 3D printable ECCs were experimentally investigated. Conventionally mold-cast ECCs were also prepared and tested for comparison purposes. The results showed that the developed 3D printable PE-ECCs exhibited strong strain-hardening behavior with the tensile strength and tensile strain capacity of up to 5.7\u202fMPa and 11.4%, respectively. In addition, the results showed that the 3D printed PE-ECCs exhibited superior tensile performance to the conventionally mold-cast PE-ECC counterparts. This finding is in good agreement with the results of the microstructural analysis."}{"Design for 4D printing: A voxel-based modeling and simulation of smart materials ": "In the wake of the breakthrough being by additive manufacturing (AM), there is another rapidly growing manufacturing progress: 4D printing (4DP). It is basically AM with, inter alia, smart materials (SMs). Owing to the stimulus-responsive behaviors of these materials, the parts so manufactured are imbued with the ability to change. 4DP is being given huge research efforts regarding its manufacturing aspects. However so little is made to let designers explore the so uncovered design space. Compared to DFAM, what could be called Design for 4D printing (DF4DP) does lag far behind. In this article, a modeling framework for simulating SMs and conventional materials behaviors on a voxel basis is proposed; this allows for arranging materials in any distribution and rapidly evaluating the behavior of the distribution. Homogeneous and heterogeneous objects made of conventional materials and SMs were modeled and simulated. The modeled SMs were limited to non-programmable shape changing SMs including: piezoelectric material, electro-/magneto-/photostrictive materials and hydrogel. A printed smart valve and a theoretical actuator (both from other publications) were used as test cases. These simulations have a speed reasonable for the design iterations needed in conceptual design phase and they yield results in good agreement with physics."}{"3D printing of continuous flax fibre reinforced biocomposites for structural applications ": "Recently, interest has been increasing in natural fibres as composite reinforcing fillers for polymer-based filaments manufactured with the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process, despite their moderate mechanical properties compared to pure polymer.\n                  An innovative way was proposed in the present work to optimize the mechanical properties of biocomposites. It was based on novel continuous flax fibre/PLA (cFF/PLA) composite filaments made with a customized co-extrusion process and printed with a simple and affordable printing machine. The microstructure of the printed cFF/PLA biocomposite evidenced a homogeneous distribution of yarn within the cross section, while the twisted flax yarn led to fibre-rich areas at mesoscale. The cFF/PLA showed tensile modulus and strength values that exceeded the only available published result on continuous natural fibre printed composites by >4.5 times. Tensile properties were in the same range as those for continuous glass fibre/PolyAmide (PA) printed composites, paving the way for the use of biocomposites in structural applications. Their weakest point was their transverse properties that remained poorer than similar flax/PLA thermocompressed composites."}{"In-situ anchoring of Fe3O4/ZIF-67 dodecahedrons in highly compressible wood aerogel with excellent microwave absorption properties ": "Lightweight aerogels with superior cavities have attracted great interest in the field of electromagnetic wave absorbing materials. In this work, a hierarchical porous wood aerogel modified with Fe3O4/ZIF-67 (Fe3O4/ZIF-67@WA) with high compressibility and low-density was fabricated by in-situ anchoring of magnetic Fe3O4/ZIF-67 rhombohedral dodecahedron in naturally delignified wood aerogel. Combining the advantages of both aerogels and magnetic Fe3O4/ZIF-67 particles, Fe3O4/ZIF-67@WA reveals excellent compression-resilience and efficient microwave absorption performance. It possesses a maximum reflection loss (RL) of about \u221223.4\u202fdB at a low thickness of 1.5\u202fmm and a specific electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of up to ~156.3\u202fdB\u202fcm3\u202fg\u22121. Moreover, the composites exhibit a broad absorption bandwidth under an ultrahigh frequency of 13.5\u201318.0\u202fGHz. In view of those excellent absorbing effects, the prepared green magnetic Fe3O4/ZIF-67@WA is likely to be used as a lightweight shielding material against electromagnetic radiation, especially for smart building and miniaturized device applications."}{"Materials with enhanced adhesive properties based on acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) blends for fused filament fabrication (FFF) ": "In the current work, we prepared a novel material suitable for additive manufacturing by using acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer as matrix and a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as additive. Conditions for successful printing via fused filament fabrication (FFF) were optimized for the ABS:TPU blends. Compatibility of ABS and TPU in the blends was studied by Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, showing the appearance of new supramolecular interactions via hydrogen bonding. Compositional studies were carried out by confocal Raman microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), demonstrating the good compatibility between the two compounds. Mechanical and adhesive properties were studied by 3D-printing different normalized test specimens in different directions. It was shown that blends containing 10\u201320\u202fwt% TPU led to enhanced adhesion between layers without loss in yield strength, while 30\u202fwt% TPU led to a good adhesion between layers and to the printing platform when printing at room temperature."}{"The role of the austenite grain size in the martensitic transformation in low carbon steels ": "There is sufficient experimental evidence to propose that the formation kinetics of athermal martensite directly depends on the austenite grain structure from which the martensite forms. Yet, this dependence is frequently ignored. The present study investigates the role of the prior austenite grain size (PAGS) in the martensitic transformation in low-carbon steels. The transformation kinetics was experimentally studied for PAGS in the range from 6 to 185\u202f\u03bcm and theoretically analysed based on the nucleation rate and the thermodynamic balance between the chemical driving force and the resistance exerted by the austenite against the progress of the transformation. It is observed that grain refinement shifts the martensite start temperature (M\n                     \n                        S\n                     ) to lower values and accelerates the transformation rate at initial stages. At a later stage, when approximately 30% martensite has formed, the transformation rate decreases rapidly for small PAGS, whereas higher rates are maintained in coarse-grained microstructures. The change in martensite formation rate with the grain size depends on the nuclei density and on the austenite strength. This research enables an optimised selection of processing parameters for the design of ultra-high strength steels that require the formation of a controlled fraction of martensite."}{"3D printed cork/polyurethane composite foams ": "Even though the production of 3D printed foams has already been widely studied, the main focus of the reports has been on their mechanical properties or their cushion behavior. In the present work a preliminary approach is made concerning the potential application of 3D printed PU foams for thermal applications with enhanced mechanical properties. For that propose, cork was used to enhance the properties of the resulting 3D printed composite foams. From the results obtained, it was observed that the addition of cork decreased the density and thermal conductivity of the ensuing foams. The stiffness of the ensuing composites was also reduced. Yet, the use of cork did not affect the thermal stability of the composites. Finally, the layer-to-layer bonding was evaluated and the results suggest that the addition of cork may not jeopardize the performance of the 3D printed PU foams. Besides their thermal insulation properties, the elastomeric behavior of the 3D printed foams produced may find applications that combine thermal insulation with damping properties. Furthermore, advances in the 3D printing technology may increase the range of applications of these foams."}{"Towards a high strength aluminium alloy development methodology for selective laser melting ": "Selective Laser Melting (SLM) has received tremendous attentions due to its high degree of flexibility for the design and fabrication of geometrically complex parts. However, the majority of the currently applied metals for this advanced technology are still based on the traditional weldable and/or castable alloys, and the resulting mechanical properties of SLM fabricated samples are often mediocre. This is because the conventional alloys are not designed to accommodate the dynamic metallurgical characteristics of the SLM process and the benefits offered by SLM are not fully captured. In this study, an experimentally-based novel alloy development methodology utilising wedge mould casting and laser remelting is proposed, and the processability and properties of the developed alloys can be predicted for SLM. By mimicking the high solidification rate of the SLM process, unconventionally large amounts of solute were successfully placed into solution in the aluminium (Al) matrix. A high strength Al-Mn-Sc based alloy has been successfully developed and verified by SLM processing. The developed alloy possessed an average yield strength of about 430\u202fMPa and a ductility of 21% in the as fabricated state, compared to approximately 570\u202fMPa and 18% after direct ageing for 5\u202fh at 300\u202f\u00b0C, respectively."}{"Computational modelling of strut defects in SLM manufactured lattice structures ": "Addition of manufacturing defects to computational models of 3D-printed lattice structures enable improved simulation accuracy. A computational model of a cellular structure based on finite element method (FEM) analysis, often starts from defect-free computer-aided design (CAD) geometries to generate discretised meshes. Such idealised CAD geometries neglect imperfections, which occur during the additive manufacturing process of lattice structures, resulting in model oversimplification. This research aims to incorporate manufacturing defects in the strut elements of a lattice structure, thereby enhancing predictive capabilities of models. In this work, a method of generating CAD AM representative strut models is proposed. The models are generated from micro-computer tomography (\u03bcCT) analysis of SLM fabricated struts. The proposed additive manufacturing (AM) representative strut FE model's axial stiffness and critical buckling load is compared to idealised- and \u03bcCT- based FE models, with significant error reduction over idealised strut models. The AM representative strut models are then used to generate full lattice FE models and compared with manufactured and idealised FE models. The AM representative FE lattice models show greater correlations toward experiment and more realistic deformation behaviours. Overall, the methodology used in this study demonstrates a novel approach to representing struts in FE models of AM fabricated lattice structures."}{"How to be a very safe maternity unit: An ethnographic study ": "Maternity care continues to be associated with avoidable harm that can result in serious disability and profound anguish for women, their children, and their families, and in high costs for healthcare systems. As in other areas of healthcare, improvement efforts have typically focused either on implementing and evaluating specific interventions, or on identifying the contextual features that may be generative of safety (e.g. structures, processes, behaviour, practices, and values), but the dialogue between these two approaches has remained limited. In this article, we report a positive deviance case study of a high-performing UK maternity unit to examine how it achieved and sustained excellent safety outcomes. Based on 143\u202fh of ethnographic observations in the maternity unit, 12 semi-structured interviews, and two focus groups with staff, we identified six mechanisms that appeared to be important for safety: collective competence; insistence on technical proficiency; monitoring, coordination, and distributed cognition; clearly articulated and constantly reinforced standards of practice, behaviour, and ethics; monitoring multiple sources of intelligence about the unit's state of safety; and a highly intentional approach to safety and improvement. These mechanisms were nurtured and sustained through both a specific intervention (known as the PROMPT programme) and, importantly, the unit's contextual features: intervention and context shaped each other in both direct and indirect ways. The mechanisms were also influenced by the unit's structural conditions, such as staffing levels and physical environment. This study enhances understanding of what makes a maternity unit safe, paving the way for better design of improvement approaches. It also advances the debate on quality and safety improvement by offering a theoretically and empirically grounded analysis of the interplay between interventions and context of implementation."}{"Mental health of children held at a United States immigration detention center ": "Rationale; Children held in immigration detention may be at risk for mental health disorders due to the impacts of pre-migration factors, including exposure to violence, their displacement from their home countries, their journey between countries, and the conditions of their detention. Limited research has demonstrated high rates of clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety disorders among detained immigrant children.\n                  Objective; In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the mental health of children held at a US immigration detention center over two months in mid-2018.\n                  Method; We interviewed 425 mothers about their eldest child age 4\u201317 using the Parent-Report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A subset of 150 children age \u22659 completed the UCLA Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (PTSD-RI).\n                  Results; Among the 425 children studied, many demonstrated elevated scores for emotional problems (32%), peer problems (14%) and total difficulties (10%) on the SDQ. Younger children (age 4\u20138 years) demonstrated more difficulties associated with conduct, hyperactivity, and total difficulties (all p\u202f<\u202f0.001) compared to older children. Children who had been forcibly separated from their mothers demonstrated significantly more emotional problems (49%, p\u202f=\u202f0.003) and total difficulties (15%, p\u202f=\u202f0.015) than those who had never been separated. Of the 150 children who completed the PTSD-RI, 17% had a probable diagnosis of PTSD. In all, nearly half (44%) of all children demonstrated at least one emotional or behavioral concern.\n                  Conclusions; These data demonstrate that children being held in immigration detention experience high levels of mental health distress. Results suggest they would benefit from more comprehensive mental health screening and release into the community, as well as culturally-responsive and trauma-informed mental health care."}{"A shorter working week for everyone: How much paid work is needed for mental health and well-being? ": "There are predictions that in future rapid technological development could result in a significant shortage of paid work. A possible option currently debated by academics, policy makers, trade unions, employers and mass media, is a shorter working week for everyone. In this context, two important research questions that have not been asked so far are: what is the minimum amount of paid employment needed to deliver some or all of the well-being and mental health benefits that employment has been shown to bring? And what is the optimum number of working hours at which the mental health of workers is at its highest? To answer these questions, this study used the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009\u20132018) data from individuals aged between 16 and 64. The analytical sample was 156,734 person-wave observations from 84,993 unique persons of whom 71,113 had two or more measurement times. Fixed effects regressions were applied to examine how changes in work hours were linked to changes in mental well-being within each individual over time. This study found that even a small number of working hours (between one and 8\u202fh a week) generates significant mental health and well-being benefits for previously unemployed or economically inactive individuals. The findings suggest there is no single optimum number of working hours at which well-being and mental health are at their highest - for most groups of workers there was little variation in wellbeing between the lowest (1\u20138\u202fh) through to the highest (44\u201348\u202fh) category of working hours. These findings provide important and timely empirical evidence for future of work planning, shorter working week policies and have implications for theorising the future models of organising work in society."}{"Public acceptability of nudging and taxing to reduce consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and food: A population-based survey experiment ": "There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of choice architecture or \u2018nudge\u2019 interventions to change a range of behaviours including the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and food. Public acceptability is key to implementing these and other interventions. However, few studies have assessed public acceptability of these interventions, including the extent to which acceptability varies with the type of intervention, the target behaviour and with evidence of intervention effectiveness. These were assessed in an online study using a between-participants full factorial design with three factors: Policy (availability vs size vs labelling vs tax) x Behaviour (alcohol consumption vs tobacco use vs high-calorie snack food consumption) x Evidence communication (no message vs assertion of policy effectiveness vs assertion and quantification of policy effectiveness [e.g., a 10% change in behaviour]). Participants (N\u202f=\u202f7058) were randomly allocated to one of the 36 groups. The primary outcome was acceptability of the policy. Acceptability differed across policy, behaviour and evidence communication (all ps\u202f<\u202f.001). Labelling was the most acceptable policy (supported by 78%) and Availability the least (47%). Tobacco use was the most acceptable behaviour to be targeted by policies (73%) compared with policies targeting Alcohol (55%) and Food (54%). Relative to the control group (60%), asserting evidence of effectiveness increased acceptability (63%); adding a quantification to this assertion did not significantly increase this further (65%). Public acceptability for nudges and taxes to improve population health varies with the behaviour targeted and the type of intervention but is generally favourable. Communicating that these policies are effective can increase support by a small but significant amount, suggesting that highlighting effectiveness could contribute to mobilising public demand for policies. While uncertainty remains about the strength of public support needed, this may help overcome political inertia and enable action on behaviours that damage population and planetary health."}{"Scaling up: The politics of health and place ": "Research into the role of place in shaping inequalities in health has focused largely on examining individual and/or localised drivers, often using a context-composition framing. Whilst this body of work has advanced considerably our understanding of the effects of local environments on health, and re-established an awareness of the importance of place for health, it has done so at the expense of marginalising and minimising the influences of macro political and economic structures on both place and health. In this paper, we argue that: (i) we need to scale up our analysis, moving beyond merely analysing local horizontal drivers to take wider, vertical structural factors into account; and (ii) if we are serious about reducing place-based health inequalities, such analysis needs be overtly linked to appropriate policy levers. Drawing on three case studies (the US mortality disadvantage, Scotland's excess mortality, and regional health divides in England and Germany) we outline the theoretical and empirical value of taking a more political economy approach to understanding geographical inequalities in health. We conclude by outlining the implications for future research and for efforts to influence policy from \u2018scaling up\u2019 geographical research into health inequalities."}{"Tracing medicinal agencies: Antidepressants and life-effects ": "This article is inspired by the social life of methods approach, joining a movement among social scientists engaging with \u2018big data\u2019 to contribute to methodological innovation and conceptual development in research and knowledge translation. It explores human-drug associations using a computational tool, Medicine Radar, meanwhile raising questions about the ways a digital device pushes us to rethink how drugs are known in the everyday. Medicine Radar is an apparatus for exploring human-drug associations by means of Suomi24 (Finland24) data, containing 19 million health-related online posts spanning a period of 16 years. Using defined markers, Medicine Radar sorts the medicine talk in health-related discussions, thereby assisting us to \u2018see\u2019 the actions of the drug and human responses to them. This kind of approach distances the drug from the illness experience, drawing attention to the private details of the human-drug relationship. The empirical analysis separates three areas of antidepressant use: articulations of reactions, stabilizing the life effects of drugs and coming to terms with antidepressants. Together, the online posts urge us to think of everyday experience where the effects of drugs \u2013 intended or unintended \u2013 are always lived. The side effects of antidepressants, including drowsiness, ravenous hunger, loss of sexual desire and emotional numbness, become life effects. As will be demonstrated, the move from conceptualizing such fallout as side effects to understanding them as life effects has political ramifications. The computation tool adds collective weight to antidepressant experiences and calls for politicizing their effects on life."}{"The (in)visible health risks of climate change ": "This paper scrutinizes the assertion that knowledge gaps concerning health risks from climate change are unjust, and must be addressed, because they hinder evidence-led interventions to protect vulnerable populations. First, we construct a taxonomy of six inter-related forms of invisibility (social marginalization, forced invisibility by migrants, spatial marginalization, neglected diseases, mental health, uneven climatic monitoring and forecasting) which underlie systematic biases in current understanding of these risks in Latin America, and advocate an approach to climate-health research that draws on intersectionality theory to address these inter-relations. We propose that these invisibilities should be understood as outcomes of structural imbalances in power and resources rather than as haphazard blindspots in scientific and state knowledge. Our thesis, drawing on theories of governmentality, is that context-dependent tensions condition whether or not benefits of making vulnerable populations legible to the state outweigh costs. To be seen is to be politically counted and eligible for rights, yet evidence demonstrates the perils of visibility to disempowered people. For example, flood-relief efforts in remote Amazonia expose marginalized urban river-dwellers to the traumatic prospect of forced relocation and social and economic upheaval. Finally, drawing on research on citizenship in post-colonial settings, we conceptualize climate change as an \u2018open moment\u2019 of political rupture, and propose strategies of social accountability, empowerment and trans-disciplinary research which encourage the marginalized to reach out for greater power. These achievements could reduce drawbacks of state legibility and facilitate socially-just governmental action on climate change adaptation that promotes health for all."}{"ALD derived Fe3+- doping toward high performance P2\u2013Na0.75Ni0.2Co0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode material for sodium ion batteries ": "The structural instability and sluggish kinetic process of the pristine Na0.75Ni0.2Co0.2Mn0.6O2 (NCM) occurring at a high working voltage result in obvious capacity loss. In this study, Fe3+ doping onto the surface of the P2-type Na0.75Ni0.2Co0.2Mn0.6O2 (NCM) was fulfilled via post-annealing atomic layer deposition (ALD) derived Fe2O3 layer. It indicates that the modified NCM cathode materials exhibit better crystal structure stability and electrochemical behavior than the pristine NCM at wide voltage windows of 2.4\u20134.5\u00a0V and 2.4\u20134.7\u00a0V vs. Na/Na+. Furthermore, the ALD-30C-annealing material shows a higher initial capacity of 107\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121 at 0.1C (20\u00a0mA\u00a0g\u22121), and it can reach a reversible capacity of 78\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121 and Coulombic efficiency of 96.6% after 100 cycles at the cutoff voltage of 4.5\u00a0V. Amazingly, combined with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an anode material, the ALD-30C-annealing cathode material exhibits notable full cell performance with the specific energy density of 160\u00a0Wh kg\u22121 at the high voltage widows of 2.4\u20134.5\u00a0V after 100 cycles. The designed strategy in this work may be one of the most promising perspectives toward the high performance cathode materials for SIBs."}{"Hydrothermal synthesis of three-dimensional core-shell hollow N-doped carbon encapsulating SnO2@CoO nanospheres for high-performance lithium-ion batteries ": "A new three-step route to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) core-shell hollow N-doped carbon encapsulating SnO2@CoO nanospheres (namely, SCC) is developed. The NH4F plays a key role for conformal growth to generate Co3O4 layers. The polydopamine layer is regarded as carbon and nitrogen source for the formation of N-doped carbon shell which is used as a reductant to convert Co3O4 into CoO. Owing to its unique core-shell architectures to provide conductive networks and flexible buffering matrix, the anodic material exhibits prominent lithium storage performance according to high specific capacity (1081\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0at 100\u00a0mA\u00a0g\u22121 for 100 cycles), high rate capacity (803.1 mAh g\u22121\u00a0at 2\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121), and good capacity retention (881.7\u00a0mAh g\u22121 at 1\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121 for 550 cycles) with consistently high coulombic efficiency."}{"Trace anodic migration of iridium and titanium ions and subsequent cathodic selectivity degradation in acid electrolysis systems ": "The oxygen evolution reaction in acidic electrolyzers requires the presence of stable catalysts and current collectors at the anode. IrO2 catalysts and Ti current collectors are among the best in this regard. We show evidence of iridium and titanium corrosion and subsequent membrane crossover in long-term experiments of proton-exchange membrane electrolyzers for H2O2 production. The accumulation of trace iridium at the cathode was linked to degraded performance and increased cathodic current from hydrogen evolution. Detection of trace metal content at the cathode electrodes was enabled by prompt-gamma ray activation analysis and neutron activation analysis. These findings are not just relevant for H2O2 electrolyzers but to any system using iridium-based anode catalysts, including CO2 electroreduction."}{"Templating synthesis of nickel cobaltite nanoflakes and their nanocomposites for making high-performance symmetric supercapacitors ": "Nickel cobaltite is one of the most popular pseudocapacitance materials for creating high-performance energy-storage devices because of its low cost, high electric conductivity, excellent electrochemical properties, and environmental friendliness. In this study, nickel cobaltite with nanoneedle morphology was synthesized by adopting the hydrothermal method. Change in the nickel cobaltite from nanoneedle to nanoflake morphology was induced by a template of the surface of a self-assembly graphene oxide (GO)/multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) three-dimensional block matrix. Electrodes fabricated from the nanoflake nickel cobaltite, GO, and MWCNT composite exhibited high specific capacitance of 1525\u00a0F\u00a0g\u22121 at a current density of 1\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121 and 1081\u00a0F\u00a0g\u22121 at a high current density of 100\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121. When these composite electrodes were used as both the anode and cathode to assemble a symmetric supercapacitor with a 6\u00a0M KOH electrolyte, the supercapacitor exhibited a maximum energy density of 25.2\u00a0Wh kg\u22121 and maximum power density of 5151\u00a0W\u00a0kg\u22121. Moreover, it maintained an excellent cycling stability of 99.6% of the initial capacitance value after 7000 charge\u2013discharge cycles, demonstrating its remarkable potential for application in energy-storage and conversion devices."}{"Introduction of lactobionic acid ligand into mixed-charge nanoparticles to realize in situ triggered active targeting to hepatoma cells ": "To overcome the dilemma between passive tissue targeting and active cell targeting, nanomaterials are often required to exhibit the transition from \u201cstealth\u201d to \u201cactive targetable\u201d in response to the pathological microenvironment. Here, we introduced a ternary surface modification method that incorporating active targeting ligand lactobionic acid with pH-sensitive mixed-charge surface. The resulted mixed-charge nanoparticles (LA@MC-GNPs) showed resistance to nonspecific adsorption of proteins and uptake by HepG2 cells at normal tissue pH 7.4, while underwent pH-sensitive aggregation and recovered active targeting capability at tumor acidic pH 6.5. The ternary surface modification method provided a simplest strategy to solve the dilemma between passive and active targeting of nanomedicine."}{"Ceramics with the signature of wood: a mechanical insight ": "In an attempt to mimic the outstanding mechanical properties of wood and bone, a 3-D heterogeneous chemistry approach has been employed in a biomorphic transformation process (in which sintering is avoided) to fabricate ceramics from rattan wood, preserving its hierarchical fibrous microstructure. The resulting material (called biomorphic apatite, BA, in the following) possesses a highly bioactive composition and is characterized by a multi-scale hierarchical pore structure, based on nano-twinned hydroxyapatite lamellae, which is shown to display a lacunar fractal nature. The mechanical properties of BA are found to be exceptional (when compared to usual porous hydroxyapatite and other ceramics obtained from wood through sintering) and unique, as they occupy a zone in the Ashby map previously free from ceramics, but not far from wood and bone. Mechanical tests show that: (i.) the strength in tension may exceed that in compression, (ii.) failure in compression involves complex exfoliation patterns, thus resulting in high toughness, (iii.) differently from sintered porous hydroxyapatite, fracture does not occur \u2018instantaneously\u2019, but its growth may be observed and it exhibits tortuous patterns that follow the original fibrillar structure of wood, thus yielding outstanding toughness, (iv.) the anisotropy of the elastic stiffness and strength show unprecedented values when situations of stresses parallel and orthogonal to the main channels are compared. Despite being a ceramic material, BA displays a mechanical behaviour similar on the one hand to the ligneous material from which it was produced (therefore behaving as a \u2018ceramic with the signature of wood\u2019) and on the other to the cortical/spongy osseous complex constituting the structure of compact bone."}{"Janus particles: Design, Preparation, and Biomedical Applications ": "Janus particles with an anisotropic structure have emerged as a focus of intensive research due to their diverse composition and surface chemistry, which show excellent performance in various fields, especially in biomedical applications. In this review, we briefly introduce the structures, composition, and properties of Janus particles, followed by a summary of their biomedical applications. Then we review several design strategies including morphology, particle size, composition, and surface modification, that will affect the performance of Janus particles. Subsequently, we explore the synthetic methodologies of Janus particles, with an emphasis on the most prevalent synthetic method (surface nucleation and seeded growth). Following this, we highlight Janus particles in biomedical applications, especially in drug delivery, bio-imaging, and bio-sensing. Finally, we will consider the current challenges the materials face with perspectives in the future directions."}{"Removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions by adsorption using single and mixed pillared clays ": "This work concerns the application of single and mixed pillared clays in adsorption of inorganic pollutant in the water: the cadmium, the cobalt, and the copper. Adsorption experiments were conducted under various conditions, i.e., pH, contact time, initial concentration, and temperature. A comparison of the adsorption of the three metals onto pillared clays and natural clays suggested that pillared clays had higher adsorption affinity for metals than the unpillared clays. The experimental results indicated that the pillared clays rich on cerium show better properties on Cd2+, Co2+, and Cu2+ adsorption than those without cerium, which made them the promising recycling metals adsorbents. The equilibrium isotherm data were analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations. In all cases, the adsorption process fitted the second-order kinetics well, and the isotherm equation due to Langmuir showed good fits with the experimental data."}{"Interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals: New insights and broader applications ": "Interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals are ubiquitous in nature and are involved in the formation and transformation of clay minerals and the global cycles of many elements. The fungi/actinomyces in microbes are also associated with clay minerals, but bacteria are more widely linked. These interactions are also involved in the adsorption and fixation of heavy metals and the decomposition of organic pollutants in soil. Knowledge of these interactions can be utilised for the refinement and purification of clay minerals in industry. This review provides an overview of recent studies and obtains insights into the interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals. Microorganisms can induce the nucleation and growth of clay minerals. The metabolism of microorganisms can also degrade and transform clay minerals. The interaction between microorganisms and clay minerals promots the transformation of smectite to illite (S-I) and vice versa (I-S). Such interactions significantly contribute to the global cycles of various elements, such as Al, Si, Mg, Fe, P, S, C, and N. Microorganisms and clay minerals can form complexes and composite materials that adsorb heavy metals such as Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn, Co, Ni, Ag, and Hg. Microorganism adhesion to clay minerals is involved in the synergistic adsorption and decomposition of organic pollutants in soil and water. This literature review indicates that knowledge of the interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals has been significantly deepened over recent years. However, the interaction between microorganisms and clay minerals under natural geological conditions and the inherent mechanisms involved are not yet well understood. Future work on interactions between microorganisms and clay minerals has great implications for handling atmospheric micro/nano particle pollutants, understanding the formation, alteration and diagenesis of clay minerals and other related minerals, tracking primitive life on Earth and exploring extraterrestrial planets."}{"Keggin-Al30: An intercalant for Keggin-Al30 pillared montmorillonite ": "Clay minerals intercalated with inorganic species, known as pillared interlayered clays, have received extensive attention in recent decades. In this work, by comparison with those of Keggin-Al13, the formation processes of Keggin-Al30 are discussed based on different hydrolysis reactions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscope, and thermogravimetric analyses were applied to compare differences in crystal structure, morphology, and thermal stability between Keggin-Al13 and Keggin-Al30 (sulfates). High temperature and excess monomeric Al species are key factors controlling the transformation from \u03b5-Keggin-Al13 to \u03b4-Keggin-Al13 and finally to Keggin-Al30. A decrease of the crystal symmetry from Keggin-Al13 to Keggin-Al30 was confirmed by shifts of reflections (and decreases of intensities) on XRD patterns. Keggin-Al30 has a more compact structure, which leads to higher thermal stability. The distributions of functional groups and positive charges on the surface of Keggin-Al30 result in a \u201clying flat\u201d arrangement configuration in the interlayer region of montmorillonite. Exploring the behaviors of polycations as intercalants from their formation, transformation, and properties during the pillaring process may offer better understandings of the enhanced properties and wide applications of pillared interlayered clays."}{"Layered double hydroxide based bionanocomposites ": "Layered double hydroxides (LDH), also identified as anionic clays, have attracted much consideration due to their excellent ion exchange capacities, shape memory effect and ability to intercalate anions. LDH have been used in the different fields of applications such as biomedical, sensors and detectors, energy storage, novel and advanced functional materials etc. On other hand, biopolymers are environment friendly, fully degradable and sustainable materials, so they can be easily composed without harming nature. Degradation of biopolymers involves loss of structural, mechanical and chemical properties of the polymer and converting into biodegradable compounds which are helpful to the environment. Thus, bionanocomposites made from LDH and different biopolymers would have synergistic effect on their properties, which are necessary for actual applications. This review article deals with the preparation, properties and applications of bionanocomposites made from LDH and biopolymers such as heparin, deoxyribose nucleic acid, vitamin C and E, cellulose, chitosan, polylactic acid, different anionic biopolymers and starch."}{"Adsorption of a cationic methylene blue dye on an Algerian palygorskite ": "The capacity of an Algerian Tertiary sedimentary palygorskite to remove methylene blue was studied. The raw material was characterized using X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and chemical, granulometric and micotextural analyses. Kinetic experiments were carried out to study the effect of contact time, stirring speed, initial dye concentration and adsorbent mass on the adsorption processes. The palygorskite-rich material mainly consists of this fibrous clay (72%) and calcite (19%) with minor amounts of dolomite (5%), illite (2%) and quartz (2%). After 5\u202fmin contact time at room temperature, the adsorption reaction of a 50\u202fmL solution containing 10\u202fppm of methylene blue on 50\u202fmg of Cal-Pal as adsorbent reached equilibrium, and 97% of cationic dye was fixed. Temperature did not have a significant influence on methylene blue adsorption. The obtained adsorption isotherm indicates high affinity between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. The use of the studied Algerian palygorskite-rich sediment may have great potential for the elimination of textile dyes."}{"The role of geological origin of smectites and of their physico-chemical properties on aflatoxin adsorption ": "Since 2013, bentonite in the form of dioctahedral smectite is an additive authorised in the EU as a substance for the reduction of the contamination of feed by aflatoxins. Several studies indicate a big difference in the effectiveness of smectites in sequestering aflatoxins. A clear correlation between mineralogical and physico-chemical properties of smectites and aflatoxin adsorption has not been well established. In the effort to identify the most critical mineralogical, chemical, and physical properties that affect aflatoxin adsorption by smectites, 29 samples of bentonites obtained from different sources around the world were evaluated. \u201cAs received\u201d samples were divided into two main groups, i.e. hydrothermal (n=14) and sedimentary (n=15) bentonites depending on their geological origin. The characterization studies showed that all samples contained dioctahedral smectite as major mineral; a moderate CEC value (60-116 cmol/kg); the presence of iron; a small organic matter content; a near-neutral pH; and a fine and uniform particle size (<45\u03bcm). They differed substantially in their sodium, calcium and magnesium contents, and in the swelling properties depending on the geological origin. Several in vitro adsorption studies showed that they also differed in a significant manner in adsorbing aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). A correlation between geological origin and AFB1 adsorption capacity was found (p<0.001), being sedimentary smectites significantly more effective than hydrothermal ones in adsorbing the toxin at different pH values. The extent of AFB1 adsorption by all samples was negatively and linearly correlated to the extent of desorption, and sedimentary smectites were significantly more effective than hydrothermal smectites in keeping bound the adsorbed fraction of the toxin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). In addition, correlation studies using the Pearson statistical method showed a significant relationship among some physico-chemical properties of smectites and the amounts of adsorbed toxin. In particular, AFB1 adsorption by smectites correlated positively with sodium content and swell index, but negatively with d001-value, magnesium and calcium contents. In conclusion, it seems that the geological origin of smectite is a useful guide for the selection of bentonites for AFB1 detoxification. Sedimentary bentonites containing sodium/swelling-smectite should be preferred to hydrothermal samples as potential aflatoxin binders. Taking into account the geographical origin of our samples, this approach should be applicable to bentonites worldwide."}{"Competitive adsorption of antibiotic tetracycline and ciprofloxacin on montmorillonite ": "As antibiotics continue to be released into soils, it poses a potential threat to human and animal health. The migration-transformation of contaminants in soils is strongly affected by adsorption on clay. Tetracycline (TC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) which are extensively used have been attracted attention recently. Based on adsorption kinetics, isotherm, FT-IR, XRD and molecular simulation, the intercalation and environmental behavior of TC or CIP by montmorillonite (Mt) as single or mixed substance were studied and the adsorption mechanism was also proved. In the mixed system, the relationship between TC and CIP was a competition, but no preferential adsorption. The interaction between antibiotics in interlayer and the adsorption energies were simulated and calculated by molecular simulation to reveal the experimental results."}{"Adsorption of propranolol onto montmorillonite: Kinetic, isotherm and pH studies ": "The objective of this study was to explore the potential use of the smectite clay mineral montmorillonite (Mt) as adsorbent in the removal of water containing the emerging compound propranolol. The Mt was deeply characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Zeta potential and thermogravimetric analysis (DSC-TG), before and after adsorption experiments, and their isotherms and kinetic models were fitted to assess the adsorption of propranolol.\n                  The incorporation of propranolol in the interlayer was demonstrated by XRD and DSC-TG. The results obtained by Zeta potential indicated no adsorption of propranolol in the surface. Kinetic of propranolol adsorption onto Mt. was evaluated using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intra-particle diffusion and Elovich models. Pseudo-second order was the kinetic model that best described the adsorption of propranolol (R2\u202f>\u202f0.999). It was possible to obtain a removal efficiency of approximately 96% in <1\u202fmin. The adsorption equilibrium isotherm was fitted with the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevitch mathematical models to obtain the respective parameters. Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevitch were the models that best fitted the experimental data (R2\u202f>\u202f0.999). Due to the cationic form of propranolol, the adsorption by ionic exchange between charged propranolol and sodium cations onto the interlayer space was the most favorable pathway proposed. Results indicate that adsorption onto Mt proved to be an efficient method for removing propranolol, thus being a viable alternative for the treatment of water contaminated with this drug."}{"Hectorite: Synthesis, modification, assembly and applications ": "Hectorite (Na0.3Mg2.7Li0.3Si4O10(OH)2) is a trioctahedral clay mineral with peculiar cation exchange capacity, surface reactivity and adsorption, and easy delamination in water into individual nanolayers, which can then re-assemble in various ways. The aqueous dispersion of hectorite exhibits exclusive rheological and thixotropic properties. The paper reviews recent progress in the synthesis, modification, assembly and applications of hectorite. The present methods for synthesizing hectorite are hydrothermal synthesis, melt synthesis and structure-directed synthesis. Modification of hectorite can be made by ion exchange, intercalation, pillaring and grafting. Layer-by-layer assembly, template assembly and hierarchical assembly have been used to formed a variety of hectorite-containing hybrids and nanocomposites such as films, membranes, capsules and Janus nanoparticles. Hectorite and hectorite-derived materials can be used as adsorbents, catalysts, fluorescent reporters, hydrogels, and biomaterials. Literature survey has indicated that hectorite has been successfully used as rheological and thixotropic materials, and are being developed to be used in battery, fluorescent reporters, drug vehicles and tissue engineering."}{"Performance of magnetite/layered double hydroxide composite for dye removal via adsorption, Fenton and photo-Fenton processes ": "In order to investigate the effect of the addition of magnetite in layered double hydroxide (LDH) from a structural and catalytic point of view, the synthesis of LDH containing cobalt and chromium (CoCr-LDH) was performed with or without Fe3O4. These materials were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N2 adsorption Isotherms, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and evaluated as adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts in Fenton-like and photo-Fenton-like reactions. The results showed that the magnetite was prepared and incorporated to the LDH with success, forming a composite providing magnetic properties and promoting alteration in the morphology, quantity and size of the LDH pores. The evaluation of the adsorption and oxidation processes utilizing the Fe3O4/LDH composite showed to be more efficient than for pure LDH. This better performance can be explained by higher surface area and larger pores for Fe3O4/LDH which allow a more effective contact with the dye solution and more proximity of large molecules like those of Reactive Black with the sites where the OH\u2022 radicals are formed."}{"Phosphate capture by ultrathin MgAl layered double hydroxide nanoparticles ": "Capture of phosphorus from runoff and wastewater is of high priority in order to reclaim phosphorus for food security and to prevent water pollution. Here we report an environmentally friendly method to synthesize ultrathin MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles for phosphorus adsorption. Fast co-precipitation of magnesium and aluminum at 25\u201380\u202f\u00b0C in the presence of urea resulted in the desired LDH with variable admixtures of amorphous aluminum hydroxide (16\u201338%) quantified from solid state 27Al MAS NMR. Freshly synthesized particles appeared as exfoliated single layers that upon drying stacked to form particles with thickness of 3 to 5\u202fnm (four to six LDH layers) and lateral sizes of ~30\u202fnm, as seen by XRD, SEM, TEM, and AFM. Phosphate adsorption on LDH nanoparticles synthesized at room temperature (LDHns-U25) was very fast and reaction reached equilibrium within 15\u202fmin at pH\u202f8.5. The freeze-dried LDHns-U25 nanoparticles exhibited phosphate sorption capacity of 98\u202f\u00b1\u202f15\u202fmg P\u00b7g\u22121, which is 55% higher than for conventional LDH. Phosphate was bound to LDH electrostatically and via inner-sphere surface complexation as evidenced from a combination of 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy, surface potential measurements, IR spectroscopy, and ionic strength effects on phosphate sorption.

In this manuscript, new Fe3O4 nanoparticle/rectorite (Fe3O4/rectorite) catalysts are developed via in-situ precipitation oxidation reaction. Various physicochemical characterizations of Fe3O4/rectorite show that Fe3O4 nanoparticles (nano-Fe3O4) with an average particle diameter of approximately 10\u201320\u202fnm are effectively loaded on the surface of acid leached rectorite (Al-rectorite) and have low coaggregation and improved dispersion. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Fe3O4/rectorite on degradation of P-chlorophenol by heterogeneous Fenton method is studied. Results of degradation experiments show that Fe3O4/rectorite has higher degradation efficiency of P-chlorophenol than bare nano-Fe3O4. Regeneration studies also show that Fe3O4/rectorite maintains 100% of its maximum P-chlorophenol degradation capacity after seven consecutive cycles. Fe3O4/rectorite can be easily separated by magnetic separation, and thus has good stability and reusability. The degradation mechanism of Fe3O4/rectorite is adsorption coupled with a Fenton-like reaction, which accounts for P-chlorophenol degradation of up to 625\u202fmg/g. This work demonstrates a new composite material for the effective remediation of refractory organic compounds from wastewater."}{"Effects of properties of minerals adsorbents for the adsorption and desorption of volatile organic compounds (VOC) ": "In this study, adsorption and desorption performance of three mineral adsorbents (diatomite, clinoptilolite, and palygorskite) was investigated for abatement of six VOC with distinct physical and chemical properties and functional groups. Among the three mineral adsorbents, palygorskite exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for all the tested VOC as indicated by the adsorption breakthrough curves. Characterization of the adsorbents showed that palygorskite had the highest specific surface area and pore volume. The distinct adsorption capacities of minerals for VOC can be attributed to the difference of VOC's boiling point and polarity. Increasing the adsorption temperature and relative humidity decreased adsorption capacity of the minerals for VOC. Non-polar VOC showed more sensitivity to changes in temperature and relative humidity compared to polar VOC. Desorption performance of the mineral adsorbents was studied in 5-cycle adsorption/desorption experiments. The results indicated that the desorption purge gas has no significant impact on desorption efficiency. However, increasing desorption temperature clearly decreased the cumulative heel on the adsorbent. Moreover, non-polar VOC desorbed better from the mineral surface than polar VOC."}{"Towards Oxide Electronics: a Roadmap ": ""}{"Fabrication of 3D Co-doped Ni-based MOF hierarchical micro-flowers as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors ": "Ni-based metal organic frameworks have attracted great interests as novel electrode materials for applications in supercapacitors, in virtue of their large specific surface area, high porosity and diverse coordination structure. Unfortunately, their specific capacitance and rate property are usually unsatisfying because of the poor conductivity of MOF materials. Herein, 3D Co-doped Ni-based MOF (Cox-Ni-MOF, x\u202f=\u202f100n (Co/Ni)\u202f=\u202f0.5, 2 and 5) flower-like hierarchical microspheres are prepared via a facile hydrothermal process. The introduction of Co promotes the electrochemical behaviors of Ni-MOF, especially Co2-Ni-MOF. It exhibits a prominent specific capacitance of 1300\u202fF/g at 1\u202fA/g along with a superb rate performance (1021\u202fF/g at 10\u202fA/g). Meanwhile, capacitance for Co2-Ni-MOF retains 71% of the original capacitance even after 3000\u202fcycles. The improvement of electrochemical performance could be due to their unique structural and morphological characteristics including the 3D flower-like hierarchical microspheres structure, higher specific surface area and enhanced electrical conductivity. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor based on the Co2-Ni-MOF achieves an excellent energy density of 25.92\u202fWh/kg at a power density of 375\u202fW/kg."}{"MXene/Co3O4 composite material: Stable synthesis and its enhanced broadband microwave absorption ": "Microwave absorbers serve the purpose to ensure the transmission efficiency and accuracy in 5G telecommunications. Two-dimensional MXene has great potential in absorbing microwave. In this study, MXene(Ti3C2T\n                        x\n                     )/Co3O4 composites are successfully fabricated by a facile and stable hydrothermal treatment in concentrated strong base and Argon environment, followed by a one-step annealing process. Phase composition, chemical state of elements, morphology and structure of the new composite materials are studied by systematical characterization. It is revealed that adsorbed Na+ ions and terminations, which are generated at the interface during hydrothermal treatment in concentrated NaOH solution, can protect the Ti3C2T\n                        x\n                      from being decomposed. The synthesis mechanism is also proposed for stable fabrication of other MXene-based composite materials. The MXene/Co3O4 composite is able to perform single-band absorption, multiband absorption and even broadband absorption in 2\u201318\u202fGHz band by tuning its composition and thickness. Particularly, better than 90% absorption in a wide range of 10.8\u201317\u202fGHz can be achieved with a thickness of just 2\u202fmm. Enhanced wideband absorption originates from the multilayer structure, the surface defects, the conductivity of Ti3C2T\n                        x\n                      and the capacitance structure of Co3O4. Ultrathin and broadband high absorption features make the material a promising candidate for future application."}{"Advanced titanium dioxide-polytetrafluorethylene (TiO2-PTFE) nanocomposite coatings on stainless steel surfaces with antibacterial and anti-corrosion properties ": "Bacterial infection and corrosion are two of the most common causes of the failure for the use of biomedical metallic implants. In this paper, we developed a facile two-step approach for synthesizing a TiO2-PTFE nanocomposite coating on stainless steel substrate with both antibacterial and anticorrosion properties by using a sol-gel dip coating technique. A sub-layer of bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) was first coated on the stainless steel substrate to improve the adhesion and reactivity, then TiO2-PTFE was uniformly co-deposited onto the PDA sub-layer. Both PTFE and TiO2 contents had a significant influence on the surface energy of the TiO2-PTFE coating. The coating with the total surface energy of 26\u202fmJ/m2 exhibited minimal bacterial adhesion against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli WT F1693 and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus F1557, which was explained using the extended DLVO theory. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between TiO2 and PTFE, the TiO2-PTFE coating showed improved corrosion resistance in artificial body fluids compared with the sole TiO2 coating or PTFE coating. The TiO2-PTFE coating also demonstrated extraordinary biocompatibility with fibroblast cells in culture, making it a prospective strategy to overcome current challenges in the use of metallic implants."}{"Tea waste derived microporous active carbon with enhanced double-layer supercapacitor behaviors ": "Activated carbon (TC1200) is prepared from tea waste via activation and carbonization. The specific surface area of TC1200 is 911.92\u202fm2\u202fg\u22121 and N-doping is achieved simultaneously due to the existence of N-enriched components in the carbon precursor. The TC1200 exhibits superior capacitive performances on a symmetric supercapacitor in the aspects of ultralong cycle stability (96.66% capacitance retention after 16,000\u202fcycles at 4\u202fA\u202fg\u22121) and ultrahigh power density (33,494.70\u202fW\u202fkg\u22121 for an energy density of 19.45\u202fWh\u202fkg\u22121). The enhanced electroconductivity and the excellent wettability provided by the N elements synergistically facilitate the diffusion of the electrolyte ion into the bulk of the carbon material, greatly contributed to the double-layer capacitive behavior and the capacitance of the carbon material. This methodology supports the high-value added utilization of the biomass and provides an opportunity for the scalable production of activated carbons for supercapacitor energy storage devices."}{"V-MOF derived porous V2O5 nanoplates for high performance aqueous zinc ion battery ": "Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion battery is a promising energy storage device because of its low cost and high safety. However, they are still in their infancy due to the limited choice of cathodes with high capacity and satisfactory cycling performance. In this work, porous V2O5 materials were obtained by pyrolysis of vanadium-MOF and adopted as intercalation cathode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries. V2O5 purchased commercially as a control, the effects of specific surface area, pore size distribution and mixed valence of electrodes on the performance of batteries were studied. The novel cathode delivers high capacities of 300\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg\u2212\n                     1 compared to 60\u202fmAh\u202fg\u2212\n                     1 for C-V2O5 at current density of 100\u202fmA\u202fg\u2212\n                     1. The energy density of this Zn ion battery is about 230\u202fWh\u202fkg\u2212\n                     1, which is much higher than commercial lead acid batteries. The capacity of P-V2O5 electrode retains 120\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg\u2212\n                     1 even at 2000\u202fmA\u202fg\u2212\n                     1, which is much higher than that of C-V2O5. Moreover, the structure of V2O5 nanoplates and their composites with carbon materials can improve the cyclic stability."}{"Layered double hydroxide based active corrosion protective sealing of plasma electrolytic oxidation/sol-gel composite coating on AA2024 ": "This work reports a novel approach for growing layered double hydroxide (LDH) films on any plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) coated AA2024 independently of the nature of the PEO coating. The specific PEO coating chosen to carry out this work is considered to be not suitable for direct LDH growth because of phase composition and morphological features. In this paper, we describe a new methodology that consists of covering the PEO coating with a thin layer of aluminum oxide based xerogel as the source of aluminate ions for subsequent in-situ LDH growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed a successful formation of LDHs on the surface. An improvement in terms of active corrosion protection was also demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET)."}{"N2 reduction using single transition-metal atom supported on defective WS2 monolayer as promising catalysts: A DFT study ": "Nitrogen reduction reactions (NRRs) under mild conditions retain an enormous challenge in effective N2 activation on metal-based catalysts. Here, by spin-polarized DFT calculations, we systematically investigated the potential of single transition-metal atoms (Sc to Zn, Nb to Cd, W, Pt and Au) supported on the experimentally available WS2 nanosheets with sulfur vacancies as catalysts for N2 fixation and conversion. The results confirm that the WS2 nanosheet with sulfur vacancies is a good platform for anchoring single transition-metal atoms. Based on proposed several criteria, it is found that the single Ni atoms anchored to sulfur vacancies possess outstanding catalytic activity of NRR. Here, the Ni-WS2 nanosheet acts as likely Lewis-acid system and accepts electrons from the N2*, which causes the weakening of N\u2013N bond. Reaction energy diagrams of the NRRs show that the whole NRRs on Ni-WS2 surface prefer to occur along the alternating associative pathway, and form the ammonia without the requirement of energy input. Overall, our results reveal that the Ni-WS2 system is a quite promising single-atom catalyst with less energy-consuming and good stability for NRRs. These findings could motivate more experimental and theoretical researches to further explore the potential of single transition-metal atoms anchored to two-dimensional substrate materials for NRRs."}{"A method for calculating the strength of evidence associated with an earwitness's claimed recognition of a familiar speaker ": "The present paper proposes and demonstrates a method for assessing strength of evidence when an earwitness claims to recognize the voice of a speaker who is familiar to them. The method calculates a Bayes factor that answers the question: What is the probability that the earwitness would claim to recognize the offender as the suspect if the offender was the suspect versus what is the probability that the earwitness would claim to recognize the offender as the suspect if the offender was not the suspect but some other speaker from the relevant population? By \u201cclaim\u201d we mean a claim made by a cooperative earwitness not a claim made by an earwitness who is intentionally deceptive. Relevant data are derived from na\u00efve listeners' responses to recordings of familiar speakers presented in a speaker lineup. The method is demonstrated under recording conditions that broadly reflect those of a real case."}{"Scientific integrity in the forensic sciences: Consumerism, conflicts of interest, and transparency ": "The goal of this paper is to discuss scientific integrity, consumerism, conflicts of interest, and transparency within the context of forensic science. Forensic scientists play crucial roles within the legal system and are constantly under various pressures when performing analytical work, generating reports based on their analyses, or testifying to the content of these reports. Maintaining the scientific integrity of these actions is paramount to supporting a functional legal system and the practice of good science. Our goal is to discuss the importance of scientific integrity as well as the factors it may compromise, so that forensic practitioners may be better equipped to recognize and avoid conflicts of interest when they arise. In this discussion we define terms, concepts, and professional relationships as well as present three case studies to contextualize these ideas."}{"A risk-based approach to cognitive bias in forensic science ": "Over the past decade, the potential impact of cognitive bias in forensic science has instigated much discussion and debate between academics, scientists and those in the justice sector. Evidence of bias influencing subjective decision-making across a range of forensic disciplines has been described in the literature. Forensic service organisations are being urged to address cognitive bias in subjective decision-making by designing processes or procedures to limit access to (irrelevant) contextual information or reduce dependence on cognitive functions. Although some laboratories have implemented bias mitigating strategies, with varying impact on operational efficiency, there has been no systematic assessment of the risk posed by cognitive bias. Forensic Science SA assessed the potential impact of bias on forensic interpretations across multiple disciplines, using a risk management framework. This process proved useful in assessing the effectiveness of existing bias mitigating strategies and identified the latent level of risk posed. While all forensic organisations should seek to implement bias limiting measures that are simple, cost-effective and do not adversely impact efficiency, using a risk-based approach has contextualised the limited benefit of introducing resource hungry measures, as postulated in the literature. That is not to suggest that forensic organisations should dismiss the potential influence of cognitive bias but they need to strike an appropriate balance between risk and return, as they do with any business risk."}{"Combining evidence in complex cases - a practical approach to interdisciplinary casework ": "Activity level evaluations, although still a major challenge for many disciplines, bring a wealth of possibilities for a more formal approach to the evaluation of interdisciplinary forensic evidence. This paper proposes a practical methodology for combining evidence from different disciplines within the likelihood ratio framework. Evidence schemes introduced in this paper make the process of combining evidence more insightful and intuitive thereby assisting experts in their interdisciplinairy evaluation and in explaining this process to the courts.\n                  When confronted with two opposing scenarios and multiple types of evidence, the likelihood ratio approach allows experts to combine this evidence in a probabilistic manner. Parts of the prosecution and defence scenarios for which forensic science is expected to be informative are identified. For these so called core elements, activity level propositions are formulated. Afterwards evidence schemes are introduced to assist the expert in combining the evidence in a logical manner. Two types of evidence relations are identified: serial and parallel evidence. Practical guidelines are given on how to deal with both types of evidence relations when combining the evidence."}{"A comparative evaluation of the disulfur dinitride process for the visualisation of fingermarks on metal surfaces ": "The disulfur dinitride process for fingermark visualisation was first reported a decade ago, with promising results obtained for a range of materials including metals. However, the friction sensitive nature of the material and difficulty of synthesis made routine use difficult. Many of these issues have since been addressed, making equipment and chemicals available to build an understanding of how the effectiveness of disulfur dinitride compares to other fingermark visualisation processes currently used on metal surfaces. This enables more informed advice to be given on selection of processes for treatment of metal items, an area of operational interest that encompasses weapons used in violent crime and the increasing incidence in metal theft. This paper reports a comparative study into the effectiveness of disulfur dinitride, cyanoacrylate fuming, vacuum metal deposition, gun blueing and wet powder suspensions on brass, bronze, copper and stainless steel. Experiments were conducted with the surfaces exposed to a range of environments including long term ageing, water/detergent washing, acetone washing and high temperature exposure. The results indicate that disulfur dinitride is an effective process for fingermark visualisation on metal surfaces, including those exposed to adverse environments, and may offer potential improvements over existing processes for those surfaces. Further work, including pseudo-operational trials, is recommended."}{"What do forensic analysts consider relevant to their decision making? ": "In response to research demonstrating that irrelevant contextual information can bias forensic science analyses, authorities have increasingly urged laboratories to limit analysts' access to irrelevant and potentially biasing information (Dror and Cole (2010) [3]; National Academy of Sciences (2009) [18]; President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (2016) [22]; UK Forensic Science Regulator (2015) [26]). However, a great challenge in implementing this reform is determining which information is task-relevant and which is task-irrelevant. In the current study, we surveyed 183 forensic analysts to examine what they consider relevant versus irrelevant in their forensic analyses. Results revealed that analysts generally do not regard information regarding the suspect or victim as essential to their analytic tasks. However, there was significant variability among analysts within and between disciplines. Findings suggest that forensic science disciplines need to agree on what they regard as task-relevant before context management procedures can be properly implemented. The lack of consensus about what is relevant information not only leaves room for biasing information, but also reveals foundational gaps in what analysts consider crucial in forensic decision making."}{"When finding nothing may be evidence of something: Anti-forensics and digital tool marks ": "There are an abundance of measures available to the standard digital device users which provide the opportunity to act in an anti-forensic manner and conceal any potential digital evidence denoting a criminal act. Whilst there is a lack of empirical evidence which evaluates the scale of this threat to digital forensic investigations leaving the true extent of engagement with such tools unknown, arguably the field should take proactive steps to examine and record the capabilities of these measures. Whilst forensic science has long accepted the concept of toolmark analysis as part of criminal investigations, \u2018digital tool marks\u2019 (DTMs) are a notion rarely acknowledged and considered in digital investigations. DTMs are the traces left behind by a tool or process on a suspect system which can help to determine what malicious behaviour has occurred on a device. This article discusses and champions the need for DTM research in digital forensics highlighting the benefits of doing so."}{"The use of contextual information in forensic toxicology: An international survey of toxicologists' experiences ": "Cognitive bias is a well-documented automatic process that can have serious negative consequences in a variety of settings. For example, cognitive bias within a forensic science setting can lead to examiners' judgements being swayed by details that they have learned while working on the case, and which go beyond the physical evidence being examined. Although cognitive bias has been studied in many forensic disciplines, such as fingerprints, bullet comparison, and document examination, knowledge of cognitive bias within forensic toxicology is lacking. Here, we address this knowledge gap by assessing the reported use of contextual information by an international group of forensic toxicologists attending the 54th conference of The International Association of Forensic Toxicologists (TIAFT) in Brisbane in 2016. In a first study, participants read a set of simple post-mortem toxicology results (two drug concentrations in blood) and then indicated what information they would normally use when interpreting these results in their day-to-day casework. Using a questionnaire, we then surveyed the familiarity of toxicologists with contextual bias and captured any suggested bias-minimizing procedures for use in forensic toxicology laboratories. Thirty-six participants from 23 different countries and with a range of 1\u201335\u202fyears' forensic toxicology reporting experience volunteered. Analysis of their responses showed that the majority of participants reported using some contextual information in their interpretation of these post-mortem toxicology results (range\u202f=\u202f3\u201315 pieces of information, median\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD\u202f=\u202f11\u202f\u00b1\u202f3), the most common being the deceased's history of prescription or illicit drug use. More than three-quarters of participants reported being familiar with the concept of contextual bias, although few (n\u202f=\u202f9) worked in laboratories that had a formal policy covering it. Over half of participants knew of at least one bias-minimizing procedure specifically for forensic toxicology casework, but only a quarter (overall) reported using bias-minimizing procedures in their laboratories. Our results provide substantial evidence that although practising forensic toxicologists are familiar with contextual bias, many report that they still engage in behaviours that could lead to cognitive bias (e.g., through the use of contextual information, through lack of explicit policies or bias-minimizing procedures). We anticipate that our work will form the basis of further research involving a larger sample of participants and examining other potentially relevant factors such as sex/gender, country and accreditation of laboratories."}{"Confined on-surface organic synthesis: Strategies and mechanisms ": "On-surface synthesis has been one of the hottest research fields in surface science in the last decade, owing to its great potential for bottom-up synthesis of functional molecules and covalent nanomaterials. Compared to classical in-solution chemistry, all of the on-surface reactions are done without solvent, thus very minimal byproducts and no limitation of solubility are involved. However, because of its typically required ultra-high vacuum conditions, where only limited catalysts can be used, a key challenge for on-surface synthesis is the precise control of the reaction pathway. Countless efforts have been made for controllable synthesis of target chemical structures on surfaces by distinct strategies. These strategies can be summarized under following aspects: 1) rational choice of surfaces; 2) template effects based on two-dimensional (2D) environments; 3) on-surface thermodynamic and kinetic controls; 4) the participation of chemisorbed nonmetal adatoms on surfaces. This report reviews the recent progress toward the control of on-surface synthesis and raises a series of questions at the end, which deserve further explorations in the future."}{"Physical and chemical phenomena occurring between solid ceramics and liquid metals and alloys at laser and plasma composite coatings formation: A review ": "The review describes the physical and chemical phenomena occurring between solid ceramics used as reinforcement and liquid metals and alloys used as matrix in the composite coatings. Initially, the properties of typical matrix metals as Ni, Co, Fe and alloys as Ni-based (NiCr, NiAl, NiCrAlY,\u2026) and Co-based (Stellites) alloys in liquid state are described. Then, the phenomena related to the diffusion of some atoms such as nitrogen or carbon in liquid metals and alloys solidification are described. Subsequently, the phenomena at the interface between liquid metals and alloys and solid ceramics such as oxides or carbides during the coatings' formation are reviewed. Finally, the methods of composite coatings deposition using laser cladding and plasma transferred arc are described and the properties of the composite coatings related to their microstructure are discussed by taking into account the phenomena in melt-pool."}{"Surface chemistry and catalysis of oxide model catalysts from single crystals to nanocrystals ": "Fundamental understandings of surface chemistry and catalysis of solid catalysts are of great importance for the developments of efficient catalysts and corresponding catalytic processes, but have been remaining as a challenge due to the complex nature of heterogeneous catalysis. Model catalysts approach based on catalytic materials with uniform and well-defined surface structures is an effective strategy. Single crystals-based model catalysts have been successfully used for surface chemistry studies of solid catalysts, but encounter the so-called \u201cmaterials gap\u201d and \u201cpressure gap\u201d when applied for catalysis studies of solid catalysts. Recently catalytic nanocrystals with uniform and well-defined surface structures have emerged as a novel type of model catalysts whose surface chemistry and catalysis can be studied under the same operational reaction condition as working powder catalysts, and they are recognized as a novel type of model catalysts that can bridge the \u201cmaterials gap\u201d and \u201cpressure gap\u201d between single crystals-based model catalysts and powder catalysts. Herein we review recent progress of surface chemistry and catalysis of important oxide catalysts including CeO2, TiO2 and Cu2O acquired by model catalysts from single crystals to nanocrystals with an aim at summarizing the commonalities and discussing the differences among model catalysts with complexities at different levels. Firstly, the complex nature of surface chemistry and catalysis of solid catalysts is briefly introduced. In the following sections, the model catalysts approach is described and surface chemistry and catalysis of CeO2, TiO2 and Cu2O single crystal and nanocrystal model catalysts are reviewed. Finally, concluding remarks and future prospects are given on a comprehensive approach of model catalysts from single crystals to nanocrystals for the investigations of surface chemistry and catalysis of powder catalysts approaching the working conditions as closely as possible."}{"Gas-surface interactions on two-dimensional crystals ": "Two-dimensional (2D) crystals have developed into a popular mainstream research topic which is interesting for basic research and many applications. Gas-surface interactions, as reviewed here, are important for catalysis including noble metal-free catalysts, materials science, and surface science as well as environmental and energy technologies. Basic science concerns fundamental differences of 2D crystals and bulk materials as well as e.g. how the substrate of epitaxial 2D crystals affects their surface properties.\n                  Most of the attention so far obtained (gas-phase) water adsorption which always was an evergreen in surface science. However, studies about small inorganic/organic molecule adsorption (CO, CO2, NOx, O2, H, rare gases, H2S, SO2, alkanes, benzene, alcohols, thiophene, etc.) and surface reactions on 2D crystals (CO oxidation, ethylene epoxidation, oxygen reduction reaction, SO2 and H2SO3 oxidation) started to appear in the literature as well. This review describes all of these probe molecules, but focuses on experimental and theoretical surface science model studies usually conducted at ultra-high vacuum (UHV).\n                  The review focusses on graphene and functionalized graphene (graphene oxide, N-graphene, etc.) since the bulk of the literature deals with that system. However, included in fair detail are also many other 2D crystals such as silicatene, zeolite films (doped silicatene), metal dichalcogenides (such as MoS2, WS2), boron nitride, MXenes, germanene, silicene, TiO2, graphane, graphone, and portlandene.\n                  As a prototypical example, in recent projects, the wetting properties of e.g. graphene for water were controversially discussed. Therefore, a long chapter is devoted to water on graphene. That dispute was originally based on contact angle measurements at ambient pressure. In the meanwhile detailed surface science works including theoretical modelling are available. Literature on other carboneous surfaces such as HOPG (see list of acronyms) will be considered as a reference. Related works are also visible for other inorganic 2D crystals such as silicatene, i.e., 2D-SiO2, or 2D-MoS2 as well as functionalized 2D crystals (i.e. graphene oxide, N-doped graphene, graphane, etc.). Hydrophobic systems also are interesting for applications.\n                  Although included in this review, but not described in very detail are electro chemistry studies, projects in the liquid phase, photo-chemistry, high pressure catalysis, and pure engineering studies (membranes, separation, fuel cells). However, in comparison with 2D crystals and to perhaps motivate related UHV surface chemistry projects in the future many of these projects were included to some extent.\n                  As a broader objective, this review summarizes the currently available knowledge needed to extend the use of 2D materials beyond the utilization of their remarkable electronic and mechanical properties."}{"Removal of some harmful metal ions from wet-process phosphoric acid using murexide-reinforced activated bentonite ": "Highly efficient elimination of UO2\n                     2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+ from wet-process phosphoric acid (WPPA) was investigated as a batch system using murexide-reinforced activated bentonite (MRAB), which was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), and fourier tranform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. The experimental adsorption capacities of UO2\n                     2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+ were 155.0, 180.0, 190.0, 143.0, 115.0, and 170.0\u00a0mg/g at 5\u00a0M\u00a0H3PO4, respectively. The obtained data indicated that the sorption technique used its functionality to remove six metal ions after six reuse/cycles, wherein the MRAB could be regenerated using HCl. The elimination of real impurities from WPPA was assessed through the proposed procedure under optimum conditions using MRAB."}{"3D graphene-containing structures for tissue engineering ": "Graphene and its derivatives have been extensively explored in various fields and have shown great promise toward energy harvesting, environmental protection, and health care. 3D graphene-containing structures (3DGCSs) are especially endowed with useable features relating to physicochemical properties within the hierarchical architectures. Thus, 3DGCSs are increasingly being applied for tissue engineering because of their supportability of human cells and functionalization potential. This review focuses on recent progress in tissue engineering utilizing 3DGCSs, providing insights into fabrication, application, and constraints in bionic research."}{"Boron-based polymers: opportunities and challenges ": "Boron-containing polymers have shown unique physicochemical properties which can be of great potential benefit in many fields. Although there have been several studies addressing different aspects of this class of polymers, there is still room for characteristic improvement for emerging applications. Therefore, finding the most efficient synthetic strategies for boron-containing polymers play a vital role in their performance. In this respect, various methods such as Sonogashira\u2212Hagihara coupling, hydroboration polymerization, alkene insertion, grafting, and polycondensation have been successfully employed. Boron-containing polymers are a fundamentally new class of materials with potential applications in many fields such as gas storage, waveguides, optical data storage, multiphoton microscopy, molecular machines, and even cell biology. This review article aims to critically discuss the challenges of various synthetic strategies of boron-containing polymers alongside their opportunities and potential uses in electronic, industrial, and medical applications."}{"Poly(amidoamine) dendrimers: covalent and supramolecular synthesis ": "Dendrimers, a class of synthetic macromolecules which are notable for their well-defined ramified structures and unique multivalent cooperativity, hold great promise for developing various functional materials. Among all the reported dendrimers, poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are the most extensively studied by virtue of their readily availability via robust synthesis as well as their dendritic structure and peptide/protein mimic features. Since the seminal report by Tomalia et al., various strategies have been made available for PAMAM dendrimers, including divergent and/or convergent synthesis alongside click chemistry. Nevertheless, preparation of high-generation and defect-free PAMAM dendrimers on a large scale remains challenging. To overcome the limitations, an alternative strategy based on self-assembling approach has emerged for dendrimer synthesis, where small dendritic components form large non-covalent supramolecular structures that mimic high-generation covalent dendrimers. This approach is easy to implement in practice and requires much less synthetic effort. Here, we present a brief overview of the different approaches established for PAMAM dendrimer synthesis. We start with a general introduction to dendrimers and the common strategies for dendrimer synthesis, and then we illustrate the specific approaches for PAMAM dendrimer synthesis and highlight the related advantages and limitations using representative examples. Although various strategies have been established for PAMAM dendrimer synthesis, innovative concepts and approaches are still in high demand for reliably preparing defect-free and high-generation dendrimers in large quantity."}{"Transient response of a gyro-elastic structured medium: Unidirectional waveforms and cloaking ": "The transient analysis of gyro-elastic structured media, composed of periodically placed masses interconnected by elastic rods and attached to gyroscopic spinners, is presented. The analysis is based on an asymptotic transient model, developed in this paper, that describes the interaction between a gyroscopic spinner and a mass embedded in a truss system. Several examples are given that illustrate the transient features of special dynamic phenomena, including unidirectional interfacial waves and highly localised waveforms. Two important applications of the model are also proposed, which demonstrate that gyro-elastic systems can be utilised to design an efficient structured topological insulator and a cloaking device for a discrete medium."}{"On the consistency of the nonlocal strain gradient elasticity ": "The nonlocal strain gradient elasticity theory is being widely used to address structural problems at the micro- and nano-scale, in which size effects cannot be disregarded. The application of this approach to bounded solids shows the necessity to fulfil boundary conditions, derived from an energy variational principle, to achieve equilibrium, as well as constitutive boundary conditions inherent to the formulation of the constitutive equation through convolution integrals. In this paper we uncover that, in general, is not possible to accomplish simultaneously the boundary conditions, which are all mandatory in the framework of the nonlocal strain gradient elasticity, and therefore, the problems formulated through this theory have no solution. The model is specifically applied to the case of static axial and bending behaviour of Bernoulli-Euler beams. The corresponding governing equation in terms of displacements results in a fourth-order ODE with six boundary conditions for the axial case, and in a sixth-order ODE with eight boundary conditions for the bending case. Therefore, the problems become overconstrained. Three study cases will be presented to reveal that all the boundary conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Although the ill-posedness has been pointed out for an elastostatic 1D problem, this characteristic holds for other structural problems. The conclusion is that the nonlocal strain gradient theory is not consistent when applied to finite structures and leads to problems with no solution in a general case."}{"Topology optimization for concurrent design of layer-wise graded lattice materials and structures ": "Mechanical properties of hierarchical lattice structures depend not only on their overall shapes and topologies, but also on their microstructural configurations. This paper proposes a new method for concurrent topology optimization of structures composed of layer-wise graded lattice microstructures. Both macroscale design variables representing the distribution of different lattice materials and microscale design variables defining the topologies of the microstructural unit cells are to be simultaneously optimized. This formulation thus integrates the microstructure design into the structural design, instead of pursuing a grey macroscale design and then interpreting the intermediate densities into certain microstructures. The proposed method also enlarges the design space by allowing for graded microstructures. Two new design constraints, namely the structural coverage constraint and the average porosity constraint, are introduced into the proposed optimization formulation to reduce the complexity of the constraints in the layer-wise graded design. The macroscale and microscale designs are linked by using the Asymptotic homogenization method to compute the effective elastic properties of the microstructured materials. Numerical examples show validity of the proposed method. It is also found that layer-wise graded lattice structures outperform those with uniform lattice microstructures in terms of structural stiffness. Finite element simulations of constructed models of the optimized designs suggest that graded lattice structures exhibit higher buckling resistance and ultimate load bearing capacity than single-scale solid material structures or uniform lattice structures under the same material usage."}{"Multiscale computational modelling of closed cell metallic foams with detailed microstructural morphological control ": "This contribution addresses the multiscale computational modelling of closed cell metallic foams by means of an integrated Representative Volume Element (RVE) generation and computation strategy. The microstructural geometry is computationally generated by controlling relevant fine scale features such as the distribution of cell sizes, the spatial organization of cell sizes and that of cell wall thicknesses and curvatures. The number of faces per cell and of edges per face are also set to comply with the experimentally observed values. The computational generation of the RVE is built on three ingredients: (i) a random close inclusions packing algorithm based on random sequential addition assisted by neighbour distance control, (ii) a distance field-based shape tessellation (morphing) that allows reproducing cell wall curvatures and varying cell wall thicknesses from the inclusions packing, (iii) a close control of the shape of the cells. The RVE geometry is thus described using implicit functions, thereby allowing a seamless transition towards a recently developed mesh generation technique for heterogeneous microstructures represented by such implicit functions, enabling simulations in standard softwares. This controlled generation methodology is illustrated based on experimental data available in literature for morphological indicators relevant to the foam mechanical behaviour. A qualitative and quantitative agreement between FE results and experimental data is obtained for the mechanical response of a commercially available ALPORAS foam. The individual contribution of each microstructural feature (size distributions, wall thickness and curvatures) to the average behaviour of closed cell foams is assessed through FE computations on increasingly complex geometries."}{"Variational nonlocal gradient elasticity for nano-beams ": "In the paper (Zaera, Serrano, & Fern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1ez, 2019) it is claimed that the nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT) leads to ill-posed structural problems. This conclusion was motivated by observing that Constitutive Boundary Conditions (CBC) conflict with non-standard Kinematic and Static Higher-Order Boundary Conditions (KHOBC) - (SHOBC). In the present study, it is shown that no ill-posedness holds if NSGT is established by an adequate variational formulation, with appropriate test fields. KHOBC and SHOBC have nothing to do with the proper mathematical formulation and thus they have not to be prescribed, while standard kinematic and static boundary conditions and CBC have to be imposed to close the relevant nonlocal gradient problem. This conclusion follows from a well-posed abstract variational scheme conceived for nonlocal gradient inflected beams. The treatment provides as special cases most of the size-dependent models adopted in Engineering Science to assess size-effects in nanostructures, such as NSGT, strain-driven and stress-driven local-nonlocal elasticity approaches. Additionally, a well-posed Nonlocal Stress Gradient (NStressG) model is presented, coupling the stress-driven nonlocal strategy (Romano and Barretta, 2017) with the stress gradient elasticity. The presented methodology is elucidated and validated by investigating the structural behavior of a variety of inflected nano-beams of nanotechnological interest, such as sensors and actuators. NStressG is able to predict both softening and hardening nonlocal responses and, unlike the special stress gradient elasticity model, leads to well-posed structural problems in Nanomechanics."}{"Improving compressive strength of high modulus carbon-fiber reinforced polymeric composites through fiber hybridization ": "There has been a strong demand in using high-modulus (HM) carbon-fiber composites potentially enabling lightweight aircraft structures with significant weight savings. However, extremely low fiber-direction compressive strength has been a well-recognized weakness of the HM composites, prohibiting their implementation in aircraft platforms. Hybridizing fibers with varying moduli provides an innovative means for improving the fiber-direction compressive strength of composites. This has been implemented by comingling intermediate-modulus (IM) and high-modulus (HM) carbon fibers in HM carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) toughened with nano-silica. Comingling IM and HM fibers at the filament level in addition to the matrix nano-sized structural reinforcement throughout the composite, increases shear modulus to axial modulus ratio of the composite material, thus improving microstructural stability likely governing the fiber-direction compressive strength behavior. The basis for this new material design stems from the fact that fiber-direction compressive strength increases with the shear modulus to axial modulus ratio of composites across different fiber and resin combinations. The results demonstrate that the new hybrid HM composite fiber-direction compressive strength achieves that of IM legacy composites but with more than 30% higher axial modulus."}{"On modeling of carbon nanotubes reinforced materials and on influence of carbon nanotubes spatial distribution on mechanical behavior of structural elements ": "A recently developed approximate approach for modeling of carbon nanotubes and for evaluation of the effective properties of carbon nanotubes reinforced materials is applied to analysis of square plate with hole under uniaxial tension. It is assumed, that the plate is made of polymer with randomly distributed and randomly oriented carbon nanotubes. Distributions of carbon nanotubes volume fraction is varied over the surface of the plate, with the constraint that the total volume of nanotubes in the structure is the same, and the effects of that on stress concentration is evaluated. Such special variation volume fraction makes the carbon nanotubes reinforced polymer a functionally graded material.\n                  In evaluation of the local effective properties the Gutrin\u2013Murdoch material surface model is applied to a hollow cylinder of finite thickness and combined with the notion of energy equivalence to replace carbon nanotube with an equivalent solid cylinder. The interphase, if any, can be modeled as a spring layer and subsequently added to obtain another equivalent solid cylinder. The material reinforced with such solid cylinders is then evaluated using the method of conditional moments, a stochastic homogenization approach proposed earlier for determination of the effective properties of random materials."}{"On the dynamics of small-sized structures ": "In this study, free vibration analyses of small-scaled trusses and frames are firstly carried out based on nonlocal elasticity of Eringen. Nonlocal matrix motion formulation is derived by using linear algebraic equations. Finite element method based weighted residual is utilized to solve the resulting equations. Various numerical studies are presented for nondimensional natural frequencies of different truss and frame models. A detailed parametric study is performed to investigate the influences of nonlocal parameter, geometric properties, direction angle, mode numbers, and length-to-diameter ratio on the natural frequencies of micro/nano trusses and frames. It is revealed that there is a significant relationship between the size-dependent dynamic response of these structures and the geometrical and structural properties of them."}{"On the dynamics of porous doubly-curved nanoshells ": "This work deals with free vibration analysis of doubly-curved nanoshells in which the material properties are temperature and porosity dependent, and varying along the thickness direction. The size-dependent effects of nanostructure systems are captured using the nonlocal strain gradient theory. A modified power law rule and the Hamiltonian principle are adopted, respectively, to obtain the material properties and governing equations of motion. An analytical technique based on Navier series is utilized to solve the eigenvalue problem and satisfied the boundary condition for simply-supported edges. The numerical results show that the vibration characteristics of the nanoshells are influenced by small scale parameters, geometry conditions, material compositions, porosities and thermal environment. Presented numerical results can serve as benchmarks for future analyses of doubly-curved nanoshells with porosity phases."}{"Understanding the effects of stress on the coefficient of thermal expansion ": "Important coupled effects of stress and temperature change have long been recognised and taken into account in models assessing the performance of solid materials. However, due to incomplete understanding, existing models used for concrete are essentially empirical and lack rational basis. This limits their predictive capability and applicability range. In this paper, fundamental thermodynamics and continuum mechanics laws are used to obtain an expression that quantitatively predicts the effects of stress on the coefficient of thermal expansion. The newly-defined thermal expansion coefficient is then used to develop a rational model, which is shown to be capable of reliably quantifying the coupling effects of stress and temperature change. Good agreement between the model predictions, available data and observations is obtained. Equally important, all parameters of the developed model can be determined using simple tests. This enables a wide adoption of the model in practical engineering applications. While this paper uses data for concrete, the proposed model is developed from first principles and using fundamental physical laws. The model should thus be applicable to a wide range of solid materials."}{"Cross-sectional nano-indentation of ion-irradiated steels: Finite element simulations based on the strain-gradient crystal plasticity theory ": "In this work, the cross-sectional nano-indentation of ion-irradiated steels is simulated by the crystal plasticity finite element method. Two dominant features, including the non-uniform irradiation hardening and indentation size effect, are characterized by considering the influence of inhomogeneously distributed irradiation defects and geometrically necessary dislocations within the framework of strain-gradient crystal plasticity theory. The theoretical model is applied for ion-irradiated 304 stainless steel. Both the fitted and predicted macroscopic mechanical responses are compared with experimental data under different irradiation conditions, which include the force-depth (\n                        \n                           F\n                           \n                           \u2212\n                           \n                           h\n                        \n                     ) and hardness-depth (\n                        \n                           H\n                           \n                           \u2212\n                           \n                           h\n                        \n                     ) relationships under surface nano-indentation, and hardness as a function of the distance from the irradiated sample surface (\n                        \n                           H\n                           \n                           \u2212\n                           \n                           x\n                        \n                     ) under cross-sectional nano-indentation.

Moreover, the evolution of different hardening mechanisms is addressed in details, which can help obtain a sophisticated comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms that result in irradiation hardening and indentation size effect."}{"On dynamic instability of magnetically embedded viscoelastic porous FG nanobeam ": "Dynamic instability of viscoelastic porous functionally graded (FG) nanobeam embedded on visco-Pasternak medium subjected to an axially oscillating loading as well as magnetic field is presented in this research. Porosity-dependent material properties of the porous nanobeam are described via a modified power-law function. Viscoelasticity of the nanostructure is considered based on the Kelvin\u2013Voigt model. Employing Eringen's differential law in conjunction with Timoshenko beam theory (TBT), the motion equations are derived via Hamilton's variational principle. Navier's solution as well as Bolotin's approach are utilized to obtain the dynamic instability region of viscoelastic porous FG nanobeam. Some benchmark results related to the effects of structural damping, length to thickness ratio, foundation type, nonlocal parameter (NP), static load factor, power-law index, porosity volume index and magnetic field on the instability region of porous FG nanobeam are evaluated. The results reveal that with increasing power-law index and structural damping, the pulsation frequency decreases and so, instability region shifts to left side while as magnetic field magnifies, the dynamic instability moves to right side. Also, it is represented that the porosity effect on the dynamic stability of FG nanobeam depends significantly on the values of power-low index and magnetic field."}{"Nonlocal nonlinear mechanics of imperfect carbon nanotubes ": "In this article, for the first time, a coupled nonlinear model incorporating scale influences is presented to simultaneously investigate the influences of viscoelasticity and geometrical imperfections on the nonlocal coupled mechanics of carbon nanotubes; large deformations, stress nonlocality and strain gradients are captured in the model. The Kelvin-Voigt model is also applied in order to ascertain the viscoelasticity effects on the mechanics of the initially imperfect nanoscale system. The modified coupled equations of motion are then derived via the Hamilton principle. A solution approach for the derived coupled equations is finally developed applying a decomposition-based procedure in conjunction with a continuation-based scheme. The significance of many parameters such as size parameters, initial imperfections, excitation parameters and linear and nonlinear damping effects in the nonlinear mechanical response of the initially imperfect viscoelastic carbon nanotube is assessed. The present results can be useful for nanoscale devices using carbon nanotubes since the viscoelasticity and geometrical imperfection are simultaneously included in the proposed model."}{"CRISPR-Cas9 system: A new-fangled dawn in gene editing ": "Till date, only three techniques namely Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN), Transcription-Activator Like Effector Nucleases (TALEN) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR-Associated 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) are available for targeted genome editing. CRISPR-Cas system is very efficient, fast, easy and cheap technique for achieving knock-out gene in the cell. CRISPR-Cas9 system refurbishes the targeted genome editing approach into a more expedient and competent way, thus facilitating proficient genome editing through embattled double-strand breaks in approximately any organism and cell type. The off-target effects of CRISPR Cas system has been circumnavigated by using paired nickases. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 has been used effectively for numerous purposes, like knock-out of a gene, regulation of endogenous gene expression, live-cell labelling of chromosomal loci, edition of single-stranded RNA and high-throughput gene screening. The execution of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has amplified the number of accessible scientific substitutes for studying gene function, thus enabling generation of CRISPR-based disease models.

The classical motor symptoms include resting tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability and are accompanied by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and Lewy pathology. Diminished neurotransmitter level, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and perturbed protein homeostasis over time worsen the disease manifestations in elderly people. Current management strategies aim to provide symptomatic relief and to slow down the disease progression. However, no pharmacological breakthrough has been made to protect dopaminergic neurons and associated motor circuitry components. Deep brain stimulation, stem cells-derived dopaminergic neurons transplantation, gene editing and gene transfer remain promising approaches for the potential management of neurodegenerative disease.

Once NLRs or ALRs are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the caspase-1 or -11 is activated by binding with NLRs or ALRs via its own unique cytosolic domains. As a result, caspase-1 or -11 enhances the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, which results in inflammation via the recruitment of immune cells, such as macrophages, and the promotion of programmed cell death mechanisms such as pyroptosis. In addition, the consistent cascades of inflammasomes would precede both minor and severe autoimmune diseases and cancers. The clinical relevance of inflammasomes in multiple forms of cancer highlights their therapeutic promise as molecular targets. To closely analyze the physiological roles of inflammasomes in cancers, here, we describe the fundamental knowledge regarding the current issues of inflammasomes in relevant cancers, and discuss possible therapeutic values in targeting these inflammasomes for the prevention and treatment of cancer."}{"MicroRNA-374a protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice by targeting the MAPK6 pathway ": "Aims\n                  Clinical treatment strategies for patients with myocardial ischemia typically include coronary artery recanalization to restore myocardial blood supply. However, myocardial reperfusion insult often induces oxidative stress and inflammation, which further leads to apoptosis and necrosis of myocardial cells. Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in the pathological and physiological processes associated with myocardial ischemia reperfusion.\n               \n               \n                  Main methods\n                  In this study, we established a myocardial H/R H9C2 cell model and a mouse I/R model to detect molecules implicated in myocardial I/R regulation and to determine the underlying signal transduction pathways.\n               \n               \n                  Key findings\n                  Herein, we showed that the expression of miR-374a-5p decreased in a myocardial cell model (H9C2 cells) of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) and mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Alternatively, overexpression of miR-374a-5p was found to ameliorate myocardial cell damage within both in vivo and in vitro models of ischemia. Further, mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) was identified as a direct target of miR-374a-5p. Thus, by targeting MAPK6, miR-374a-5p was found to negatively regulate MAPK6 expression. However, up-regulation of MAPK6 functioned to inhibit the previously observed protective effect of miR-374a-5p in the H9C2 H/R model.\n               \n               \n                  Significance\n                  Taken together, our study suggests that miR-374a-5p may have protective effects against cardiac I/R injury in vivo, and H/R injury in vitro, thereby providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms associated with ischemia/reperfusion injury and a potential novel therapeutic target."}{"Gene polymorphism and risk of idiopathic membranous nephropathy ": "Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most common primary glomerular disease (PGD) in the world. Currently, MN still lacks specific diagnostic markers and effective treatment strategy. It is speculated that the occurrence of MN is mainly related to environmental and genetic factors. The pathological manifestations of MN patients are diverse, significant differences in response to treatment options, and more reports on young MN patients suggest the importance of genes in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of MN. We will propose a novel perspective on the important role of genes in the pathogenesis of MN baced on the latest research."}{"The impact of tumor and gut microbiotas on cancer therapy: Beneficial or detrimental? ": "Cancer is a globally challenging health problem threatening mankind. Despite therapeutic advances in dealing with this malignancy, heterogeneous response and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents remain the hallmarks of cancer therapy. On the other hand, the involvement of the microbiota in affecting human health is well defined. An ever-growing body of evidence implicates the potential link between the microbiome and the efficacy of cancer therapies. Gut microbiota can modulate the metabolism of drugs in a number of ways. The presence of bacteria within the tumor environment can also impact the responses to cancer therapies; changing the chemical structure of chemotherapeutic drugs, affecting their activity, and local concentration. However, the underlying mechanisms by which gut and tumor microbial communities affect the response to cancer therapy are poorly understood and deciphering these mechanisms is of paramount importance. This review provides an overview of how gut and tumor microbiota might affect the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy and alleviate the adverse side effects of these therapies for the development of personalized and effective anticancer therapy."}{"Tackling Alzheimer's disease: Hypothetical synergism between anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic agents ": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the greatest global concerns. Current treatment of AD \u2013 the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors \u2013 provides temporary improvement of cognitive functions, but does not affect the core of the underlying pathological process. There is still the need for alternative approaches, preferably ones based on the upstream events in the AD pathogenesis. The nature of AD pathogenesis remains complicated and not entirely explained. It is assumed to comprise of many interrelated events which can sequentially lead to further pathologies \u2014 as a kind of vicious cycle. The solution in this case could be to interact with these processes on multiple levels at the same time. The proposed approach hopes to achieve the state of equilibrium between two pathological pathways via reducing their dynamics on appropriate levels. The first step is to inhibit Tumor Necrosis Factor signaling related to inflammatory response. The second is to take advantage of the influence of insulin signaling on amyloid-\u03b2 processing to restore its proper clearance. Employing two only partially-beneficial approaches into a novel approach aims at breaking the \u201cvicious cycle\u201d and eliciting synergistic effect via working on different levels simultaneously. The effect of such therapy could allow physicians to completely inhibit neural damage. The proposed strategy may prove easily introducible as an efficacious clinical approach employing novel anti-TNF agents in combination with anti-diabetic agents. Data is needed on its influence on cognitive functions, any occurrence of adverse effects, and the development of models of optimal doses and their temporal location."}{"Reciprocal enhancement of thrombosis by endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by iliac vein compression ": "Aims\n                  Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a pathophysiological change of vascular endothelium commonly seen in the cardiovascular system. Iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS) is known to be often associated with intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis. However, whether EndMT exists in IVCS has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between EndMT and thrombosis in IVCS.\n               \n               \n                  Main methods\n                  Using IVCS models in pig and mouse, we detected intimal changes and thrombus in stenotic iliac vein by immunofluorescence staining. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were stimulated by transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and thrombin, and cell phenotypic transition and antithrombotic function of HUVEC were examined through q-PCR, western blot and ELISA. In the end, by immunofluorescence staining, we observed the effect of anticoagulant on interstitial changes of venous endothelial cells in IVCS models.\n               \n               \n                  Key findings\n                  We showed that iliac vein compression induced EndMT, of which its inhibition reduced thrombus formation. Further studies showed that HUVECs undergoing EndMT lost their anticoagulation and thrombolytic function. Interestingly, thrombin aggravated EndMT through TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling. Moreover, compared with wild type (WT) mice, EndMT in stenotic iliac vein was reduced in WT mice fed with rivaroxaban or factor VII knockout mice, implying that anticoagulation alleviated EndMT in IVCS models.\n               \n               \n                  Significance\n                  Our findings indicate that EndMT and thrombosis reinforce reciprocally in IVCS, implying that targeting EndMT could be a potential strategy in prevention and treatment of thrombosis in IVCS."}{"Guanxin Danshen Formulation improved the effect of mesenchymal stem cells transplantation for the treatment of myocardial infarction probably via enhancing the engraftment ": "Although intravenous injection is the most convenient and feasible approach for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) delivery, the proportion of donor stem cells in the target myocardium after transplantation is small. It is believed that TCM enhances the effect of stem cell therapy by improving the hostile microenvironment and promoting the migration and survival of stem cells. Guanxin Danshen (GXDS) formulation is one of the main prescriptions for clinical treatment of ischemic heart diseases in China. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of GXDS formulation administration combined with MSCs transplantation on cardiac function improvement, apoptosis, angiogenesis and survival of transplanted cells in an acute model of acute myocardial infarction (MI). After being labeled with GFP, MSCs were transplanted via intravenous injection. Meanwhile, GXDS dripping pills were given by intragastric administration for 4\u202fweeks from 2\u202fdays before MI. Echocardiography showed moderate improvement in cardiac function after administration of GXDS formulation or intravenous transplantation of MSCs. However, GXDS formulation combined with MSCs transplantation significantly improved cardiac function after MI. The myocardial infarct size in rats treated with MSCs was similar to that in rats treated with GXDS formulation. However, GXDS formulation combined with MSCs transplantation significantly reduced infarction area. In addition, GXDS formulation combined with MSCs transplantation not only decreased cell apoptosis according to the TUNEL staining, but also enhanced angiogenesis in the peri-infarction and infarction area. Interestingly, the use of GXDS formulation increased the number of injected MSCs in the infarct area. Furthermore, GXDS formulation combined with MSCs transplantation increased SDF-1 levels in the infarcted area, but did not affect the expression of YAP. Our study provided a more feasible and accessible strategy to enhance the migration of stem cells after intravenous injection by oral administration of GXDS formulation. The combination of GXDS formulation and stem cell therapy has practical significance and application prospects in the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy such as MI."}{"Transdermal drug delivery systems in diabetes management: A review ": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease in which there is an insufficient production of insulin by the pancreas, or the insulin produced is unable to be utilized effectively by the body. Diabetes affects more than 415 million people globally and is estimated to strike about 642 million people in 2040. The WHO reported that diabetes will become the seventh biggest cause of mortality in 2030. Insulin injection and oral hypoglycemic agents remain the primary treatments in diabetes management. These often present with poor patient compliance. However, over the last decade, transdermal systems in diabetes management have gained increasing attention and emerged as a potential hope in diabetes management owing to the advantages that they offer as compared to invasive injection and oral dosage forms. This review presents the recent advances and developments in transdermal research to achieve better diabetes management. Different technologies and approaches have been explored and applied to the transdermal systems to optimize diabetes management. Studies have shown that these transdermal systems demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to oral administration due to the avoidance of first-pass hepatic metabolism and a sustained drug release pattern. Besides that, transdermal systems have the advantage of reducing dosing frequency as drugs are released at a predetermined rate and control blood glucose level over a prolonged time, contributing to better patient compliance. In summary, the transdermal system is a field worth exploring due to its significant advantages over oral route in administration of antidiabetic drugs and biosensing of blood glucose level to ensure better clinical outcomes in diabetes management."}{"Sprinkle formulations\u2014A review of commercially available products ": "Currently, sixty-five original sprinkle drug products are available in various dosage forms including tablets, powders, granules, immediate-release capsules, extended-release capsules, delayed-release capsules, and multiparticulate drug delivery systems. By sprinkling on soft food vehicles, these products provide dosing flexibility and convenience of administration, which potentially improve the compliance of patients with dysphagia. Due to these advantages, the growth of sprinkle products picked up since the 1990s, and several regulatory issues regarding this dosage form have been raised and documented. In this article, the types of sprinkle formulations were discussed by dividing them into seven categories, and the commercial products were summarized in terms of the drug substance, pharmaceutical excipients, storage conditions and administration methods. In addition, several US Food and Drug Administration guidelines related to the regulatory issues of sprinkle formulations were reviewed, which led to the conclusion that the future development of this promising dosage form demands integrated guidance for industry rather than scattered information in various documents."}{"Microsponges for dermatological applications: Perspectives and challenges ": "Dermatological disorders have a huge psychosocial impact, causing significant impairment of patient's life. Topical therapy plays a pivotal role in management of such disorders. Conventional topical delivery systems result in overmedication/undermedication, leading to adverse effects and reduction in therapeutic efficacy. Consequently, researchers have been striving towards the development of alternative delivery systems for dermatological applications. In the last decade, microsponges emerged as an attractive option for topical delivery. Their characteristic particle size offers enhanced benefits, making them superior to the contemporary microcarriers. The present review furnishes a comprehensive account of state of the art, important factors affecting the performance and mechanism of drug release from topically applied microsponges, along with characterization techniques.

The physicochemical characterization of nanophytosomes were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and also antioxidant activity, physical stability and antibacterial effects against food-borne pathogens i.e. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were investigated. Optimized GEO nanophytosomes showed promising results with the size of 115\u202fnm, loading capacity of 40%. The information on FT-IR indicated that the GEO were loaded into structure of nanophytosomes. Finally, an increase in antibacterial effect was observed for GEO nanophytosome. Yogurt was selected as a food model for sensory properties evaluation and the results showed insignificant difference among sample containing GEO loaded nanophytosomes and control. It can be concluded that GEO-nanophytosomes may be offered as an efficient natural food preservative."}{"Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Combretum erythrophyllum leaves and its antibacterial activities ": "A simple, green, cost effective and environmentally benign method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) using aqueous extract of Combretum erythrophyllum plant leaves as both the reducing and capping agents is herein reported for the first time. The as-prepared Ag-NPs were characterised using Ultraviolet\u2013Visible (UV\u2013Vis) absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. TEM image showed that the particles are spherical in shape, and well dispersed with the average particle diameter of 13.62\u202fnm.

Alumina-hydroxyapatite composites were prepared from natural phosphate ore in the presence of Al3+ ions via a wet-chemical method. Porous composites were characterized and the Al-surface modification was produced by facile and inexpensive route to uptake adjacent toxic species. Supplementary active sites on their surface may improve their phenol remediation. Nanocomposites exhibit higher phenol sorption rates than pure hydroxyapatite. It is concluded that the specific surface area, surface charge and Al content are suitable for phenol removal from aqueous solution using Alumina-hydroxyapatite composites. The results show that the retention power of these composites depends on a complex interaction between intermolecular and molecule-solid interactions. These findings are relevant to better understand the contribution of alumina content in Alumina-hydroxyapatite composites to the fate and uptake of phenol from aquatic environments."}{"Size-dependent antibacterial activity of copper nanoparticles against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae \u2013 A synthetic and mechanistic approach ": "Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (X. oryzae), causing devastating bacterial leaf blight (BLB) disease in rice, is fast developing resistance against many available antibiotics, warranting an urgent need to develop an alternative control strategy. In this manuscript, we report copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) as an effective antibacterial agent against X. oryzae. We synthesized four different sized CuNPs in a narrow-size range (CuNP-1 \u2013 18\u202fnm, CuNP-2 \u2013 24\u202fnm, CuNP-3 \u2013 28\u202fnm and CuNP-4 \u2013 33\u202fnm) by chemical reduction method. The physicochemical characterizations of CuNPs were done by X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV\u2013Visible Spectroscopy (UV\u2013Vis Spectroscopy) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The antibacterial activity of the CuNPs was found to be size and concentration dependent. Among all the CuNPs, CuNP-3 exerted the best antibacterial efficiency against X. oryzae due to the increased production of reactive oxygen radicals than the others. It also displayed increased activity compared to commercial antibiotic streptomycin sulphate."}{"Boundary lubrication properties and contact mechanism of carbon/MoS2 based nanolubricants under steel/steel contact ": "Lubrication mechanism of some carbon-based nanoparticles is unresolved and needs proper attention. In this work, friction and wear properties of carbon/MoS2 solid lubricants are tested in the boundary lubrication regime and further compared with oil-based binary and ternary nanolubricants. Results show that MWCNT and fullerene have high values of friction coefficient and wear rate in a dry medium. However, in lubricated medium with fomblin oil, they comply with the boundary lubrication mechanism and provide low friction and wear. The binary and ternary nanolubricants of oil-graphene, oil-MoS2, and oil-graphene-MoS2, oil-graphene-fullerene have provided enhanced wear and friction performance due to a build-up of a tribofilm between the contact zones. The interfacial contact mechanism depends on aggregation and particle rolling for dry and lubrication contact, respectively."}{"Synthesis of dimpled and submicron-sized polymer particles of different morphologies using free micromixer ": "Dimpled polymer particles are attracting significant attention because of their immense potential in varied applications. In this report, we propose a new method for synthesizing dimpled and submicron-sized polystyrene (PS) particles using a novel microfluidic device called the free micromixer (FMM). We could successfully synthesize dimpled and submicron-sized particles of various morphologies by controlling the concentration of PS and the temperature of the poor solvent used before mixing within the FMM. Formation of the particles can be attributed to the electrical charge of the polymer used for forming the particles."}{"Mild synthesis of single-nanosized plasmonic copper nanoparticles and their catalytic reduction of methylene blue ": "In this study, we report a mild synthesis of sub-10\u202fnm Cu nanoparticles (NPs) in ethylene glycol (EG) at room temperature using l-ascorbic acid (AA) as the reducing agent in the presence of 1-amino-2-propanol (AMIP). To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report of the room-temperature synthesis of sub-10\u202fnm Cu NPs using a nontoxic reducing agent. The as-prepared colloidal suspension of Cu NPs exhibited surface plasmon resonance absorption at 515\u202fnm. Transmission electron microscopy observations revealed well-dispersed spherical Cu NPs with an average particle size of 4.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8\u202fnm. The use of AMIP as a ligand was found to be critical to producing sub-10\u202fnm Cu NPs in EG under such mild conditions.

Such mixtures accordingly represent a model system for the further elaboration of soft-templated inorganic materials in totally anhydrous media. The aggregation behavior of four SFA species has been studied in two different organic and cyclic solvents in function of temperature by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). As long as the SFA-solvent mixtures remain in the liquid state, SAXS patterns reveal an aggregation behavior dependent on temperature and concentration, and on the internal structure of the SFA. We identify the relevant parameters governing the aggregation of these molecules based on the simulation of SAXS data versus temperature."}{"Development of sulfonate-functionalized hydroxyapatite nanoparticles for cadmium removal from aqueous solutions ": "Sulfonate-functionalized hydroxyapatite was successfully synthesized by organo-functionalization using natural phosphate and Benzenedisulfonate molecules. The modified apatites were characterized using multiple techniques, evidencing the effective incorporation of organo-functional groups into the hydroxyapatite matrix. Sulfonated mesoporous hydroxyapatite possesses a large amount of accessible -SO3 acid groups, which may be versatile adsorbents for the binding of Cd (II) cations. Stability issues of the sulfonated HAp nanocomposites for the specific reactions are addressed. The sulfonated hydroxyapatite nanopowders were evaluated cadmium removal from water.

It is already known that the composition of the surrounding fluid modifies the dried deposit. For superparamagnetic particles, recent studies showed that external magnetic fields can act as remote controls for those deposits. In this paper, we study the configuration space given by the interplay of such fields and a modification of the fluid composition by considering various concentrations of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). We show that the magnetic field modifies the morphological properties of the deposit, while the composition (i.e. PBS concentration) modifies the density profile of the deposit. We then present an explanation of these influences considering the competition between (i) sedimentation, (ii) coffee-ring and (iii) Marangoni flows. From these considerations, we propose a master curve which should be able to model the deposit densities of any system where the above mechanisms compete with each other."}{"Scanning the Industry 4.0: A Literature Review on Technologies for Manufacturing Systems ": "Industry 4.0 leads to the digitalization era.

Concrete mixtures were prepared with various contents of AR-GF typically 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 by weight of cement. The mixtures were cast and tested for compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths in accordance to ASTM standards. The experimental results showed that the strengths increase as fiber percentage increases until a threshold the compressive strength increased from 57.85 to 66.6\u202fMPa when fiber percentage increased from 0.0 to 1.2 respectively, the splitting tensile strength increased from 3.06 to 4.92\u202fMPa when fiber percentage increased from 0.0 to 1.2 respectively, and the flexural strength increased from 4.84 to 7.27\u202fMPa when fiber percentage increased from 0.0 to 1.2 respectively. In comparison with plain HSC control specimens that showed destructive sudden failure, the formation of cracks that led to failure in the specimens with AR-GF was gradual as the fiber percentage increases. Hence it can be concluded that the presence of fibers in HSC matrix has contributed towards controlling sudden crack formation and thus enhancing concrete ductility."}{"An optimized routing algorithm for vehicle ad-hoc networks ": "Efficient routing algorithms are essential to guarantee reliable communication in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs). In this paper, we present a twofold approach entailing the design of a new route metric for VANET communication, which considers important parameters such as the received signal strength; transmit power, frequency and the path loss. We further present an improved genetic algorithm-based route optimization technique (IGAROT) that guarantees better routing in VANETs. We used IGAROT to determine optimal routes required to communicate road anomalies effectively between vehicles in VANETs. The performance of our proposed algorithm was compared with the well-known conventional Genetic Algorithm (GA) route optimization technique under same simulation conditions. Based on the average route results obtained, our findings indicate that IGAROT provided 4.24%, 75.7% and 420% increment over the conventional GA in the low, medium and high car density scenarios, respectively. Our findings suggest that IGAROT improves road anomaly communication among vehicles thus enabling drivers to better navigate anomalous roads with the aim to reduce road-anomaly induced accidents. Further benefits of our system may include the prompt notification of road maintenance agencies concerning persisting road conditions via vehicle to infrastructure communication."}{"Anti-spoofing method for fingerprint recognition using patch based deep learning machine ": "Today\u2019s with increasing identity theft, biometric systems based on fingerprints have a growing importance in protection and access restrictions. Malicious users violate them by presenting fabricated attempts. For example, artificial fingerprints constructed by gelatin, Play-Doh and Silicone molds may be misused for access and identity fraud by forgers to clone fingerprints. This process is called spoofing. To detect such forgeries, some existing methods using handcrafted descriptors have been implemented for assuring user presence. Most of them give low accuracy rates in recognition. The proposed method used Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machines to recognize fingerprints accurately against fabricated materials used for spoofing."}{"A parametric heat flow model in the spherical earth ": "In this paper, we model the temperature profile of the Earth with two heat sources: the first is the interior source, generally understood by geophysicists as the primary, if not only, source; the second is a source closer to the surface, explained herein. The model temperature profiles with our chosen best-fit parameters are compared with data from the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) to examine the relative sizes of the two sources; the near-surface source is found to be much larger than the interior source. If correct, the near-surface source could explain a number of paradoxes involving the heat coming from the Earth that have until now not been resolved."}{"Geological and geophysical signatures of the East Pacific Rise 8\u00b0\u201310\u00b0N ": "The East Pacific Rise (EPR) 8\u00b0\u201310\u00b0N is an archetype for fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge (MOR), and has been one of the most comprehensively studied MOR sections for over four decades. It covers all orders of ridge discontinuities: first-order transform faults, second-order overlapping spreading centers, third-order small offset tectonic discontinuities, and fourth-order discontinuities of eruptive fissure zones. This section has been selected as a multi-disciplinary integrated study site because of its abundance of hydrothermal vents where scientists are investigating the linkages between mantle flow, crustal accretion, volcanic, hydrothermal, and biological processes that result in chemical and physical exchanges of energy and matter between the Earth's mantle and oceans. In particular, the segment near 9\u00b050\u2032N is one of the only two sites where repeated seafloor volcanic eruptions were onsite observed along the MOR. In this paper, we investigate the geological and geophysical signatures of the EPR 8\u00b0\u201310\u00b0N on behalf of the fast-spreading MOR, present the seismic signatures of the hydrothermal pathways through full waveform inversion, and put forward some thoughts on the remaining questions to be addressed. The skewness of mantle upwelling, on- and off-axis magmatism, are playing a critical role in shaping the crustal architecture. The spatial distribution and physical property of the crustal melt lens are mutually related to the hydrothermal system. The mechanism of hydrosphere-lithosphere interaction beneath the MOR is worth further studying. This compilation should be useful to investigators new to the MOR topic but we also target advanced researchers in presentation and synthesis of findings to date."}{"New progress on the onshore-offshore seismic survey in East China Continental Margin ": "The East China Continental Margin (ECCM) is an exemplified natural laboratory not only for studying the origin and evolution of trench-arc-basin system, but also for investigating the deformation mechanism within continent and its margins. For a better understanding on the structure and evolution of the ECCM, a NW\u2013SE trending onshore-offshore seismic profile was recently carried out there using controlled source wide-angle and passive broadband seismic experiments in combination. This 1050-km-long seismic profile transects the East China Sea Continental Shelf Basin (CSB), Zhemin Volcanic Belt, Lower Yangtze Block, and southern North China Craton from East China Sea to continental East China. Preliminary results, such as crustal reflected and refracted phases and P-wave receiver functions, show a good quality of the seismic data and tentatively delineate some first-order characteristics of the crustal structure of the ECCM. Expectably, more detailed crustal seismic velocity and geometric structures along the profile can be constructed by a further processing of the seismic data, and enable continuous and detailed comparisons of the crustal structure and inherent nature among different blocks, combined with other existing seismic profiles in the study region. And these further studies will provide reliable constraints on some controversial geologic issues, such as the origin of CSB, the contacting boundaries and collisional processes among Cathaysian Block, Yangtze and North China cratons."}{"Integrated groundwater potentials studies, aquifer hydraulic characterisation and vulnerability investigations of parts of Ndokwa, Niger Delta Basin, Nigeria ": "Field geological and geophysical (Vertical Electrical Sounding VES) survey data were used in investigating groundwater potentials, aquifer characteristics and vulnerability in parts of Ndokwa area, Niger Delta, Nigeria. Data from twenty-one (21) representative VES survey points using Schlumberger configuration were acquired, processed and interpreted. Pumping test data and litho-log data from existing boreholes in the area were used to constrain interpretation and correlation of the VES results. The results revealed five to six geo-electric layers/units across the study area. The subsurface lithology is predominantly sandstone intercalated, in some cases, with clay, sandy clay, and clayey sand. Results also revealed the average depth to aquifer as 71.91\u00a0m (10.33\u2013173.97\u00a0m); average aquifer thickness as 42.52\u00a0m (4.7\u2013149.7\u00a0m) and average aquifer resistivity value as 1289\u00a0\u03a9m (470.84\u20132697.7\u00a0\u03a9m). Average overburden thickness was estimated to be 28.53\u00a0m (4.28\u201362.44\u00a0m). Aquifer characteristics derived from the VES results gave average calculated aquifer transmissivity value as 1162.31\u00a0m2/day (129.54\u20134181.31\u00a0m2/day), and average calculated aquifer hydraulic conductivity as 27.28\u00a0m/day (25.69\u201328.92\u00a0m/day). Longitudinal conductance values range of 0.006\u20130.137 were recorded from geo-electric field survey data in the area, indicating dominance of sand and sparse distribution of clay; and suggesting that the Aquifer Protective Capacity APC of the overburden above the aquifers in the study area is mostly poor to weak and prone to contamination from infiltration. The DRASTIC model was applied to ascertain the DRASTIC Index and compute aquifer vulnerability distribution of the area; and it revealed that the study area is characterised by low \u2013 moderate \u2013 high vulnerability at different locations. Topsoil corrosivity studies showed that topsoil in the area is practically non-corrosive to slightly corrosive. The results of this study have implications for groundwater resources development and management in the study area."}{"Estimating sedimentary pile thickness, structural lineaments and heat flow in parts of North Central Nigeria from aeromagnetic data ": "Evaluation, analysis and interpretation of aeromagnetic data acquired over parts of North Central Nigeria were carried out in order to characterise structural features and lineaments, sedimentary pile thickness, geothermal gradient and heat flow in the study area. Fourier domain digital filtering and reduction to pole (RTP) operations were done to enhance the data, while spectral analysis and source parameter imaging (SPI) were used to analyse the data. Results from the 2-D spectral analysis of the enhanced magnetic data suggest that the depth range to the top of magnetic sources Zt is 0.33\u20130.73\u00a0km (average depth of 0.55\u00a0km); depth range to magnetic centroid Zo is 2.51\u20135.83\u00a0km (average depth of 3.94\u00a0km); Curie point depth range is 4.41\u201310.96\u00a0km (average depth of 7.32\u00a0km); and average sedimentary rock cover thickness is 3.94\u00a0km. This compares with the results from SPI which gave depth ranges to various magnetic sources as 0.27\u20133.01\u00a0km. Structural lineament analysis indicates the major trend of the structural lineament is in the NE\u2013SW, NW\u2013SE and NNE-SSW. Average geothermal gradient of 82.87\u00b0Ckm\u22121 and heat flow of 207.19\u00a0mWm\u22122 were estimated, with a general increase in heat flow from the southern parts towards the northern parts of the study area. These relatively high geothermal gradient and heat flow may be associated with the mineralogical, thermal and tectonic history of the area, suggesting the study area has the potential of geothermal energy."}{"\n               In-situ oxidation effect on pore size distribution in investigating adsorption properties under various geochemical conditions ": "Redox affected pumice tuff was used to investigate the changes of pore properties due to oxidation and its possible consequences to adsorption of nuclides on it. Porosity and pore size distribution were analyzed by mercury injection technique and scanning electron microscopy. Batch experiment was carried out with 1\u00a0cm3 block shaped intact pumice tuff samples to determine adsorption coefficient, K\n                     d at several pH, ionic strength and initial nuclide concentrations of stable cesium (133Cs). Pore area, surface area and specific surface area were determined from pore size distribution data before and after adsorption experiment and later compared between fresh and oxidized samples. The results showed that reduction of less than 0.33\u00a0\u03bcm size micro pores due to oxidation is mainly responsible for reducing surface areas, eventually reducing the sorption quantity. Influence of pore properties became negligible in redox affected pumice tuff indicating inverse relation of oxidation phenomena with adsorption coefficients values."}{"Trace element partitioning between MgAl2O4-spinel and carbonatitic silicate melt from 3 to 6\u00a0GPa, with emphasis on the role of cation order-disorder ": "To better understand the partitioning of trace elements between spinels and silicate melts at high P, a series of experiments have been conducted in the system CaO\u2013MgO\u2013Al2O3\u2013SiO2\u2013K2O\u2013CO2 at the P-T conditions of 3\u20136\u00a0GPa and 1500\u20131650\u00a0\u00b0C. These experiments successfully produced large MgAl2O4-spinel crystals coexisting with large carbonatitic silicate melt pools (plus large crystals of olivine and garnet in some cases). The experimental products were analyzed by using an electron microprobe in the wavelength-dispersive mode and an Agilent 7500 Ce laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which led to high-P partition coefficients for 34 elements. The results suggest that pressure may have nominal significant impacts on the partition coefficients of some trace elements such as Nb, Ta, Ti, and nearly all rare earth elements (REEs), with the partition coefficients varying in several orders of magnitudes, but may play negligible roles in the partitioning of U, Mn, Fe, Sr, Ba, Na, K, Rb, and etc. Further analyses have revealed that much of the nominal P effects can be assigned to the Mg\u2013Al cation order-disorder reaction. Cation exchange reactions are common in many geologically important minerals such as olivine, garnet, pyroxene, and plagioclase, and their effects on trace element partitioning should be extensively investigated in the near future before better understanding of the trace element partitioning systematics can be achieved. As one example, our experimental results have clearly demonstrated that due to much larger degrees of the Mg\u2013Al cation order-disorder triggered by high P, spinel can strongly fractionate the REEs (with some heavy REEs compatible in the spinels and thus depleted in the relevant magmas), a phenomenon conventionally attributed to the presence of garnet. Some other important conclusions from our experiments include that Cr (or Ni) in the spinel structure at Cr-poor (or Ni-poor) conditions may be not as compatible as conventionally thought for Cr-rich (or Ni-rich) conditions, and Fe isotopes may be fractionated by spinels at high P."}{"Design of dielectric elastomer actuators for vibration control at high frequencies ": "This study evaluates the basic characteristics of smart structures composed of dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) to suppress vibrations. A DEA, which is a lightweight, flexible polymer that can induce high deformations, should realize next-generation actuators. Additionally, DEA can achieve vibration control of structures with complex shapes or curved surfaces. Herein the performance and efficacy of DEAs are evaluated as an actuator for vibration control at high frequencies. First, the appropriate DEA structure is considered. Second, the control system for the smart structure using the DEA is modeled and designed as an actuator. Third, a method to determine DEA's optimum arrangement and shape is discussed by focusing on the structure's strain energy. Finally, a control simulation and a control experiment validate the vibration suppression effects and the efficacy of the DEA."}{"Application of neutron imaging to detect and quantify fatigue cracking ": "Non-destructive imaging techniques provide a unique opportunity to study crack initiation and propagation behaviour in structural materials. To evaluate the applicability of different volumetric imaging techniques, a round bar notched sample of duplex stainless steel was fatigue cracked and studied in situ and ex situ. Neutron and synchrotron X-ray tomography was used along with destructive methods and Bragg edge neutron imaging to evaluate the fatigue crack. Neutron attenuation tomography obtained a three-dimensional image in which the crack was readily identifiable. The neutron tomography, although lower in spatial resolution compared with the X-ray synchrotron tomography and requiring higher acquisition time, is sensitive to the phase chemistry, and has the potential to study engineering size components. Bragg edge neutron transmission imaging allows for the mapping of two-dimensional elastic strains and was used to identify the fatigue crack from the reduction in the strain in the region where the crack propagated. A finite element model of the cracked specimen was used to simulate the average through thickness strain that is measured by the Bragg edge neutron imaging technique. The strains measured in the ferritic phase correspond better with the simulation strains than the strain measured in the austenitic phase. It is concluded that this difference is due to strain partitioning, which is influenced by the strong texture present in the duplex steel."}{"A new material model for thermo-mechanical analysis of steels in fire ": "Recently developed multi-hazard frameworks for performance based engineering require material models capable of incorporating the unloading/reloading of structural materials at elevated temperatures. These include models for fire-following-earthquake events and the travelling fire methodology (which highlighted the prevalence of material\u2019s unloading/reloading). This paper proposes a new combined isotropic-kinematic hardening material model that has been developed to assess the unloading/loading behaviour of steel materials for thermo-mechanical analysis with fire, accounting for the Bauschinger effect and transient hardening behaviour. It works within the classical rate independent plasticity framework by exploiting the latitude of the two yield-surface model. The proposed material model integrates temperature effects on the yield surfaces through the concept of a shrinking/expanding bounding surface, and on the Bauschinger effect using an exponential growth function of plastic internal variables (PIVs). Transient hardening behaviour is modelled by incorporating a second non-linear kinematic hardening variable using an exponential decay function of the PIVs, and a corresponding discrete memory parameter tracks any abrupt changes in the direction of plastic loading. Describing the Bauschinger effect and its associated transient hardening behaviour using an opposite pair of exponential functions is a novel solution that simplifies the computing effort required by classical material models developed purposefully for cyclic loading. Hence it makes the proposed material model appropriate and efficient for structural analysis with fire. The proposed material model has been implemented in Abaqus using the Umat subroutine, and verified against experimental data where good agreement was observed. Its application in analysing structures subjected to complex, realistic building fire is also demonstrated, indicating that it is suitable for incorporating within performance based engineering frameworks for structures in fire."}{"Closed-form equation for natural frequencies of beams under full range of axial loads modeled with a spring-mass system ": "A new simple closed-form equation that accurately predicts the effect of an arbitrarily large constant axial load, residual stress or temperature shift on the natural frequencies of an uniform single-span beam, with various end conditions, is presented. Its accuracy and applicability range are studied by comparing its predictions with numerical simulations and with the approximate Galef\u2019s and Bokaian\u2019s formulas. The new equation may be understood as a refinement or extension of these two approximate formulas. Significant accuracy and applicability range improvements are achieved, especially near the buckling point and for large and moderate axial load. The new closed-form equation is applicable in the full range of axial load, i.e., from the buckling load to the tensioned-string limit. It also models well the beam-to-string transition region for the eight boundary conditions studied. It works remarkably well in the free-free and sliding-free cases, where it is a near-exact solution. In addition, it yields the natural frequencies of a 1-D spring-mass system that may be used to model tensioned beams, and potentially, more complex systems."}{"Mechanical behaviors of SLM additive manufactured octet-truss and truncated-octahedron lattice structures with uniform and taper beams ": "In this paper, three-dimensional lattice structures composed of octet-truss and truncated-octahedron unit cells with regular and tapered beams are proposed, and their mechanical properties are investigated through experiments and simulation comparisons. Firstly, analytical closed form expressions of the relative density functions are derived for different lattice structures. Secondly, in-situ compression samples are fabricated via Selective Laser Melting (SLM) 3D printing technique, monotonic compression experiments are performed for studying the effects of tapered beams on the mechanical properties of lattice structures with ordinary uniform beams, and SEM characterizations of fracture surface morphology are performed for understanding the underlying failure mechanisms. Afterwards, asymptotic homogenization (AH) method is used for evaluating the anisotropy properties of these lattice structures, closed form expression of the mechanical behaviors of unit cells is derived and solved with ABAQUS\u00ae using surface traction method. Asymptotic homogenization analysis shows that node enforcement can significantly enhance the modulus and reduce the anisotropy of the lattice."}{"Phase field modeling of fracture in fiber reinforced composite laminate ": "A new phase method for predicting crack propagation path and mechanical response of fiber reinforced composite laminate is proposed. A new three-dimensional (3D) crack surface density function considering material anisotropy is proposed for composite laminates. The explicit relationship between the model penalty parameter (MPP) in a standard anisotropic phase field method and the material properties is solved analytically. This relationship is then used to construct a new expression of driving force in phase field model to account for longitudinal, transverse normal and transverse shear cracks in composite laminates. The proposed method is implemented into the commercial software ABAQUS through user subroutine user defined element (UEL). Numerical methods on both two-dimensional (2D) lamina and 3D angle ply laminate are provided. The present predictions are in good agreement with the experimental and other numerical results."}{"Energy absorption of thin-walled tubes enhanced by lattice structures ": "Thin-walled structures filled or covered by various materials have been proposed for energy absorption applications in recent years. At this point, additive manufacturing technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to produce nontraditional low-density filler materials to further improve the energy absorption performance of thin-walled structures. With a similar motivation, novel hybrid structures, in which thin-walled tubes filled with periodic lattice materials, are proposed and the energy absorption behaviors of these structures are investigated under axial impact loading conditions. Two different types of lattice structures (i.e. body-centered cubic structure and body-centered cubic structure with vertical strut) are considered as filler materials, and the effects of number of lattice unit cell, diameter of lattice member and tube thickness on energy absorption characteristics of hybrid structures are examined using validated nonlinear finite element models. The results show that the tube and lattice structures contribute the buckling and bending resistance of each other during progressive deformation of hybrid structures, and a considerable enhancement in energy absorption performance could be achieved with appropriate selection of tube and filler lattice structure parameters. Particularly, the result revealed that the hybrid structures can absorb up to 115% higher impact energy compared with the sum of individual parts of hybrid structures. Besides, the hybrid structures also show promising performance in terms of crashworthiness parameters such as specific energy absorption and crash force efficiency, and thus these structures are recommended as potential candidates for crashworthiness applications."}{"A scaled boundary finite element method for bending analysis of fiber-reinforced piezoelectric laminated composite plates ": "The main purpose of this study is to develop a high performance numerical model for the analysis of the coupled electromechanical effects of the fiber-reinforced piezoelectric laminated composite plate under the mechanical or electric loading. Considering that the piezoelectric laminated plate is made of N orthotropic layers with the material axes oriented arbitrarily with respect to the laminate coordinate, the three-dimensional (3D) theory of elasticity for the kth orthotropic (piezoelectric) lamina is applied for the establishment of the mathematic model by using the elastic displacements and the electric potential as the nodal degree of freedom. The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) coupling with the precise integration technique (PIT) are used to obtain the solution. Under the formulations of the SBFEM, only the in-plane of the plate structure is discretized into two-dimensional (2D) elements thus the spatial dimension is reduced by one. By introducing a dual vector of the internal nodal force, the SBFEM governing equation is described as an analytic formulation along the through-thickness with a matrix exponential function which can be estimated with high accuracy using the PIT. In addition, the high order spectral element is applied for the description of the basic variables so that the laminate with the complicated curved boundaries can be accurately determined. At the same time, assuming that the generalized displacement field is a quadratic function with respect to the thickness coordinate of each layer, then the generalized strain and stress fields can be determined directly based on the strain-displacement relations and the constitutive relations in the scaled boundary coordinate system. Numerical results show that a good agreement can be achieved with few discrete nodes for both the thin and moderately thick piezoelectric laminated plate under different types of loads through comparison with the 3D exact solutions and good performance has also been validated. Moreover, two numerical examples including a square piezoelectric laminated plate with the complex configuration (involving the fiber orientation and the distribution of piezoelectric layers) and a circular/annular piezoelectric laminated plate are further discussed to demonstrate the applicability of the present formulations."}{"Residual flexural properties of CFRP sandwich structures with aluminum honeycomb cores after low-velocity impact ": "This paper aims to evaluate the influences of impact-induced damage on the residual flexural strength of honeycomb core sandwich panels with different structural configurations by combining the experimental, numerical and theoretical methods. Low-velocity impact tests and three-point bending tests after impact are carried out to determine and quantify the effects of structural configuration and impact energy on the impact damage and residual flexural strength of such structures. Subsequently, an integrated FE model with the VUMAT subroutine is developed to further investigate the damage states and failure mechanisms for the impact and bending simulation. The numerical results match well with the experimental ones in terms of impact load, absorbed energy, residual flexural strength and failure mechanisms. Results indicate that increasing cell wall thickness or decreasing side length of honeycomb core has significant effects on peak load, while increasing core height has little effect. Specimens with lower core stiffness fail through core buckling and crushing under the bending load, while specimen with higher core stiffness fails by top face sheet fracture. The residual flexural strength reduces markedly even through the impact damage is barely visible, indicating that it has a strong correlation with impact energy and structural configuration of cores."}{"Crushing behaviors of hierarchical sandwich-walled columns ": "Hierarchical structures have better mechanical properties as a widely observed organization form in nature. In this paper, a series of sandwich-walled columns (SWCs) with different sandwich cells are proposed based on hierarchical route for obtaining more weight-effective protective structures. The finite element model is firstly validated via experiment testing. Then, the crushing behaviors of SWCs, regular multi-cell columns (MCs) and single-cell column (SC) under axial load are analyzed. The results show that the hierarchical sandwich design has more remarkable potential to improve mechanical behavior than regular multi-cell design, and the effect of hierarchical level N is significant for the mechanical properties. Next, the theoretical models of mean crushing force (Fm), specific energy absorption (SEA) are derived to deeply analyze the collapsing mechanism of the SWCs, and the low errors of the theoretical predictions indicate their high accuracy. Furthermore, the technique for ordering preferences by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) evaluates the crashworthiness performances of all thin-walled structures, the square sandwich cell with N\u202f=\u202f6 (S-6) is selected because of its ideal cross-section, and the wall thickness range for optimal crashworthiness in feasible design space is identified. This study offers a novel idea of designing lightweight structure with high energy absorption capacity for the crashworthy requirement."}{"An analytical solution for elastic buckling analysis of stiffened panel subjected to pure bending ": "In this study, an analytical solution has been developed for the elastic buckling analysis of stiffened panels subjected to pure bending, and the effect of main geometric parameters of the stiffened panels on buckling strength has been investigated. A simplified model of stiffened panels has been proposed for buckling analysis, where an elastically built-in boundary condition replaces the skin's effect on buckling of the stiffened panels. The equilibrium method with a conventional rigid skin assumption and a new flexible skin assumption is developed for the simplified model to analytically capture the buckling behaviour of the stiffened panels. To consider the non-rigid rotation effect of flexible skin on buckling of stiffened panels, a new parameter, the effective width of stiffened panels, has been introduced, and a finite element (FE) assisted method has been employed to obtain its value for different stiffened panels. The results show that the flexible skin assumption significantly enhances the accuracy of buckling strength prediction compared with the conventional rigid skin assumption, and the maximum difference between analytical results and corresponding FE simulations is decreased from 12.2% with rigid skin assumption to only 3.9%. Based on the proposed analytical solution, effects of main geometric parameters of the stiffened panels (the stiffened panel length and width, the stiffener height, and the ratio of the skin thickness to the stiffener thickness) on their buckling coefficients have been discussed. Increasing stiffened panel length and/or reciprocal of stiffener height leads to an initial abrupt decrease of the buckling coefficient until reaching a stable level. When the stiffened panel width increases, the buckling coefficient first increases and then remains stable, whereas increasing thickness ratio leads to the increase of the buckling coefficient."}{"Modelling of ventilation and dust control effects during tunnel construction ": "A large amount of dust is mainly generated during the construction of the shield tunneling machine. In order to achieve the optimal dust removal effect, this research took the shield section of Jiaozhou North Station of Qingdao Metro Line No. 8 to Jiaodong Airport Station (China) as a case study. For this purpose, the numerical simulation and orthogonal design were undertaken to optimize the parameters of the ventilation and dust removal system for a shield tunneling machine, and to study the influence of each parameter on the dust removal from three aspects, including the distance of pressure tuyere, the air volume of the pressure tuyere, and the distance of the air inlet. The results of the analysis showed that the distance of the pressure tuyere is the main parameter to control the dust removal, and the two other factors had both less influence on the dust removal. The numerical simulation of the optimal method showed that it outperformed on dust removal than the actual working conditions. This research provided a theoretical basis and direction for optimizing the performance of a ventilation and dust removal system."}{"Mechanical properties and energy absorption capability of AuxHex structure under in-plane compression: Theoretical and experimental studies ": "The architected mechanical metamaterials have garnered significant research attention for a variety of engineering application due to their remarkable mechanical properties and unique deformation behavior. Herein, the in-plane uniaxial compressive response and energy absorption capacity of a novel hybrid configuration, AuxHex structure, which consists of auxetic and hexagonal honeycomb cells, are systematically investigated through theoretical, finite element simulation and experimental methods. A series of AuxHex sandwich core panels have been fabricated with nylon material by using additive manufacturing route. The relationships for Young's modulus and plastic collapse stress along different loading directions are derived and validated through the comparative analysis. In addition, the deformation mechanism and failure modes of the AuxHex structure have also been discussed in detail. The AuxHex structures have exhibited superior Young's modulus, collapse strength and energy absorption than traditional honeycomb structures. In the x-direction, the energy absorption capacity was improved by 38%, which can be attributed to the uniform and stable deformation mode of the unit cell. The theoretical prediction results of Young's modulus and plastic collapse stress are consistent with finite element simulation and experimental results. The AuxHex structures demonstrate a novel design strategy for the architected metamaterials through the combination of various cellular cells. The hybrid structures will play an important role in both the load-bearing and energy-absorbing applications, and it demonstrates a novel design strategy for the architected metamaterials through the combination of various cellular cells."}{"Closed-form solutions to optimal parameters of dynamic vibration absorbers with negative stiffness under harmonic and transient excitation ": "In this present paper, two configurations of dynamic vibration absorber in conjunction with negative stiffness (NSDVA) are investigated and their parameter optimization is conducted according to two tuning methodologies: the fixed points theory and the stability maximization criterion. Closed-form solutions to the optimal parameters of NSDVAs are analytically derived and are expressed in terms of ratio between the negative stiffness and mechanical stiffness of primary system. Allowable bounds on negative stiffness are specified with the consideration of stability requirement, based on which the ultimate control performance of NSDVAs could be imagined. Furthermore, an optimal negative stiffness ratio is defined within the stable region when the NSDVAs are tuned by the fixed points theory. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out in both harmonic and free vibration scenarios. Simulation results suggest that the inclusion of negative stiffness in the coupled system can significantly improve the vibration control performance in terms of broadening the frequency bandwidth of vibration suppression, decreasing the peak vibration amplitude of primary system and confining the stroke length of NSDVAs. Meanwhile, the negative stiffness can enhance the damping capability of coupled system, engendering an accelerated convergence of transient disturbances."}{"Circular use of plastics-transformation of existing petrochemical clusters into thermochemical recycling plants with 100% plastics recovery ": "Plastics represent a serious waste-handling problem, with only 10% of the plastic waste (PW) generated world-wide being recycled. The remainder follows a linear economy model, involving disposal or incineration. Thermochemical recycling provides an opportunity to close the material cycle, and this work shows how this can be achieved using the existing petrochemical infrastructure. The transformation of a generic petrochemical cluster based on virgin fossil feedstocks into a cluster that is based on PW has the following proposed sequence: (1) the feedstock is partially replaced (45% on carbon basis) by PW; (2) the feedstock is totally replaced by PW; (3) the process undergoes electrification; and (4) oxy-combustion and carbon capture and storage are introduced to achieve 100% carbon recovery in the form of monomers or permanent storage. An alternative transformation pathway that includes the introduction of biomass is also considered. The energy and carbon balances of the proposed implementation steps are resolved, and cost estimates of the savings related to the feedstock and required investments are presented. The main conclusion drawn is that switching the feedstock from virgin fossil fuels to PW (Implementation steps 1 and 2) confers economic advantages. However, the subsequent transformation steps (Implementation steps 3 and 4) can only be justified if a value is assigned to the environmental benefits, e.g., CO2 savings, increased share of biogenic carbon in plastic products, increasing recycling quotas, and/or the potential of the process to compensate for the intermittency of renewable power. It is also discussed how utilisation of the diverse compositions of PW streams by additional processes can meet the other demands of a chemical cluster."}{"Research gaps in environmental life cycle assessments of lithium ion batteries for grid-scale stationary energy storage systems: End-of-life options and other issues ": "Although deployments of grid-scale stationary lithium ion battery energy storage systems are accelerating, the environmental impacts of this new infrastructure class are not well studied. To date, a small literature of environmental life cycle assessments (LCAs) and related studies has examined associated environmental impacts, but they rely on a variety of methods and system boundaries rather than a consistent approach. The large LCA literature of transportation applications of LIB contains selected life-cycle inventory data relevant for stationary ESSs, but does not incorporate characteristics unique to stationary systems, such as balance of system materials; operational profiles; and perhaps even different end-of-life (EOL) phase needs. This critical literature review surveys the existing studies on grid-scale stationary LIB ESS, and highlights research gaps concerning comprehensive environmental impacts. Further analysis specific to grid-connected LIB systems \u2013 encompassing use phase (battery operation) and EOL, in addition to production phase \u2013 is required for a robust assessment of environmental impacts of grid-connected energy storage in LIB systems. For example, thus far studies that systematically evaluate the consequential impact of storage system operation have been focused on energy arbitrage and frequency regulation applications. Future work should consider the impact of ESS providing other grid services as well. Although EOL costs and impacts for stationary LIB ESSs are an important consideration for prospective asset owners and key users of grid-scale ESS (such as electric utility companies and project developers), they are not yet addressed in the literature."}{"Recent advances in high energy-density cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries ": "Large-scale energy storage technologies are in great demands for the enhanced power grid efficiency and wide renewable energy source applications. Various electrochemical energy storage devices, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) et al. with long operating life and high energy conversion efficiency, have achieved rapid growth in the past 30\u202fyears, which make them the best choice for the large energy storage applications. Recently, SIBs have been proposed as the most promising solution for the large-scale energy storage systems because of the huge abundant and low cost of sodium resources. High energy-density cathode materials are now the main limits for high performance SIBs. Herein, the advances made in high energy-density cathodes for SIBs, together with the sodium storage mechanism; the remaining challenges and perspectives for high energy-density cathode materials, are discussed thoroughly based on recent researches and publications. Meanwhile, the achievement of material simulations in the design and development of cathode materials for SIBs, especially the high-throughput strategy and data science, is also introduced. This review is expected to accelerate the progress on SIB studies for high energy-density cathode materials, and more importantly, open up new opportunities for the high-energy cathode materials design in sodium storage."}{"Alkali-activated soapstone waste - Mechanical properties, durability, and economic prospects ": "Soapstone is a soft, magnesium-rich mineral widely used in the production of carved objects and architectural elements, for instance. The processing of soapstone causes the formation of significant amounts of waste powder, which is largely landfilled at the moment. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the suitability of soapstone waste as the main binder for the alkali-activation process using sodium silicate and hydroxide solutions as activators. The results demonstrate that soapstone alone reacts to some extent (compressive strength of 13\u202fMPa at 28\u202fday age), but mechanical properties are improved significantly after replacing 20% of soapstone by metakaolin (compressive strength of 31\u202fMPa at 28 d age). The obtained mechanical properties are closely similar to those of virgin soapstone. Durability properties of the developed alkali-activated binders were similar or better than typical Portland cement-based binders in terms of high temperature, acid, and freeze-thaw resistance, and sorptivity. The material costs alkali-activated soapstone mortar were estimated as approximately 70 \u20ac/t. Thus, the results enable utilizing currently underexploited soapstone waste in a sustainable and economically interesting way."}{"Aqueous solution discharge of cylindrical lithium-ion cells ": "The development of mass-market electric vehicles (EVs) using lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is helping to propel growth in LIB usage, but end-of-life strategies for LIBs are not well developed. An important aspect of waste LIB processing is the stabilisation of such high energy-density devices, and energy discharge is an obvious way to achieve this. Salt-water electrochemical discharge is often mentioned as the initial step in many LIB recycling studies, but the details of the process itself have not often been mentioned. This study presents systematic discharge characteristics of different saline and basic solutions using identical, fully charged LIB cells. A total of 26 different ionic solutes with sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and ammonium (NH4\n                     +) cations have been tested here using a fixed weight percentage concentration. An evaluation of possible reactions has also been carried out here. The results show good discharge for many of the salts, without significant damaging visual corrosion. The halide salts (Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212) show rapid corrosion of the positive terminal, as does sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3), and the solution penetrates the cell can. Mildly acidic solutions do not appear to cause significant damage to the cell can. The most alkaline solutions (NaOH and K3PO4) appear to penetrate the cell without any clear visual damage at the terminals. Depending on what is desired by the discharge (i.e. complete cell destruction and stabilisation or potential re-use or materials recovery), discharge of individual Li-ion cells using aqueous solutions holds clear promise for scaled-up and safe industrial processes."}{"Solid polymer electrolytes based on lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide/poly(vinylidene fluoride -co-hexafluoropropylene) for safer rechargeable lithium-ion batteries ": "The increasing use of electronic portable systems and the consequent energy demand, leads to the need to improve energy storage systems. According to that and due to safety issues, high-performance non-flammable electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) are needed.\n                  SPE containing different amounts of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), PVDF-HFP, polymer matrix have been prepared by solvent casting. The addition of LiTFSI into PVDF-HFP allows to tailor thermal, mechanical and electrical properties of the composite.\n                  In particular, the ionic conductivity of the composites increases with LiTFSI content, the best ionic conductivities of 0.0011\u202fmS/cm at 25\u202f\u00b0C and 0.23\u202fmS/cm at 90\u202f\u00b0C were obtained for the PVDF-HFP/LiTFSI composites with 80\u202fwt% of LiTFSI.\n                  This solid electrolyte allows the fabrication of Li metallic/SPE/C-LiFePO4 half-cells with a discharge capacity of 51.2\u202fmAh/g at C/20. Further, theoretical simulations show that the discharge capacity value depends on the lithium concentration and percentage of free ions and is independent of the solid polymer electrolyte thickness. On the other hand, the voltage plateau depends on the SPE thickness. Thus, a solid electrolyte is presented for the next generation of safer solid-state batteries."}{"Characterisation and properties of visible light-active bismuth oxide-titania composite photocatalysts ": "Bismuth oxide \u2013 titanium dioxide composite materials were produced by pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering onto two types of commercially available titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The use of an oscillating bowl enabled deposition of bismuth oxide uniformly onto loose powders, in contrast to solid substrates typically used for the conventional magnetron sputtering processes. Variation of the deposition time allowed the production of composite materials with different amounts of bismuth oxide. The composite materials, as well as uncoated titania powders, were extensively analysed by a range of analytical techniques, including SEM/EDX, XRD, BET, XPS, TEM and UV\u2013visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Photocatalytic properties of the materials were assessed under simulated visible light irradiation via degradation of acetone and methanol through measurements of carbon dioxide evolution. Additionally, the composite materials were characterised with a newly developed technique of reversed double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy in order to obtain information on the distribution of electron traps. Bismuth oxide was found in crystalline \u03b2-Bi2O3 form on both types of substrates without any additional heat treatment applied. Though the distribution of bismuth oxide on titanium dioxide was found to depend strongly on particle size and deposition time used, the composite materials exhibited significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity compared to either of the commercial titania materials used as a substrate."}{"The formation and effect of defect dipoles in lead-free piezoelectric ceramics: A review ": "As one of the most crucial intrinsic contributions, defect dipoles show unique and prominent influence on the responsive behavior of piezoelectric ceramics. Here, we present the formation of the defect dipoles and the state-of-the-art effect on lead-free piezoelectric ceramics in detail. First, the formation of defect dipoles in ceramics are demonstrated. The coupling effect between defect dipole polarization and normal ferroelectric spontaneous polarization, which results in the unusual ferroelectric properties (e.g., \u201cpinched\u201d or asymmetric polarization hysteresis loops) and high electric field induced-strain performance in piezoelectric ceramics, is elaborated. Thereafter, we systematically introduce the switching and decoupling process of defect dipoles under different external conditions. Finally, the researches about the effect of defect dipoles on various lead-free piezoelectric ceramics are presented herein, with special attention on the three systems: the barium titanate, sodium-bismuth titanate and potassium sodium niobate. The remaining challenges, however, such as weak temperature/cycling stability, still need further effort for the extensive applications of these materials."}{"Recycling of spent NiMH batteries: Integration of battery leach solution into primary Ni production using solvent extraction ": "The utilization of existing metallurgical infrastructure and integration of secondary process streams into primary metals production can provide advantages over separate recycling plants. This paper focuses on the integration of a pregnant leach solution (PLS) into a nickel production plant that contains Ni, Co, Zn, Mn, Fe, Al and Cd ions, derived from a NiMH recycling stream. The solution composition highlights the challenge related to spent battery investigations, as although toxic Cd is not present in NiMH battery chemistries, it ends up into the battery waste collection and prevents direct integration of the battery waste into the primary process. The aim of the study is to remove Zn, Fe, Al, Mn and Cd ions from the PLS, so that the Ni and Co remaining in solution could be integrated into the nickel production process. A two-step solvent extraction process using Di-2-ethylheyxl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) was developed. In the first step, Zn, Al and Fe were removed at pH\u202f1.5, whereas in the second step Cd and Mn were removed at pH\u202f2.3. Different process parameters (pH, O/A ratio, temperature, extractant concentration, kinetics) were optimized at each step of the solvent extraction. The purified and fully integrable PLS was found to contain Ni ~28\u202fg/L and Co ~3.7\u202fg/L."}{"Gold nanoparticle based photothermal therapy: Development and application for effective cancer treatment ": "Recent advances in nanomedicine make it auspicious for cancer diagnosis and treatment. A possible non-invasive photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancer treatment could be constructed by combining the nanomedicine and laser. PTT employs photothermal agents (PTAs) with high photothermal conversion efficacy for converting light into heat to selectively kill cancer cells under the help of lasers. Because of the unique Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) phenomenon and the tunable near-infrared (NIR) region absorption, noble metal nanoparticles like gold nanoparticles can be applied as a PTA for PTT. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) offer the enhanced absorption and scattering properties, the optical properties tunability, and specific tumor targeting capability, therefore, AuNPs based PTT turns to be furthermore promising. However, drawbacks such as long retention time, cytotoxicity, and insufficient cancer cells targeting restrict the application of AuNPs as PTTs. This review overviews research of the PTT applications of various modified AuNPs in previous publications. With the advancement of chemical synthesis technology, AuNPs of various shapes and sizes can be synthesized with desired properties, which can achieve multimodal cancer treatment with enhanced anti- tumor effect. In this review, we summarized the major features of five principal types of AuNPs: gold nanorods, gold nanoshells, gold nanospheres, gold nanocages, and gold nanostars with different sizes, discussed their advantages and disadvantages in PTT. We also detailed the surface modification of AuNPs which could be beneficial for the performance of AuNPs based PTT. In addition, depending on properties of AuNPs and lasers, the underlying mechanism of cell death triggered by NIR laser can be different, which also affects the anti-cancer effects and outcomes of PTT. However, controlling cell death through a desired cell death mechanism to achieve desired PTT outcome is still a challenge."}{"Impact of MOF defects on the binary adsorption of CO2 and water in UiO-66 ": "Metal organic frameworks are frequently examined as potential solutions to complex gas phase separations problems. In many cases, the gas phase adsorption properties of these materials are quantified using single component gas adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments. In adsorption separations, however, it is common that the adsorbent participates in a multicomponent adsorption event. In the literature there is a general absence of multicomponent adsorption data with most data predicted via the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory or molecular simulations. Therefore, in this work, binary adsorption data of CO2 and water on UiO-66 were measured experimentally using a volumetric method at three different water loadings. Molecular simulations of isotherms were compared to the experimental measurements and the impact of two different MOF defect sites on the multicomponent CO2/H2O adsorption behavior was determined. The experimental data show a slight enhancement of CO2 loading when CO2 is co-adsorbed with water, which is a result that was confirmed via molecular simulations. Also, the simulation results show that defect sites can have a greater influence on low-pressure CO2 adsorption in MOFs than the co-adsorption of water. Furthermore, the simulations provide a molecular-level understanding of the role of these defects on the single and binary adsorption behavior."}{"Comprehensive analytical model for polarization curve of a PEM fuel cell and experimental validation ": "The kinetics of cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is significantly modulated by the resistances for transport of reactants to the catalytic sites offered by different components of the fuel cell. This modulation governs the polarization curve of the PEMFC. Consequently, the various operating, geometric and material parameters of the fuel cell dictate the polarization curve. The effects of these parameters on the polarization curve over the entire range of current density, from zero to limiting current, can be predicted using detailed numerical simulations, which are however expensive. Analytical models, although simple can capture the essential details of physico-chemical processes occurring inside a PEMFC and are significantly inexpensive. In this article, we derive an analytical equation of the polarization curve which is valid over the entire range of current density. Specifically, the representative situation of a humidified low temperature PEMFC is considered wherein oxygen transport resistance in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) is encountered at lower current density than proton transport resistance in the CCL. A novel experimental methodology is illustrated to confirm that this is indeed the case. Next, we elucidate a procedure to determine in-situ oxygen diffusion coefficients in the various domains of an operational PEMFC. Finally, it is shown that the analytical polarization curve predicted using these parameters is in excellent agreement with the experimental and numerically simulated polarization curves over the entire range of current density. The significance of this work is that the analytical model relates the performance of a PEMFC to all operating and geometric parameters as well as the average transport and kinetic properties of the materials used in its different components, without the need for computationally expensive numerical simulations. The model can therefore provide useful insights for enhancing the performance of PEMFC in different regimes of current density as well as for diagnostic purposes."}{"Copper sulfide-macroporous polyacrylamide hydrogel for solar steam generation ": "The use of abundant solar energy to produce clean water by a solar steam generation device is a promising strategy to solve the long-term water and energy shortage. The development and application of photothermal materials are an effective way to improve solar photothermal conversion efficiency of the device. Herein, an inorganic-organic light-absorbing material, copper sulfide-macroporous polyacrylamide hydrogel (CuS-m-PAM), is reported for the first time. The CuS-m-PAM was prepared by in-situ synthesis method via loading CuS nanoparticles into macroporous polyacrylamide hydrogel (m-PAM). CuS-m-PAM forms a heating zone at the air-water interface and CuS nanoparticles can efficiently convert the strongly absorbed light into localized heat, thus reducing the heat loss in the transfer process. The results demonstrate that the solar photothermal conversion efficiency of CuS-m-PAM-0.05 is the highest and can reach 92% under one sun illumination (1000\u202fW\u202fm\u22122). The rough surface of m-PAM and the plasma resonance effect of CuS nanoparticles improve the absorb ability to sunlight. The open macroporous structure of m-PAM also makes a great contribution to the water vapor escape of solar steam generation device. Moreover, the formation of N-Cu bond in CuS-m-PAM makes CuS nanoparticles more stabilization, and the solar photothermal conversion efficiency of CuS-m-PAM-0.05 remains 87.5% after 50 cycles of tests. CuS-m-PAM, as a novel light-absorbing material, can comprehensively optimize the solar steam generation device in light absorption, thermal insulation, water replenishment and steam exhaust, and thus provides a new practical method for maximum utilization of solar steam generation device."}{"Experimental and numerical study of cavitation flows in venturi tubes: From CFD to an empirical model ": "This work is devoted to experimental and numerical studies of cavitation phenomena in Venturi tubes with different geometries. A two-phase mixture model has been validated against experimental data. The numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental data. Experimental studies have been carried out for two different Venturi tubes with convergent angles of 19\n                        \n                           \u00b0\n                        \n                      and 45\n                        \n                           \u00b0\n                        \n                     , respectively. The effect of the convergent angle on the cavitation performance was investigated experimentally and numerically. Both the numerical and experimental studies reveal that the change in the convergent angle has significant effects on flow characteristics and the generation of cavitation. It was shown that a 45\n                        \n                           \u00b0\n                        \n                      convergent angle enhances cavitation in comparison with 19\n                        \n                           \u00b0\n                        \n                      angle. A scaled-up study of the Venturi geometry has been conducted using CFD-based numerical simulations. Finally, a semi-empirical model enabling the prediction of cavitation in Venturi tubes has been developed and validated."}{"Confinement of Fe2O3 nanoparticles in the shell of N-doped carbon hollow microsphere for efficient oxygen reduction reaction ": "Fe2O3 nanoparticles is confined in the mesoporous shell of N-doped carbon microsphere for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A series of hollow catalysts together with corresponding control samples have been constructed, characterized and evaluated. The structure, composition and state of the as-prepared catalysts were characterized by Scanning electron microscope, Transmission electron microscope, X-Ray diffraction, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The electrochemical activity and selectivity of Fe2O3-based catalyst toward the 4e\u2212 pathway has been greatly improved (Eonset of \u221250\u202fmV, E1/2 of \u2212150\u202fmV and average electron transfer number of 3.87). The current density is 18.5% higher than that of commercial 20\u202fwt% Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the confinement of Fe2O3 nanoparticles in the interlayer of N-doped graphite can significantly promote the activity of N-doped graphitic surface in alkaline media for ORR, due to facilitated O2 adsorption and reduced energy of OOH formation which is the rate-determining step of ORR. Such a confinement strategy provides a general and effective route to push the limit of transition metal oxides to a higher level for ORR and realize the controllable construction of highly active non-noble-metal catalysts with well-defined mechanism understanding."}{"Gas-liquid-liquid multiphase flow in microfluidic systems \u2013 A review ": "Gas-liquid-liquid (G/L/L) multiphase flow in microfluidic system has been a vital part of microfluidics, micro-chemical and micro-analysis in recent years. Microfluidics has emerged as a useful tool to prepare G/L/L that affords improved control over the micro-scale structure. With the aid of clever and efficient device designs, precise regulation of the size, shape and components can be realized. Existing results have shown that G/L/L multiphase micro-flow exhibits more complicated laws and unique characteristics in flow, transport and reactions compared with liquid-liquid or gas-liquid two-phase flow, allowing the optimal and more efficient control of the process. In this review, focused on the G/L/L multiphase flow in microfluidic systems, we recount the historical development of this system and approach, along with the state-of-the-art, including discussion of microfluidic devices (lithographically defined devices and capillary/needle-based devices) and microchannel type (cross-junction, flow-focusing, dual-coaxial, etc.) used to form and prepare G/L/L multiphase mixtures. Discussion is also extended to scaling laws and numerical simulations used to predict the size of microbubbles or droplets. In addition, flow and mass transfer characteristics, as well as applications and scale-up, are also discussed. Finally, the future trends in the development of G/L/L multiphase flow are addressed, emphasizing some directions worth detailed study and remaining challenges in the field."}{"Water in nanotubes: The surface effect ": "Recent advances in nanotube synthesis and functionalization have allowed for new insights into several physical-chemical aspects of nanofluidics. Processes thought possible only in theory are now attainable experimentally. This raises new questions about the distinctions between fluid behavior in bulk or under extreme confinement. Particularly, the interaction between water molecules and the nanotube wall is expected to play a major role in fluid structure and dynamics. In fact, the very definition of surface hydrophobicity is a sensitive subject, which demands further investigation. Here we present an overview of how changes in interaction and confining distances between water molecules and the nanotube wall can induce freezing, wet/dry transitions and even produce high flow rates. We suggest that the changes in water dynamics due to wall\u2019s nature (if hydrophobic or hydrophilic or mixed) indicates that polarity is the key factor for the high mobility of confined water."}{"Thermal emissivity of silicon heterojunction solar cells ": "The aim of this work is to evaluate whether silicon heterojunction solar cells, lacking highly emissive, heavily doped silicon layers, could be better candidates for hybrid photovoltaic thermal collectors than standard aluminium-diffused back contact solar cells. To this end, the near and mid infrared emissivity of full silicon heterojunction solar cells, as well as of its constituent materials \u2013 crystalline silicon wafer, indium tin oxide, n-, i- and p-type amorphous silicon \u2013 have been assessed by means of ellipsometry and FTIR. The experimental results show that the thermal emissivity of these cells is actually as high as in the more traditional structures, ~80% at 8\u202f\u03bcm. Detailed optical modelling combining raytracing and transfer matrix formalism shows that the emissivity in these cells originates in the transparent conductive oxide layers themselves, where the doping is not high enough to result in a reflection that exceeds the increased free carrier absorption. Further modelling suggests that it is possible to obtain lower emissivity solar cells, but that a careful optimization of the transparent conductive layer needs to be done to avoid hindering the photovoltaic performance."}{"Highly efficient and stable planar CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cell with a new sensitive-dopant-free hole transport layer obtained via an effective surface passivation ": "Hole transport layers (HTLs) plays critical role in CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, few studies have been done to develop new and sensitive-dopant-free HTL for CsPbI2Br PSCs. Here, a low-cost fluorinated N',N',N'',N''-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)spiro[fluorene-9,9'-xanthene]-2,7-diamine (2mF-X59) was synthesized and applied as sensitive-dopant-free HTL into CsPbI2Br PSCs. After modified the 2mF-X59 and CsPbI2Br surface by 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquino-dimethane (F4-TCNQ), a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.42% was obtained for CsPbI2Br PSC with an impressive open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.23\u202fV, which is higher than that of the most previously reported CsPbI2Br PSCs with the doped Spiro-OMeTAD. More importantly, the CsPbI2Br PSCs with the newly developed HTLs showed remarkable stability retaining more than 94% of their initial PCE value after aging in air for 30 days without encapsulation. Therefore, we firmly believe that our new 2mF-X59 HTL created via molecular engineering is a promising candidate for preparing high performance CsPbI2Br PSCs."}{"The electrical properties of high performance multicrystalline silicon and mono-like silicon: Material limitations and cell potential ": "We compare the electrical properties of p-type and n-type industrially grown High Performance (HP) multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) and mono-like silicon. The materials are characterised in terms of their bulk lifetimes, their implied open circuit voltages, and the density and recombination velocity of recombination active grain boundaries and dislocation clusters within the materials. Quokka3 is applied to simulate the cell performance potential of the studied materials, and quantify the corresponding efficiency loss due to different recombination mechanisms occurring in the bulk. Our results show that bulk recombination causes a noticeable efficiency loss in high efficiency cast-grown silicon solar cells, varying from 0.1% to 3.1% absolute in the simulated devices, depending on the materials and also the ingot position of the wafers. The performance of p-type HP mc-Si is affected by both recombination at extended crystal defects and in the intra-grain regions. N-type HP mc-Si shows a slight advantage over p-type HP mc-Si in the intra-grain regions. The advantage of p-type mono-like Si over p-type mc-Si mainly comes from optical gains due to alkaline texturing, but the material exhibits large performance variations along the ingot of up to 2.4% absolute. N-type mono-like Si shows the most promising material properties, featuring less performance variation along the ingot than p-type mono-like Si, and the highest efficiency potential among the four studied materials."}{"Comparison of the energy saving potential of adaptive and controllable smart windows: A state-of-the-art review and simulation studies of thermochromic, photochromic and electrochromic technologies ": "Windows play a huge role in today's buildings, allowing for outside view and providing occupants with daylight. However, windows are also often considered to be one of the weakest building components with respect to high thermal losses and are in addition often the reason for overheating and glare issues. In comparison to traditional static windows, dynamic solutions like adaptive and controllable smart windows have the ability to adjust their optical properties in response to changing boundary conditions and hence have the potential to improve the energy performance and the user comfort of buildings. The objective of this work is twofold: (1) To collect and present the state-of-the-art of commercially available smart windows from manufacturers, both adaptive and controllable products, i.e. thermochromic, photochromic and electrochromic smart windows. This collection provides the reader with valuable information about window properties such as the U-value, g-value, solar transmittance (Tsol) and visible solar transmittance (Tvis). However, it is currently difficult to obtain all the desired information about the products from the manufacturers' websites and other open channels. (2) To conduct building energy performance simulations on selected products from each technology. These products are also simulated using the same U-values as the reference window, and in addition, two theoretical cases have been simulated to investigate the theoretical potential of different smart windows. Here, the optical parameters take on fictitious values between 10 and 90% and between 0 and 100% transmittance, respectively. All cases are simulated at three different locations, i.e. Trondheim (Norway), Madrid (Spain) and Nairobi (Kenya), and are compared to a reference static window. In total, 63 cases are simulated using the simulation software package IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE). The results shows that the electrochromic window controlled by operative temperature has the highest potential in lowering the energy demand for all cases and locations. The study also highlights the importance of having the right control strategy and control levels for each specific case."}{"Applications of cascaded phase change materials in solar water collector storage tanks: A review ": "Thermal energy storage plays a vital role to solve the problems related to the intermittent nature of solar energy. Phase change materials (PCMs) have shown promising applications in different thermal energy storage systems. Cascaded Thermal Storage (CTS) PCMs (multiple PCMs in a descending order of their melting temperatures), added new advantages to the applications of PCMs in thermal energy storage systems. Solar water collectors (SWCs) that utilize PCMs have been used to achieve economic and environmental benefits via substituting large-scale demand of energy. This literature review focuses on the different developments of PCMs and CTSPCMs and their implementation in SWC storage tanks. The novel and most recent developments of PCMs and CTSPCMs utilized in solar storage tanks with SWCs, such as, multi-storage tank with cascaded PCM, packed bed storage units, different configurations of heat exchanger storage units, and other innovative storage tank designs, are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, the existing studies that evaluated the PCM heat transfer improvement, thermal storage performance, thermodynamic optimization, and applications of cascaded thermal storage systems are also reviewed. The reviewed results in this work showed that the CTSPCM system can promote a significant improvement in the PCM heat transfer and stored rates of entransy, energy, and exergy, as well as lead to an increased storage energy and exergy efficiencies compared to the single stage PCM system. It is also revealed that: the multi-tank integrated with cascaded PCMs system is the best amongst the studied PCM storage tank systems within SWCs, for augmenting the storage capacity and improving the overall thermal efficiency of the water heating system. A noteworthy observations, important proportionalities, and future trends are also discussed for each technique."}{"Performance assessment of two-dimensional hydraulic models for generation of flood inundation maps in mountain river basins ": "Hydraulic models for the generation of flood inundation maps are not commonly applied in mountain river basins because of the difficulty in modeling the hydraulic behavior and the complex topography. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of four two-dimensional hydraulic models (HEC-RAS 2D, Iber 2D, Flood Modeller 2D, and PCSWMM 2D) with respect to the generation of flood inundation maps. The study area covers a 5-km reach of the Santa B\u00e1rbara River located in the Ecuadorian Andes, at 2330 masl, in Gualaceo. The model's performance was evaluated based on the water surface elevation and flood extent, in terms of the mean absolute difference and measure of fit. The analysis revealed that, for a given case, Iber 2D has the best performance in simulating the water level and inundation for flood events with 20- and 50-year return periods, respectively, followed by Flood Modeller 2D, HEC-RAS 2D, and PCSWMM 2D in terms of their performance. Grid resolution, the way in which hydraulic structures are mimicked, the model code, and the default value of the parameters are considered the main sources of prediction uncertainty."}{"Correlations between silt density index, turbidity and oxidation-reduction potential parameters in seawater reverse osmosis desalination ": "The reverse osmosis method is one of the most widely used methods of seawater desalination at present. Hydrophilic and desalting membranes in reverse osmosis systems are highly susceptible to the input pollutants. Various contaminants, including suspended organic and inorganic matter, result in membrane fouling and membrane degradation. Fundamental parameters such as the turbidity, the amount of chlorine injection, and silt density index (SDI) are the most predominant parameters of fouling control in the membranes. In this study, the operation system included a water intake unit, a pretreatment system, and an RO system. The pretreatment system encompassed a clarifier, a gravity sand filter, pressurized sand filters, and a cartridge filter. The correlation between the amount of chlorine injection in terms of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and the SDI value of the input water was investigated at a specified site next to the Persian Gulf. The results showed that, at certain intervals of inlet turbidity, injection of a certain amount of chlorine into the raw water has a distinct effect on the decrease of SDI."}{"Evaluation of copper removal efficiency using water treatment sludge ": "Large quantities of sludge are produced during water treatment processes. Recently, sludge has been treated as waste and disposed of in landfills, which increases the environmental burdens and the operational cost. Therefore, sludge reuse has become a significant environmental issue. In this study, adsorption of copper ions (Cu2+) onto calcined sludge was investigated under various operational conditions (with varying temperature, Cu2+ initial concentration, pH, and sludge dosage). The prepared sludge material was characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. The sorption capacity of sludge was directly proportional to the initial Cu2+ concentration and inversely proportional to the sludge dosage. The optimum operational pH and solution temperature were 6.6 and 80\u00b0C, respectively. The experimental results followed a Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-first-order adsorption kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters such as activation energy, change in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy were calculated. Thermodynamic analyses indicated that the sorption of copper ions onto the calcined sludge was driven by a physical adsorption process. The prepared sludge was proven to be an excellent adsorbent material for the removal of Cu2+ from an aqueous solution under optimum conditions."}{"Using multi-satellite microwave remote sensing observations for retrieval of daily surface soil moisture across China ": "The objective of this study was to retrieve daily composite soil moisture by jointly using brightness temperature observations from multiple operating satellites for near real-time application with better coverage and higher accuracy. Our approach was to first apply the single-channel brightness radiometric algorithm to estimate soil moisture from the respective brightness temperature observations of the SMAP, SMOS, AMSR2, FY3B, and FY3C satellites on the same day and then produce a daily composite dataset by averaging the individual satellite-retrieved soil moisture. We further evaluated our product, the official soil moisture products of the five satellites, and the ensemble mean (i.e., arithmetic mean) of the five official satellite soil moisture products against ground observations from two networks in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, China. The results show that our product outperforms the individual released products of the five satellites and their ensemble means in the two validation areas. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of our product were 0.06 and 0.09\u00a0m3/m3 in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. Relative to the ensemble mean of the five satellite products, our product improves the accuracy by 9.1% and 57.7% in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. This demonstrates that jointly using brightness temperature observations from multiple satellites to retrieve soil moisture not only improves the spatial coverage of daily observations but also produces better daily composite products."}{"River bank protection from ship-induced waves and river flow ": "A new equation is proposed for the design of armor units on protected river banks under the combined action of ship-induced waves and river flow. Existing observed field and experimental data in the literature have been examined and a valuable database has been developed. Different conditions, including the river water depth, flow velocity, river bank slope, Froude number, wave height, wave period, and wave obliquity have been considered. Results from an empirical equation (Bhowmik, 1978) that only considers the maximum wave height and river bank slope have been compared with the results calculated by the newly developed equation. Calculated results have also been verified against field data. Results show that not only the maximum wave height and river bank slope but also the water depth, flow velocity, wave length, wave obliquity, and wave period are important parameters for predicting the mean diameter of the armor units, highlighting the multivariate behavior of protecting the river bank in the presence of ship-induced waves and river flow velocity."}{"Impacts of rainfall and catchment characteristics on bioretention cell performance ": "Although many studies have evaluated the impacts of bioretention cell (BRC) design elements on hydrologic performance, few have investigated the roles played by site characteristics and rainfall patterns. The objectives of this study were to assess the impacts of rainfall and catchments with different characteristics on the hydrologic performance of BRCs and identify important factors in sizing bioretention when hydrologic performance was oriented for the design using a modeling approach. A 10-year record of rainfall data was used to identify the frequency and magnitude of rainfall events. The results showed that although the small and medium rainfall events were dominant they contributed less to the total rainfall depth than the large rainfall events. The ratio of runoff coefficient to imperviousness can be used as an indicator to explain why BRCs perform differently with the same design strategy under the same rainfall events. Rainfall patterns had significant impacts on the hydrologic performance of BRCs by influencing the overflow and underdrain flow. BRCs performed better for rainfall events with a longer duration and lower rainfall intensity because they generated smoother runoff processes into the BRCs. On the basis of these results, the runoff coefficient is suggested for BRC surface design."}{"Submerged flexible vegetation impact on open channel flow velocity distribution: An analytical modelling study on drag and friction ": "In this paper, an analytical model that represents the streamwise velocity distribution for open channel flow with submerged flexible vegetation is studied. In the present vegetated flow modelling, the whole flow field has been separated into two layers vertically: a vegetated layer and a non-vegetated free-water layer. Within the vegetated layer, an analysis of the mechanisms affecting water flow through flexible vegetation has been conducted. In the non-vegetated layer, a modified log-law equation that represents the velocity profile varying with vegetation height has been investigated.

Gabion structures offer one means of flood mitigation in dam spillways. These types of structures provide an additional challenge to the computational modeller in that flow through the porous gabions must be simulated. We have used a computational model to investigate the flow over gabion stepped spillways. The model was first validated against published experimental results. Then, gabion stepped spillways with four different step geometries were tested under the same conditions in order to facilitate inter-comparisons and to choose the best option in terms of energy dissipation. The results show that normal gabion steps can dissipate more energy than overlap, inclined, and pooled steps. An intensive set of tests with varying slope, stone size, and porosity were undertaken. The location of the inception point and the water depth at this point obtained from this study were compared with those from existing formulae. Two new empirical equations have been derived, on the basis of a regression analysis, to provide improved results for gabion stepped spillways."}{"Biosorption of Ni(II) ions from aqueous solution using modified Aloe barbadensis Miller leaf powder ": "This study aimed to investigate the biosorption potential of Na2CO3-modified Aloe barbadensis Miller (Aloe vera) leaf (MABL) powder for removal of Ni(II) ions from a synthetic aqueous solution. Effects of various process parameters (pH, equilibrium time, and temperature) were investigated in order to optimize the biosorptive removal. The maximum biosorption capacity of MABL was observed to be 28.986\u00a0mg/g at a temperature of 303\u00a0K, a biosorbent dose of 0.6\u00a0g, a contact time of 90\u00a0min, and a pH value of 7. Different kinetic models (the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models) were evaluated. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to be the best fitted model in this study, with a coefficient of determination of R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.974. Five different isotherm models (the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) models) were investigated to identify the best-suited isotherm model for the present system. Based on the minimum chi-square value (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a00.027) and the maximum coefficient of determination (R\n                     2\u00a0=\u00a00.996), the Langmuir isotherm model was found to represent the system well, indicating the possibility of monolayer biosorption. The sticking probability (S*) was found to be 0.41, suggesting a physisorption mechanism for biosorption of Ni(II) on MABL. The biosorbent was characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential, and BET surface area, in order to understand its morphological and functional characteristics."}{"Numerical simulation of flow separation over a backward-facing step with high Reynolds number ": "Large eddy simulation (LES) explicitly calculates the large-scale vortex field and parameterizes the small-scale vortices. In this study, LES and \u03ba-\u03b5 models were developed for a specific geometrical configuration of backward-facing step (BFS). The simulation results were validated with particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and direct numerical simulation (DNS). This LES simulation was carried out with a Reynolds number of 9000 in a pressurized water tunnel with an expansion ratio of 2.00. The results indicate that the LES model can reveal large-scale vortex motion although with a larger grid-cell size. However, the LES model tends to overestimate the top wall separation and the Reynolds stress components for the BFS flow simulation without a sufficiently fine grid. Overall, LES is a potential tool for simulating separated flow controlled by large-scale vortices."}{"Emotion Recognition from Physiological Signal Analysis: A Review ": "Human computer interaction is increasingly utilized in smart home, industry 4.0 and personal health. Communication between human and computer can benefit by a flawless exchange of emotions. As emotions have substantial influence on cognitive processes of the human brain such as learning, memory, perception and problem solving, emotional interactions benefit different applications. It can further be relevant in modern health care especially in interaction with patients suffering from stress or depression. Additionally rehabilitation applications, guiding patients through their rehabilitation training while adapting to the patients emotional state, would be highly motivating and might lead to a faster recovery. Depending on the application area, different systems for emotion recognition suit different purposes. The aim of this work is to give an overview of methods to recognize emotions and to compare their applicability based on existing studies. This review paper should enable practitioners, researchers and engineers to find a system most suitable for certain applications. An entirely contact-less method is to analyze facial features with the help of a video camera. This is useful when computers, smart-phones or tablets with integrated cameras are included in the task. Smart wearables provide contact with the skin and physiological parameters such as electro-dermal activity and heart related signals can be recorded unobtrusively also during dynamical tasks. Next to unimodal solutions, multimodal affective computing systems are analyzed since they promise higher classification accuracy. Accuracy varies based on the amount of detected emotions, extracted features, classification method and the quality of the database. Electroencephalography achieves 88.86 % accuracy for four emotions, multimodal measurements (Electrocardiography, Electromyography and bio-signals) 79.3 % for four emotive states, facial recognition 89 % for seven states and speech recognition 80.46 % for happiness and sadness. Looking forward, heart-related parameters might be an option to measure emotions accurately and unobtrusive with the help of smart wearables. This can be used in dynamic or outdoor tasks. Facial recognition on the other hand is a useful contact-less tool when it comes to emotion recognition during computer interaction."}{"Dialogue Systems for Intelligent Human Computer Interactions ": "The most fundamental communication mechanism for interaction is dialogues involving speech, gesture, semantic and pragmatic knowledge.

Furthermore, a new image-based method is used in Facebook bAbI Task 1 dataset in Out Of Vocabulary setting. The results show that using dialogue as an image performs well and helps dialogue manager in expanding out of vocabulary dialogue tasks in comparison to Memory Networks."}{"An Augmented Reality Prototype for supporting IoT-based Educational Activities for Energy-efficient School Buildings ": "The use of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies is currently being investigated in numerous and diverse application domains.

Experiences from a short summer trial ": "IoT sensors for measuring various sea water parameters, are explored here, aiming towards an educational context, in order to lead to a deeper understanding of the use of aquatic environments as natural resources, and towards the adoption of environmentally friendly behaviors. Sea-water sensing via IoT has not been extensively explored, due to practical difficulties in deployment, and the same applies to devising appropriate scenaria for understanding aquatic parameters in STEM education. A short hands-on IoT sensing trial, that has been conducted in various location of the Aegean sea, is reported in this paper. This research set out to gain insight into real data sets on which to base observations for devising realistic educational scenaria pertaining aquatic parameters. The results of this experiment are meant to guide research further, by shedding light into the IoT sensing issues that are involved in an educational scientific context. The goal is conducting broader research in the area of IoT water sensing towards its further utilization in STEM education."}{"Detecting Lung Abnormalities From X-rays Using an Improved SSL Algorithm ": "A significant component in computer-aided medical diagnosis is the automatic detection of lung abnormalities from digital chest X-rays; thus it constitutes a vital first step in radiologic image analysis. During the last decades, the rapid advances of digital technology and chest radiography have ultimately led to the development of large repositories with labeled and unlabeled images. Semi-supervised learning algorithms have become a hot topic of research, exploiting the explicit classification information of labeled images with the knowledge hidden in the unlabeled images. In the present work, we propose a new semi-supervised learning algorithm for the classification of lung abnormalities from X-rays based on an ensemble philosophy. The efficacy of the presented algorithm is demonstrated by numerical experiments, illustrating that reliable prediction models could be developed by incorporating ensemble methodologies in the semi-supervised framework."}{"Parametric Facial Animation for Affective Interaction Workflow for Avatar Retargeting ": "Virtual avatars/characters are essential in the interaction with virtual environments and 3D video games. While these avatars can be controlled by a bot or a human, they need a suitable model that allows emotion representation regardless of what or who is controlling them, since it increases the interaction and immersion. Provide facial expressions to any avatar require an animation process to emulate a particular gesture or emotion before to include it in a virtual environment. This process is specific to every single facial expression required in the avatar. This paper presents an initial approximation to contribute to the solve this problem with a workflow to apply a well-known parameterized face model called Candide. The proposal aims to adapt Candide into any avatar previously modeled through automatic morphological adjustment and texture mapping. This work includes the application of this workflow into six characters licensed under the Creative Commons copyright. We also present examples of facial emotion animation, as well as subjective assessment by five experts in audiovisual and animation production."}
