{"An improved prediction of residual stresses and distortion in additive manufacturing ": "In laser assisted additive manufacturing (AM) an accurate estimation of residual stresses and distortion is necessary to achieve dimensional accuracy and prevent premature fatigue failure, delamination and buckling of components. Since many process variables affect AM, experimental measurements of residual stresses and distortion are time consuming and expensive. Numerical thermo-mechanical models can be used for their estimation, but the quality of calculations depends critically on the accurate transient temperature field which affects both the residual stresses and distortion. In this study, a well-tested, three-dimensional, transient heat transfer and fluid flow model is used to accurately calculate transient temperature field for the residual stress and distortion modeling. The calculated residual stress distributions are compared with independent experimental results. It is shown that the residual stresses can be significantly minimized by reducing the layer thickness during AM. Inconel 718 components are found to be more susceptible to delamination than Ti-6Al-4V parts because they encounter higher residual stresses compared to their yield strength."}{"An efficient ab-initio quasiharmonic approach for the thermodynamics of solids ": "A first-principles approach called the self-consistent quasiharmonic approximation (SC-QHA) method is formulated to calculate the thermal expansion, thermomechanics, and thermodynamic functions of solids at finite temperatures with both high efficiency and accuracy. The SC-QHA method requires fewer phonon calculations than the conventional QHA method, and also facilitates the convenient analysis of the microscopic origins of macroscopic thermal phenomena. The superior performance of the SC-QHA method is systematically examined by comparing it with the conventional QHA method and experimental measurements on silicon, diamond, and alumina. It is then used to study the effects of pressure on the anharmonic lattice properties of diamond and alumina. The thermal expansion and thermomechanics of Ca3Ti2O7, which is a recently discovered important ferroelectric ceramic with a complex crystal structure that is computationally challenging for the conventional QHA method, are also calculated using the formulated SC-QHA method. The SC-QHA method can significantly reduce the computational expense for various quasiharmonic thermal properties especially when there are a large number of structures to consider or when the solid is structurally complex. It is anticipated that the algorithm will be useful for a variety of fields, including oxidation, corrosion, high-pressure physics, ferroelectrics, and high-throughput structure screening when temperature effects are required to accurately describe realistic properties."}{"Band structure diagram paths based on crystallography ": "Systematic and automatic calculations of the electronic band structure are a crucial component of computationally-driven high-throughput materials screening. An algorithm, for any crystal, to derive a unique description of the crystal structure together with a recommended band path is indispensable for this task. The electronic band structure is typically sampled along a path within the first Brillouin zone including the surface in reciprocal space. Some points in reciprocal space have higher site symmetries and/or have higher constraints than other points regarding the electronic band structure and therefore are likely to be more important than other points. This work categorizes points in reciprocal space according to their symmetry and provides recommended band paths that cover all special wavevector (\n                        \n                           k\n                        \n                     -vector) points and lines necessarily and sufficiently. Points in reciprocal space are labeled such that there is no conflict with the crystallographic convention. The \n                        \n                           k\n                        \n                     -vector coefficients of labeled points, which are located at Brillouin zone face and edge centers as well as vertices, are derived based on a primitive cell compatible with the crystallographic convention, including those with axial ratio-dependent coordinates. Furthermore, we provide an open-source implementation of the algorithms within our SeeK-path python code, to allow researchers to obtain \n                        \n                           k\n                        \n                     -vector coefficients and recommended band paths in an automated fashion. Finally, we created a free online service to compute and visualize the first Brillouin zone, labeled \n                        \n                           k\n                        \n                     -points and suggested band paths for any crystal structure, that we made available at http://www.materialscloud.org/tools/seekpath/."}{"Frontiers of 3D Printing/Additive Manufacturing: from Human Organs to Aircraft Fabrication\n                  \u2020\n               \n             ": "It has been more than three decades since stereolithography began to emerge in various forms of additive manufacturing and 3D printing.

Fast laser scans are responsible for severe thermal gradients and high cooling rates which produce complex hydrodynamic fluid flow. These phenomena affect crystal growth and orientation and are believed to be the cause of material spattering and microstructural defects, e.g. pores and incompletely melted particles. In this work, the microstructure and texture of 316L bars built along two different orientations and the effect of different distribution of defects on their mechanical response and failure mechanisms were investigated. Partially molten powder particles are believed to be responsible for the scattering in elongation to failure, reduced strength, and premature failure of vertical samples."}{"Ferrite nanoparticles: Synthesis, characterisation and applications in electronic device ": "Ferrite nanoparticles (FNPs) have attracted a great interest due to their wide applications in several areas such as biomedical, wastewater treatment, catalyst and electronic device.

Today, tape casting is the basic fabrication process that provides multilayered capacitors and multilayered ceramic packages. In tape casting the rheological behaviour of the slurry as well as the material flow during casting are of utmost importance since these phenomena to a large extent determine the final properties and hence the quality of the cast product. During the last decades this has led to an increasing number of works in literature within fluid flow analysis of tape casting. In the present paper a review of the development of the tape casting process with particular focus on the rheological classifications as well as modelling the material flow is hence presented and in this context the current status is examined and future potential discussed."}{"Effect of heat treatment on AlSi10Mg alloy fabricated by selective laser melting: Microstructure evolution, mechanical properties and fracture mechanism ": "The present paper systematically investigated the influence of solution and artificial aging heat treatments on the microstructures and mechanical properties of SLM-produced AlSi10Mg alloy parts. Due to the high cooling rate of SLM, an ultrafine eutectic microstructure in the as-built samples is characterized by spherical nano-sized network eutectic Si embedded in the Al matrix, which gives rise to significantly better tensile properties and Vickers micro-hardness. The solubility of Si atom in the Al matrix of as-built SLM samples is calculated to be 8.89at%. With the increase in the solution temperature, the solubility decreases rapidly. The artificial aging causes the further decrease of the solubility of Si atoms in the Al matrix. Upon solution heat treatment, Si atoms are rejected from the supersaturated Al matrix to form small Si particles. With increasing the solution temperature, the size of the Si particles increases, whereas their number decreases. After artificial aging, the Si particles are further coarsened. The variation in size of Si particles has a significant influence on the mechanical properties of the AlSi10Mg samples. The tensile strength decreases from 434.25\u00b110.7MPa for the as-built samples to 168.11\u00b12.4MPa, while the fracture strain remarkably increases from 5.3\u00b10.22% to 23.7\u00b10.84% when the as-built sample is solution-treated at 550\u00b0C for 2h. This study indicates that the microstructure and mechanical properties of SLM-processed AlSi10Mg alloy can be tailored by suitable solution and artificial aging heat treatments."}{"Mechanical properties of PNIPAM based hydrogels: A review ": "Materials which adjust their properties in response to environmental factors such as temperature, pH and ionic strength are rapidly evolving and known as smart materials. Hydrogels formed by smart polymers have various applications. Among the smart polymers, thermoresponsive polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)(PNIPAM) is very important because of its well defined structure and property specially its temperature response is closed to human body and can be finetuned as well. Mechanical properties are critical for the performance of stimuli responsive hydrogels in diverse applications. However, native PNIPAM hydrogels are very fragile and hardly useful for any practical purpose. Intense researches have been done in recent decade to enhance the mechanical features of PNIPAM hydrogel.

It has been demonstrated that microneedle arrays can increase the number of compounds amenable to transdermal delivery by penetrating the skin's protective barrier, the stratum corneum, and creating a pathway for drug permeation to the dermal tissue below. Microneedles have been extensively investigated in recent decades for drug and vaccine delivery as well as minimally invasive patient monitoring/diagnosis. This review focuses on a range of critically important aspects of microneedle technology, namely their material composition, manufacturing techniques, methods of evaluation and commercial translation to the clinic for patient benefit and economic return. Microneedle research and development is finally now at the stage where commercialisation is a realistic possibility. However, progress is still required in the areas of scaled-up manufacture and regulatory approval."}{"Atomistic calculations and materials informatics: A review ": "In recent years, there has been a large effort in the materials science community to employ materials informatics to accelerate materials discovery or to develop new understanding of materials behavior. Materials informatics methods utilize machine learning techniques to extract new knowledge or predictive models out of existing materials data. In this review, we discuss major advances in the intersection between data science and atom-scale calculations with a particular focus on studies of solid-state, inorganic materials. The examples discussed in this review cover methods for accelerating the calculation of computationally-expensive properties, identifying promising regions for materials discovery based on existing data, and extracting chemical intuition automatically from datasets.

Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies including direct energy deposition (DED), selective laser melting (SLM), electron beam melting (EBM) and binder jet 3D printing (BJ3DP) can minimize scrap generation and reduce lead times. While there is extensive literature on the use of melting and solidification based AM technologies, there has been limited research on the use of binder jet 3D printing. In this paper, a brief review on binder jet additive manufacturing of Inconel 718 is presented. In addition, existing knowledge on sintering of Inconel 718 has been extended to binder jet 3D printing. We found that supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS) is necessary to achieve full densification of Inconel 718. SLPS is sensitive to the feedstock chemistry that has a strong influence on the liquid volume fraction at the processing temperature. Based on these results, we discuss an empirical framework to determine the role of powder particle size and liquid volume fraction on sintering kinetics. The role of powder packing factor and binder saturation on microstructural evolution is discussed. The current challenges in the use of BJ3DP for fabrication of Inconel 718, as well as, extension to other metal systems, are presented."}{"Structural effects on the magnetic hyperthermia properties of iron oxide nanoparticles ": "Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are heavily explored as diagnostic and therapeutic agents due to their low cost, tunable properties, and biocompatibility.

In this review, we focus on how structural changes and inter-particle interactions affect the heating efficiency of iron oxide-based magnetic NPs. Moreover, we present an overview of the different approaches to evaluate the heating performance of IONPs and introduce a new theranostic modality based on magnetic imaging guided\u2013hyperthermia."}{"Tutorial: Crystal orientations and EBSD \u2014 Or which way is up? ": "Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is an automated technique that can measure the orientation of crystals in a sample very rapidly. There are many sophisticated software packages that present measured data. Unfortunately, due to crystal symmetry and differences in the set-up of microscope and EBSD software, there may be accuracy issues when linking the crystal orientation to a particular microstructural feature. In this paper we outline a series of conventions used to describe crystal orientations and coordinate systems. These conventions have been used to successfully demonstrate that a consistent frame of reference is used in the sample, unit cell, pole figure and diffraction pattern frames of reference. We establish a coordinate system rooted in measurement of the diffraction pattern and subsequently link this to all other coordinate systems. A fundamental outcome of this analysis is to note that the beamshift coordinate system needs to be precisely defined for consistent 3D microstructure analysis. This is supported through a series of case studies examining particular features of the microscope settings and/or unambiguous crystallographic features. These case studies can be generated easily in most laboratories and represent an opportunity to demonstrate confidence in use of recorded orientation data. Finally, we include a simple software tool, written in both MATLAB\u00ae and Python, which the reader can use to compare consistency with their own microscope set-up and which may act as a springboard for further offline analysis."}{"The effectiveness of combining rolling deformation with Wire\u2013Arc Additive Manufacture on \u03b2-grain refinement and texture modification in Ti\u20136Al\u20134V ": "In Additive Manufacture (AM), with the widely used titanium alloy Ti\u20136Al\u20134V, the solidification conditions typically result in undesirable, coarse-columnar, primary \u03b2 grain structures. This can result in a strong texture and mechanical anisotropy in AM components. Here, we have investigated the efficacy of a new approach to promote \u03b2 grain refinement in Wire\u2013Arc Additive Manufacture (WAAM) of large scale parts, which combines a rolling step sequentially with layer deposition. It has been found that when applied in-process, to each added layer, only a surprisingly low level of deformation is required to greatly reduce the \u03b2 grain size. From EBSD analysis of the rolling strain distribution in each layer and reconstruction of the prior \u03b2 grain structure, it has been demonstrated that the normally coarse centimetre scale columnar \u03b2 grain structure could be refined down to <100\u03bcm. Moreover, in the process both the \u03b2 and \u03b1 phase textures were substantially weakened to close to random. It is postulated that the deformation step causes new \u03b2 orientations to develop, through local heterogeneities in the deformation structure, which act as nuclei during the \u03b1\u2192\u03b2 transformation that occurs as each layer is re-heated by the subsequent deposition pass."}{"COMBO: An efficient Bayesian optimization library for materials science ": "In many subfields of chemistry and physics, numerous attempts have been made to accelerate scientific discovery using data-driven experimental design algorithms.

The CA model\u2019s capture rule was modified by a limited neighbor solid fraction (LNSF) method. Various interface curvature calculation methods have been compared. A modified curvature calculation method based on the variation of the unit vector normal (VUVN) to the solid-liquid interface using volume of fluid (VOF) interpolation technique gets better results.

Conducting polymers symbolize a paramount class of organic materials that boost the resistivity towards external stimuli. Nevertheless, PANI-based sensor experiences some disadvantages of relatively low reproducibility, selectivity, and stability.

The mechanical testing shows that the yield strength, ductility and toughness are well above the acceptance criteria and only the ultimate tensile strength of EBM\u00ae SS316L is below the RCC-MR code. Microstructure characterizations reveal the presence of hierarchical structures consisting of solidified melt pools, columnar grains and irregular shaped sub-grains. Lots of precipitates enriched in Cr and Mo are observed at columnar grain boundaries while no sign of element segregation is shown at the sub-grain boundaries. Such a unique microstructure forms during a non-equilibrium process, comprising rapid solidification and a gradient \u2018annealing\u2019 process due to anisotropic thermal flow of accumulated heat inside the powder granule matrix. Relations between process parameters, specimen geometry (total building time) and sub-grain structure are discussed. Defects are formed mainly due to the large layer thickness (100 \n                        \n                           \u03bc\n                           m\n                           )\n                        \n                      which generates insufficient bonding between a few of the adjacently formed melt pools during the process. Further studies should focus on adjusting layer thickness to improve the strength of EBM\u00ae SS316L and optimizing total building time."}{"Zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) rhombic dodecahedrons as full-spectrum light harvesting photocatalyst for environmental remediation ": "The inferior utilization efficiency of light is the main obstacle to the practical application of traditional photocatalysts such as TiO2 and ZnO. In this regard, the development of novel photocatalysts with the capability of harvesting full spectrum light (from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR)) energy is a promising solution for solar energy conversion and environmental remediation. Here, we report the discovery of a single material that can harvest UV, visible (VIS), and NIR radiations to decompose heavy metal contaminants in aqueous solution. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) rhombic dodecahedrons were synthesized through a facile solution approach and employed in the reduction of Cr(VI) under UV\u2212VIS\u2212NIR pulsed laser irradiation, which was generated from the fundamental, second and third harmonics of Nd:YAG laser, respectively. The nanostructures showed efficient Cr(VI) reduction under UV, VIS and NIR laser irradiation and the measured reduction efficiency (%) was 71.22%, 69.52%, and 40.79%, respectively after 120\u00a0min. A possible explanation for the photocatalytic activity in Cr(VI) reduction was proposed. This is the first study of its kind where pulsed laser and ZIF-67 rhombic dodecahedrons capable of harvesting full spectrum light energy have been employed for the removal of Cr(VI) from water. The extraordinary capacity of harvesting full-spectrum light and long-term stability make ZIF-67 a potential photocatalyst for environmental remediation."}{"Adsorption of formate species on Cu(h,k,l) low index surfaces ": "We report a density functional theory study on the relative stability of formate species on Cu(h,k,l) low index surfaces using a range of exchange-correlation functionals. We find that these functionals predict similar geometries for the formate molecule adsorbed on the Cu surface. A comparison of the calculated vibrational transition energies of a perpendicular configuration of formate on Cu surface shows an excellent agreement with the experimental spectrum obtained from inelastic neutron spectroscopy. From the calculations on adsorption energy we find that formate is most stable on the Cu(110) surface as compared to Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces. Bader analysis shows that this feature could be related to the higher charge transfer from the Cu(110) surface and optimum charge density at the interfacial region due to bidirectional electron transfer between the formate and the Cu surface. Analysis of the partial density of states finds that in the \u20135.5eV to \u20134.0eV region, hybridization between O p and the non-axial Cu d\n                     \n                        yz\n                      and d\n                     \n                        xz\n                      orbitals takes place on the Cu(110) surface, which is energetically more favourable than on the other surfaces."}{"CO-CO coupling on Cu facets: Coverage, strain and field effects ": "We present a DFT study on the effect of coverage, strain, and electric field on CO-CO coupling energetics on Cu (100), (111), and (211). Our calculations indicate that CO-CO coupling is facile on all three facets in the presence of a cation-induced electric field in the Helmholtz plane, with the lowest barrier on Cu(100). The CO dimerization pathway is therefore expected to play a role in C2 formation at potentials negative of the Cu potential of zero charge, corresponding to CO2/CO reduction conditions at high pH. Both increased *CO coverage and tensile strain further improve C-C coupling energetics on Cu (111) and (211). Since CO dimerization is facile on all 3 Cu facets, subsequent surface hydrogenation steps may also play an important role in determining the overall activity towards C2 products. Adsorption of *CO, *H, and *OH on the 3 facets were investigated with a Pourbaix analysis. The (211) facet has the largest propensity to co-adsorb *CO and *H, which would favor surface hydrogenation following CO dimerization."}{"Assessing the concept of structure sensitivity or insensitivity for sub-nanometer catalyst materials ": "The nature of the nano-catalyzed hydrogenation of ethylene, yielding benchmark information pertaining to the concept of structure sensitivity/insensitivity and its applicability at the bottom of the catalyst particle size-range, is explored with experiments on size-selected Ptn (n=7\u201340) clusters soft-landed on MgO, in conjunction with first-principles simulations. As in the case of larger particles both the direct ethylene hydrogenation channel and the parallel hydrogenation\u2013dehydrogenation ethylidyne-producing route must be considered, with the fundamental uncovering that at the <1nm size-scale the reaction exhibits characteristics consistent with structure sensitivity, in contrast to the structure insensitivity found for larger particles. In this size-regime, the chemical properties can be modulated and tuned by a single atom, reflected by the onset of low temperature hydrogenation at T>150K catalyzed by Ptn (n\u226510) clusters, with maximum room temperature reactivity observed for Pt13 using a pulsed molecular beam technique. Structure insensitive behavior, inherent for specific cluster sizes at ambient temperatures, can be induced in the more active sizes, e.g. Pt13, by a temperature increase, up to 400K, which opens dehydrogenation channels leading to ethylidyne formation. This reaction channel was, however found to be attenuated on Pt20, as catalyst activity remained elevated after the 400K step. Pt30 displayed behavior which can be understood from extrapolating bulk properties to this size range; in particular the calculated d-band center. In the non-scalable sub-nanometer size regime, however, precise control of particle size may be used for atom-by-atom tuning and manipulation of catalyzed hydrogenation activity and selectivity."}{"All solid-state polymer electrolytes for high-performance lithium ion batteries ": "All solid-state polymer electrolytes have been received a huge amount of attention in high-performance lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to their unique characteristics, such as no leakage, low flammability, excellent processability, good flexibility, wide electrochemical stability window, high safety and superior thermal stability. In this review, we summarized a series of all solid-state polymer electrolytes based on modified poly (ethylene oxide), polycarbonate, polysiloxane, succinonitrile and organic-inorganic hybrid composite. The recent progress on all solid-state polymer electrolytes has been reviewed in term of their potential application in LIBs. It is expected that the high-performance solid-state polymer electrolytes can be used in portable electrochemical devices, electric vehicles and grid energy storage."}{"Lifetime vs. rate capability: Understanding the role of FEC and VC in high-energy Li-ion batteries with nano-silicon anodes ": "Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and vinylene carbonate (VC) are the most frequently used electrolyte components to enhance the lifetime of anode materials in Li-ion batteries, but for silicon it is still ambiguous when FEC or VC is more beneficial. Herein, a nanostructured silicon/carbon anode derived from low-cost HSiCl3 is tailored by the rational choice of the electrolyte component, to obtain an anode material outperforming current complex silicon structures. We demonstrate highly reversible areal capacities of up to 5mAh/cm2 at 4.4mg/cm2 mass loading, a specific capacity of 1280mAh/gElectrode, a capacity retention of 81% after 500 deep-discharge cycles versus lithium metal and successful full-cell tests with high-voltage cathodes meeting the requirements for real application. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and post-mortem investigation provide new insights in tailoring the interfacial properties of silicon-based anodes for high performance anode materials based on an alloying mechanism with large volume changes. The role of fluorine in the FEC-derived interfacial layer is discussed in comparison with the VC-derived layer and possible degradation mechanisms are proposed. We believe that this study gives a valuable understanding and provides new strategies on the facile use of additives for highly reversible silicon anodes in Li-ion batteries."}{"Review of in-situ process monitoring and in-situ metrology for metal additive manufacturing ": "Lack of assurance of quality with additively manufactured (AM) parts is a key technological barrier that prevents manufacturers from adopting AM technologies, especially for high-value applications where component failure cannot be tolerated. Developments in process control have allowed significant enhancement of AM techniques and marked improvements in surface roughness and material properties, along with a reduction in inter-build variation and the occurrence of embedded material discontinuities. As a result, the exploitation of AM processes continues to accelerate. Unlike established subtractive processes, where in-process monitoring is now commonplace, factory-ready AM processes have not yet incorporated monitoring technologies that allow discontinuities to be detected in process. Researchers have investigated new forms of instrumentation and adaptive approaches which, when integrated, will allow further enhancement to the assurance that can be offered when producing AM components. The state-of-the-art with respect to inspection methodologies compatible with AM processes is explored here. Their suitability for the inspection and identification of typical material discontinuities and failure modes is discussed with the intention of identifying new avenues for research and proposing approaches to integration into future generations of AM systems."}{"Large-scale 3D printing of ultra-high performance concrete \u2013 a new processing route for architects and builders ": "In the present paper a new additive manufacturing processing route is introduced for ultra-high performance concrete. Interdisciplinary work involving materials science, computation, robotics, architecture and design resulted in the development of an innovative way of 3D printing cementitious materials. The 3D printing process involved is based on a FDM-like technique, in the sense that a material is deposited layer by layer through an extrusion printhead mounted on a 6-axis robotic arm. The mechanical properties of 3D printed materials are assessed. The proposed technology succeeds in solving many of the problems that can be found in the literature. Most notably, this process allows the production of 3D large-scale complex geometries, without the use of temporary supports, as opposed to 2.5D examples found in the literature for concrete 3D printing. Architectural cases of application are used as examples in order to demonstrate the potentialities of the technology. Two structural elements were produced and constitute some of the largest 3D printed concrete parts available until now. Multi-functionality was enabled for both structural elements by taking advantage of the complex geometry which can be achieved using our technology for large-scale additive manufacturing."}{"A review of dynamic recrystallization phenomena in metallic materials ": "The dynamic recrystallization (DRX) phenomena occurring in different thermo-mechanical processing (TMP) conditions for various metallic materials are reviewed. Several types of DRX are described: discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX), continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and geometric dynamic recrystallization (GDRX). The terminologies used in this field are summarized, together with the key factors influencing the DRX processes including stacking fault energy, initial grain size, TMP conditions and second-phase particles. Both standard and advanced experimental techniques used to characterize DRX processes are examined. The focus is placed on the mechanisms of these three types of DRX, and the related numerical models."}{"A review on g-C3N4-based photocatalysts ": "As one of the most appealing and attractive technologies, heterogeneous photocatalysis has been utilized to directly harvest, convert and store renewable solar energy for producing sustainable and green solar fuels and a broad range of environmental applications. Due to their unique physicochemical, optical and electrical properties, a wide variety of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have been designed to drive various reduction and oxidation reactions under light irradiation with suitable wavelengths. In this review, we have systematically summarized the photocatalytic fundamentals of g-C3N4\n                     -based photocatalysts, including fundamental mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis, advantages, challenges and the design considerations of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. The versatile properties of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are highlighted, including their crystal structural, surface phisicochemical, stability, optical, adsorption, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and electronic properties. Various design strategies are also thoroughly reviewed, including band-gap engineering, defect control, dimensionality tuning, pore texture tailoring, surface sensitization, heterojunction construction, co-catalyst and nanocarbon loading. Many important applications are also addressed, such as photocatalytic water splitting (H2 evolution and overall water splitting), degradation of pollutants, carbon dioxide reduction, selective organic transformations and disinfection. Through reviewing the important state-of-the-art advances on this topic, it may provide new opportunities for designing and constructing highly effective g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for various applications in photocatalysis and other related fields, such as solar cell, photoelectrocatalysis, electrocatalysis, lithium battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell and separation and purification."}{"Surface modification and enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of TiO2: a review ": "Recently, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels has caused high emissions of the greenhouse gases, CO2 into atmosphere and global energy crisis. Mimicking the natural photosynthesis by using semiconductor materials to achieve photocatalytic CO2 reduction into valuable solar fuels such as CH4, HCO2H, CH2O, and CH3OH is known as one of the best solutions for addressing the aforementioned issue. Among various proposed photocatalysts, TiO2 has been extensively studied over the past several decades for photocatalytic CO2 reduction because of its cheapness and environmental friendliness. Particularly, surface modification of TiO2 has attracted numerous interests due to its capability of enhancing the light absorption ability, facilitating the electron-hole separation, tuning the CO2 reduction selectivity and increasing the CO2 adsorption and activation ability of TiO2 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In this review, recent approaches of the surface modification of TiO2 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, including impurity doping, metal deposition, alkali modification, heterojunction construction and carbon-based material loading, are presented. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction mechanism and pathways of TiO2 are discussed. The future research direction and perspective of photocatalytic CO2 reduction over surface-modified TiO2 are also presented."}{"Laser textured superhydrophobic surfaces and their applications for homogeneous spot deposition ": "This work reports the laser surface modification of 304S15 stainless steel to develop superhydrophobic properties and the subsequent application for homogeneous spot deposition. Superhydrophobic surfaces, with steady contact angle of \u223c154\u00b0 and contact angle hysteresis of \u223c4\u00b0, are fabricated by direct laser texturing. In comparison with common pico-/femto-second lasers employed for this patterning, the nanosecond fiber laser used in this work is more cost-effective, compact and allows higher processing rates. The effect of laser power and scan line separation on surface wettability of textured surfaces are investigated and optimized fabrication parameters are given. Fluid flows and transportations of polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles suspension droplets on the processed surfaces and unprocessed wetting substrates are investigated. After evaporation is complete, the coffee-stain effect is observed on the untextured substrates but not on the superhydrophobic surfaces. Uniform deposition of PS particles on the laser textured surfaces is achieved and the deposited material is confined to smaller area."}{"Analysis of transferred fragrance and its forensic implications ": "Perfumes are widely used by many people in developed countries, and a large number of both men and women wear perfumes on a daily basis. Analysis of perfume trace materials from clothing is not commonly employed within forensic casework, yet as a form of trace evidence it has the potential to provide valuable intelligence. In order to appreciate the value of trace evidence there is a fundamental need for an evidence base that can both offer insight into how a trace material behaves under different scenarios and activities, and from which inferences can be made. With this purpose a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for trace analysis of perfumes was developed. This paper presents two different series of experiments that investigate the dynamics of perfume transfer as a factor of perfume ageing time, and as a factor of perfume contact time. Empirical data showed that both perfume ageing time, and perfume contact time play a key role in the number of perfume components transferred. These studies have implication for forensic protocols, specifically for perfume trace evidence collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation, and there is potentially great value in analysing perfumes from clothing exhibits in forensic enquiries that involve close contact between individuals, such as sexual assaults."}{"Thinking forensics: Cognitive science for forensic practitioners ": "Human factors and their implications for forensic science have attracted increasing levels of interest across criminal justice communities in recent years. Initial interest centred on cognitive biases, but has since expanded such that knowledge from psychology and cognitive science is slowly infiltrating forensic practices more broadly. This article highlights a series of important findings and insights of relevance to forensic practitioners. These include research on human perception, memory, context information, expertise, decision-making, communication, experience, verification, confidence, and feedback. The aim of this article is to sensitise forensic practitioners (and lawyers and judges) to a range of potentially significant issues, and encourage them to engage with research in these domains so that they may adapt procedures to improve performance, mitigate risks and reduce errors. Doing so will reduce the divide between forensic practitioners and research scientists as well as improve the value and utility of forensic science evidence."}{"Iron oxide surfaces ": "The current status of knowledge regarding the surfaces of the iron oxides, magnetite (Fe3O4), maghemite (\u03b3-Fe2O3), haematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3), and w\u00fcstite (Fe1\u2212x\n                     O) is reviewed. The paper starts with a summary of applications where iron oxide surfaces play a major role, including corrosion, catalysis, spintronics, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), biomedicine, photoelectrochemical water splitting and groundwater remediation. The bulk structure and properties are then briefly presented; each compound is based on a close-packed anion lattice, with a different distribution and oxidation state of the Fe cations in interstitial sites. The bulk defect chemistry is dominated by cation vacancies and interstitials (not oxygen vacancies) and this provides the context to understand iron oxide surfaces, which represent the front line in reduction and oxidation processes. Fe diffuses in and out from the bulk in response to the O2 chemical potential, forming sometimes complex intermediate phases at the surface. For example, \u03b1-Fe2O3 adopts Fe3O4-like surfaces in reducing conditions, and Fe3O4 adopts Fe1\u2212x\n                     O-like structures in further reducing conditions still. It is argued that known bulk defect structures are an excellent starting point in building models for iron oxide surfaces.\n                  The atomic-scale structure of the low-index surfaces of iron oxides is the major focus of this review. Fe3O4 is the most studied iron oxide in surface science, primarily because its stability range corresponds nicely to the ultra-high vacuum environment. It is also an electrical conductor, which makes it straightforward to study with the most commonly used surface science methods such as photoemission spectroscopies (XPS, UPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The impact of the surfaces on the measurement of bulk properties such as magnetism, the Verwey transition and the (predicted) half-metallicity is discussed.\n                  The best understood iron oxide surface at present is probably Fe3O4(100); the structure is known with a high degree of precision and the major defects and properties are well characterised. A major factor in this is that a termination at the Feoct\u2013O plane can be reproducibly prepared by a variety of methods, as long as the surface is annealed in 10\u22127\u221210\u22125\n                     mbar O2 in the final stage of preparation. Such straightforward preparation of a monophase termination is generally not the case for iron oxide surfaces. All available evidence suggests the oft-studied (\u221a2\u00d7\u221a2)R45\u00b0 reconstruction results from a rearrangement of the cation lattice in the outermost unit cell in which two octahedral cations are replaced by one tetrahedral interstitial, a motif conceptually similar to well-known Koch\u2013Cohen defects in Fe1\u2212x\n                     O. The cation deficiency results in Fe11O16 stoichiometry, which is in line with the chemical potential in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), which is close to the border between the Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 phases. The Fe3O4(111) surface is also much studied, but two different surface terminations exist close in energy and can coexist, which makes sample preparation and data interpretation somewhat tricky. Both the Fe3O4(100) and Fe3O4(111) surfaces exhibit Fe-rich terminations as the sample selvedge becomes reduced. The Fe3O4(110) surface forms a one-dimensional (1\u00d73) reconstruction linked to nanofaceting, which exposes the more stable Fe3O4(111) surface. \u03b1-Fe2O3(0001) is the most studied haematite surface, but difficulties preparing stoichiometric surfaces under UHV conditions have hampered a definitive determination of the structure. There is evidence for at least three terminations: a bulk-like termination at the oxygen plane, a termination with half of the cation layer, and a termination with ferryl groups. When the surface is reduced the so-called \u201cbi-phase\u201d structure is formed, which eventually transforms to a Fe3O4(111)-like termination. The structure of the bi-phase surface is controversial; a largely accepted model of coexisting Fe1\u2212x\n                     O and \u03b1-Fe2O3(0001) islands was recently challenged and a new structure based on a thin film of Fe3O4(111) on \u03b1-Fe2O3(0001) was proposed. The merits of the competing models are discussed. The \u03b1-Fe2O3(1\n                        \n                           \n                              1\n                           \n                           \u00af\n                        \n                     02) \u201cR-cut\u201d surface is recommended as an excellent prospect for future study given its apparent ease of preparation and its prevalence in nanomaterial.\n                  In the latter sections the literature regarding adsorption on iron oxides is reviewed. First, the adsorption of molecules (H2, H2O, CO, CO2, O2, HCOOH, CH3OH, CCl4, CH3I, C6H6, SO2, H2S, ethylbenzene, styrene, and Alq3) is discussed, and an attempt is made to relate this information to the reactions in which iron oxides are utilized as a catalyst (water\u2013gas shift, Fischer\u2013Tropsch, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene) or catalyst supports (CO oxidation). The known interactions of iron oxide surfaces with metals are described, and it is shown that the behaviour is determined by whether the metal forms a stable ternary phase with the iron oxide. Those that do not, (e.g. Au, Pt, Ag, Pd) prefer to form three-dimensional particles, while the remainder (Ni, Co, Mn, Cr, V, Cu, Ti, Zr, Sn, Li, K, Na, Ca, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca) incorporate within the oxide lattice. The incorporation temperature scales with the heat of formation of the most stable metal oxide. A particular effort is made to underline the mechanisms responsible for the extraordinary thermal stability of isolated metal adatoms on Fe3O4 surfaces, and the potential application of this model system to understand single atom catalysis and sub-nano cluster catalysis is discussed. The review ends with a brief summary, and a perspective is offered including exciting lines of future research."}{"Pharmaceutical salts: Theory, use in solid dosage forms and in situ preparation in an aerosol ": "In this article, the theoretical foundation for salts is given with an emphasis on the amount of drug in solution. Consideration is given for the solubility of the non-ionized form, acid dissociation constant and solubility product, which are the limiting constraints. For dissolution of nonionized drugs, the surface pH differs from the bulk pH, giving rise to a lower than expected rate. For salts, theoretical considerations are relatively complex, and an experimental approach to estimating the surface pH is more likely to be of value in predicting the dissolution rate. General guidelines are described for screening, preparing and characterizing drugs as salts, which critically depend on the goal of the product development. Thereafter, our work involving the preparation of salts as a means to generate aerosols from a solution is provided. The solubility of six structurally related compounds was determined in four acids. Thereafter, the amount of the compound in solution was determined as a function of pH, using the acid that provided the highest solubility. Because the pH required to achieve the needed concentration for aerosol generation was low, ammonia vapor was introduced into the air stream to neutralize aerosol droplets. Solvent was then removed from the aerosol by a silica column. The resulting aerosol had a concentration of 96\u2009\u00b5g/l and a mass median particle size of 1.8\u2009\u00b5m. The reported pharmacokinetic study substantiated the feasibility of evaluating its safety and efficacy of inhalation administration in the rat model."}{"Thin films as an emerging platform for drug delivery ": "Pharmaceutical scientists throughout the world are trying to explore thin films as a novel drug delivery tool. Thin films have been identified as an alternative approach to conventional dosage forms. The thin films are considered to be convenient to swallow, self-administrable, and fast dissolving dosage form, all of which make it as a versatile platform for drug delivery. This delivery system has been used for both systemic and local action via several routes such as oral, buccal, sublingual, ocular, and transdermal routes. The design of efficient thin films requires a comprehensive knowledge of the pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties of drugs and polymers along with an appropriate selection of manufacturing processes. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of the critical factors affecting the formulation of thin films, including the physico-chemical properties of polymers and drugs, anatomical and physiological constraints, as well as the characterization methods and quality specifications to circumvent the difficulties associated with formulation design. It also highlights the recent trends and perspectives to develop thin film products by various companies."}{"Application of quality by design in the current drug development ": "Quality by Test was the only way to guarantee quality of drug products before FDA launched current Good Manufacturing Practice.

The application of QbD in drug formulation and process design is based on a good understanding of the sources of variability and the manufacture process. In this paper, the basic knowledge of QbD, the elements of QbD, steps and tools for QbD implementation in pharmaceutics field, including risk assessment, design of experiment, and process analytical technology (PAT), are introduced briefly.

It is a widely employed approach to retain the dosage form in the stomach for an extended period of time and release the drug slowly that can address many challenges associated with conventional oral delivery, including poor bioavailability. Different innovative approaches like magnetic field assisted gastro-retention, plug type swelling system, muco-adhesion technique, floating system with or without effervescence are being applied to fabricate GRDDS. Apart from in vitro characterization, successful GRDDS development demands well designed in vivo study to establish enhanced gastro-retention and prolonged drug release. Gama scintigraphy and MRI are popular techniques to evaluate in vivo gastric residence time. However, checking of their overall in-vivo efficacy still remains a major challenge for this kind of dosage form, especially in small animals like mice or rat. Reported in vivo studies with beagle dogs, rabbits, and human subjects are only a handful in spite of a large number of encouraging in vitro results. In spite of the many advantages, high subject variations in gastrointestinal physiological condition, effect of food, and variable rate of gastric emptying time are the challenges that limit the number of available GRDDS in the market. This review article highlights the in vivo works of GRDDS carried out in the recent past, including their limitations and challenges that need to be overcome in the near future."}{"Extrusion\u2013spheronization a promising pelletization technique: In-depth review ": "This review article deals with various aspects of the extrusion\u2013spheronization technique.

Herein, a method to anchor reduced glutathione (GSH, i.e. an important antioxidant tripeptide in all living organisms) onto AuNP surface with preservation of the GSH thiol function was reported. Using AuNP capped with dihydrolipoic acid (AuNP@DHLA) as starting material, GSH was anchored by an N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-mediated coupling between the carboxylate group of DHLA and the amine function of GSH to generate AuNP@DHLA-(GSH)n. Yields of 7.5\u00b11.2\u03bcM of thiol per nM of AuNP were obtained. These particles showed a markedly enhanced reductive capacity compared to AuNP@DHLA and free GSH evaluated by two assays commonly used in evaluation of antioxidant activities, i.e. 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and Ferric ion Reducing Antioxidant Power assays, and by direct potentiometry."}{"Anthropometric measurements for ergonomic design of students\u2019 furniture in India ": "This paper presents anthropometric measurements regarding engineering students in India.

Also, it is highly recommended to consider requirements from students in designing classrooms furniture and conduct seminar or workshop to educate students regarding the negative impact towards adapting poor posture in the long usage of classrooms furniture."}{"Model design and simulation of automatic sorting machine using proximity sensor ": "The automatic sorting system has been reported to be complex and a global problem. This is because of the inability of sorting machines to incorporate flexibility in their design concept. This research therefore designed and developed an automated sorting object of a conveyor belt. The developed automated sorting machine is able to incorporate flexibility and separate species of non-ferrous metal objects and at the same time move objects automatically to the basket as defined by the regulation of the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) with a capacitive proximity sensor to detect a value range of objects. The result obtained shows that plastic, wood, and steel were sorted into their respective and correct position with an average, sorting, time of 9.903s, 14.072s and 18.648s respectively. The proposed developed model of this research could be adopted at any institution or industries, whose practices are based on mechatronics engineering systems. This is to guide the industrial sector in sorting of object and teaching aid to institutions and hence produce the list of classified materials according to the enabled sorting program commands."}{"Industrial occupational safety and health innovation for sustainable development ": "Sustainable development is not thought in a box without development pillars. Previous researchers put these pillars as economy, social and environment. Upon improving these three pillars, sustainable development becomes trustworthy in relation to workplace safety and health improvement. However, the researchers\u2019 findings have drawback in considering existing three pillars. Previous researches neglected to incorporate the other three pillars of sustainable development which are culture, political and technological factors. Having these pillars, sustainable development can also be guaranteed by considering workplace safety and health innovation for all internal and external entities engage at work. This is because of the implementation the pillars reduce the working environment accidents and disease. Hence, this research focuses on the workplace safety & health innovation, introducing new pillars for sustainable development, their impact on sustainable developments and indicating the three pillars future research areas. Methods like literature review, interviewing employees and observation of industries were used. There were few researches found on how sustainable development affected by workplace safety and health innovation approaches. However, this literature more focused on the relationship workplace innovation and sustainable development share in common. The other finding in this study showed that the innovation of workplace safety and health brings sustainable development through healthy people, safer workplace, reduced cost of accidents, controlled environment, managed workplace accidents and improved workplace safety knowledge. The researchers have also attempted to forward roads toward sustainable development through occupational safety and health innovation and improvement approaches."}{"Spintronics: A contemporary review of emerging electronics devices ": "Spintronics is a new field of research exploiting the influence of electron spin on the electrical conduction (or current is spin dependent). The major problem is the realization and fabrication of spintronics based devices. To meet the objective scientific community is developing the novel kind of materials that relies on magnetism instead of flow of current through electron. This paper illustrates and reviews one of the emerging technologies known as spintronics by putting few low power computing techniques altogether based on spintronics to provide a basic and meaningful understanding to the reader. The challenges of spintronics devices that has to meet for the success of electronics future are summarized."}{"Sources of vibration and their treatment in hydro power stations-A review ": "Vibration condition monitoring (VCM) enhances the performance of Hydro Generating Equipment (HGE) by minimizing the damage and break down chances, so that equipment stay available for a longer time. The execution of VCM and diagnosing the system of an HPS includes theoretical and experimental exploitation. Various studies have made their contribution to find out the vibration failure mechanism and incipient failures in HPS. This paper gives a review on VCM of electrical and mechanical equipment used in the HPS along with a brief explanation of vibration related faults considering past literature of around 30years. Causes of the vibrations on rotating and non-rotating equipment of HPS have been discussed along with the standards for vibration measurements. Future prospectus of VCM is also discussed."}{"Performance and emissions analysis on using acetone\u2013gasoline fuel blends in spark-ignition engine ": "In this study, new blended fuels were formed by adding 3\u201310 vol. % of acetone into a regular gasoline. According to the best of the author's knowledge, it is the first time that the influence of acetone blends has been studied in a gasoline-fueled engine. The blended fuels were tested for their energy efficiencies and pollutant emissions using SI (spark-ignition) engine with single-cylinder and 4-stroke. Experimental results showed that the AC3 (3 vol.% acetone\u2009+\u200997 vol.% gasoline) blended fuel has an advantage over the neat gasoline in exhaust gases temperature, in-cylinder pressure, brake power, torque and volumetric efficiency by about 0.8%, 2.3%, 1.3%, 0.45% and 0.9%, respectively. As the acetone content increases in the blends, as the engine performance improved where the best performance obtained in this study at the blended fuel of AC10. In particular, exhaust gases temperature, in-cylinder pressure, brake power, torque and volumetric efficiency increase by about 5%, 10.5%, 5.2%, 2.1% and 3.2%, respectively, compared to neat gasoline. In addition, the use of acetone with gasoline fuel reduces exhaust emissions averagely by about 43% for carbon monoxide, 32% for carbon dioxide and 33% for the unburnt hydrocarbons. The enhanced engine performance and pollutant emissions are attributed to the higher oxygen content, slight leaning effect, lower knock tendency and high flame speeds of acetone, compared to the neat gasoline. Finally the mechanism of acetone combustion in gasoline-fueled engines is proposed in this work; two main pathways for acetone combustion are highlighted; furthermore, the CO, CO2 and UHC (unburnt hydrocarbons) mechanisms of formation and oxidation are acknowledged. Such acetone mechanism is employed for further understanding acetone combustion in spark-ignition engines."}{"Study on the behaviour of rubber aggregates concrete beams using analytical approach ": "Concrete is one the most extensively used construction material all over the world. Many scientists and researchers are in quest for developing alternate construction material that are environment friendly and contribute towards sustainable development. Huge amount of rubber tyres waste is being generated day by day which creates the disposal problem and has many environmental issues. As this scrap rubber waste is an elastic material having less specific gravity, energy absorbent material can be used as a replacement material for obtaining lightweight concrete. In present study an attempt is made to partially replace the rubber aggregates by coarse aggregates in concrete and to study its impact on properties of concrete. A modified concrete is prepared by replacing coarse aggregates in concrete with rubber aggregates by varying the replacement proportion from 0% to 20% with increment of 5%. 3 cubes for each percentage of replacement are casted and tested after 28th days of curing. The physiomechanical properties like density, compressive strength and elastic properties of modified concrete are determined from concrete cubes experimentally and further stresses and displacement at every 50mm depth of beams are determined analytically by method of initial functions (MIF). MIF is an analytical method in which elastic properties and theoretical loads are used to analyse the beams without conducting any experimental programme. The analytical results by MIF are compared with bending theory."}{"Calibration and correction of LA-ICP-MS and LA-MC-ICP-MS analyses for element contents and isotopic ratios ": "LA-ICP-MS and LA-MC-ICP-MS have been the techniques of choice for achieving accurate and precise element content and isotopic ratio, the state-of-the-art technique combines the advantages of low detection limits with high spatial resolution, however, the analysis accuracy and precision are restricted by many factors, such as sensitivity drift, elemental/isotopic fractionation, matrix effects, interferences and the lack of sufficiently matrix-matched reference materials. Thus, rigorous and suitable calibration and correction methods are needed to obtain quantitative data. This review systematically summarized and evaluated the interference correction, quantitative calculation and sensitivity correction strategies in order to provide the analysts with suitable calibration and correction strategies according to the sample types and the analyzed elements. The functions and features of data reduction software ICPMSDataCal were also outlined, which can provide real-time and on-line data reduction of element content and isotopic ratios analyzed by LA-ICP-MS and LA-MC-ICP-MS."}{"Evaluation of lead isotope compositions of NIST NBS 981 measured by thermal ionization mass spectrometer and multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer ": "Because Pb isotopes can be used for tracing, they are widely used in many disciplines. The detection and analysis of Pb isotopes of bulk samples are usually conducted using thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) and multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS), both of which need external reference materials with known isotopic compositions to correct for the mass discrimination effect produced during analysis. NIST NBS 981 is the most widely used reference material for Pb isotope analysis; however, the isotopic compositions reported by various analytical laboratories, especially those using TIMS, vary from each other. In this study, we statistically evaluated 229 reported TIMS analysis values collected by GeoReM in the last 30 years, 176 reported MC-ICP-MS analysis values, and 938\u00a0MC-ICP-MS analysis results from our laboratory in the last five years. After careful investigation, only 40 TIMS results were found to have double or triple spikes. The ratios of the overall weighted averages, 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/204Pb, obtained from 40 spiked TIMS reports and 1114\u00a0MC-ICP-MS results of NIST NBS 981 isotopes were 16.9406\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0003 (2s), 15.4957\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0002 (2s), and 36.7184\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0007 (2s), respectively."}{"The proto-Earth geo-reactor: Reassessing the hypotheses ": "Recent high-precision isotope analysis data could be used to revisit the hypothetical past occurrence of a geo-reactor. Specific noble gas isotope signatures that could be generated by binary and ternary fissions were identified in volcano emanations or as soluble/associated species in crystalline rocks and semi-quantitatively quantified as isotopic ratio or estimated amounts. Presently if it would have been hypothetically stated that according to the actinide inventory on the Earth, local potential criticality of the geo-system, if locally concentrated, may have been reached, several questions remain such as why, where and when did any geo-reactor have been operational? Even if the hypothesis of a geo-reactor operation in the proto-Earth period would have been plausible, it is likely that a geo-reactor is not operating today. This has been recently tested by reconstructing the occurrence of actinides by antineutrino detection and tomography through the Earth.\n                  The present paper focuses on the geo-reactor hypothetical conditions including history, spatial extension and regimes. The discussion based on recent calculations involves investigations on the limits in term of fissile inventory, size and power, based on coupling of geochemical reactions and stratification through the gravitational field considering behavior through the inner mantle, the boundary with the core and the core. The reconstruction allows to formulating that from the history point of view it would have been possible that the geo-reactor reached criticality in a proto-Earth period as a reactor triggered by 235-uranium and that thorium may have worked as an absorber if the actinide concentration was locally large enough. Without actinide separation the initiation of the criticality is unlikely. However did the segregation of actinides occur in any Earth layer?"}{"Geodynamic setting of Late Cretaceous Sn\u2013W mineralization in southeastern Yunnan and northeastern Vietnam ": "The Sn\u2013W mineralization in SE Yunnan Province, China and NE Vietnam shares many similarities. Through comparing the geological and geochronological data, we suggest the Sn\u2013W deposits and the associate igneous rocks in the region represent one regional magmatic-mineralization event. To explore the geodynamic setting of these mineralization and magmatic activities, a geochronological dataset in the regions has been presented, containing data of this study and previously published. The dataset shows that the Late Cretaceous magmatic\u2013mineralization\u2013metamorphic activities widely distribute along the eastern Asian continental margin. Existing studies support that this is the product of the subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Plate beneath the Eurasian continent, which probably formed under an Andean-type active continental margin setting. According to the exhibited data, we preliminarily conclude that the late Cretaceous magmatic and Sn\u2013W mineralization activities in the southeast Yunnan and northeast Vietnam region is one part of this subduction activities and should have formed under the same geodynamic setting."}{"In-situ high spatial resolution LA-MC-ICPMS 230Th/U dating enables detection of small-scale age inversions in speleothems ": "We present an in-situ method for Th and U isotope measurements by laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICPMS) to determine possible age inversions of stalagmites, using a 213\u00a0nm Nd:YAG laser connected to an MC-ICPMS. Due to the low ion beam intensity of 230Th (20\u2013120 counts per second, cps), we carefully optimized the operating parameters to get highest possible ion beam intensities, i.e., laser fluence (25\u00a0J\u00a0cm\u22122), spot size (110\u00a0\u03bcm), pulse repetition rate (20\u00a0Hz), scan speed (4\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0s\u22121), integration time (1000\u00a0s), and He and Ar gas flow (\u223c0.9\u00a0L\u00a0min\u22121 and \u223c0.6\u00a0L\u00a0min\u22121 respectively). A precision (2 relative standard error, 2RSE) of better than 1.8% was obtained for a single 230Th/238U measurement performed on a stalagmite from H\u03cbttenbl\u04d3serschachth\u00f6hle, western Germany, having U concentrations of 2\u20137\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 and with 230Th beam intensity of less than 100\u00a0cps. Compared to previous studies (Hoffmann et\u00a0al., 2009), this is the about same precision, however at lower U concentrations. The data are corrected and calibrated by two factors (F\n                     \n                        1\n                      and F\n                     \n                        2\n                     ) for 230Th/238U and 234U/238U, respectively, using a carbonate material (flowstone in secular equilibrium). We obtained an age uncertainty (2 SE, 2\u03c3) of ca. 9\u00a0ka at ca. 215\u00a0ka. Most data agree with solution MC-ICPMS results obtained on the same sample within their uncertainties. The reproducibility of the LA-MC-ICPMS age data is within 4.5% (2RSE) as determined from 3 to 4 repeated analyses. With a spot size of 110\u00a0\u03bcm and spatial resolution of about 400\u00a0\u03bcm or higher, it is possible to see much more details in thin growing layers than conventional solution analysis, where mixed layer sampling cannot be avoided. Potential age inversions in small regions are revealed, which cannot be detected by solution analysis due to the insufficient spatial resolution."}{"Automatic design of sheet metal forming processes by \u201cun-forming\u201d ": "Most sheet metal components are made by deep drawing, which requires expensive tooling. Although many new flexible forming processes have been invented, they have largely not had industrial application, so it would be valuable if intelligent means to design new processes existed. This has not previously been attempted, although there has been work to classify both products and processes and to define optimal forming processes. A body of work in garment production examines the optimal flattening of garments, starting from their final form on a human body, to deduce the best cutting pattern from flat fabric. This paper develops a related approach for the first time, \u201cun-forming\u201d sheet metal from its finished geometry to a flat blank without prior specification of a process. An algorithm is developed that allows specification of process constraints and great freedom in implementing un-forming strategies, leading to a prediction of the strain history of the un-forming process. Reversing the direction of this history, allows prediction of the stresses in the workpiece required to form the target part, by use of an appropriate material model. The external forces (boundary conditions) required to maintain equilibrium with this stress state can then be calculated, allowing an iterative refinement of the constraints on un-forming until a physically achievable process has been designed. The approach is validated against a known process, and used to demonstrate how several previously untried forming strategies could lead to specification of new process designs. In future work, the method could be extended to allow an iterative specification of tooling to create the required boundary conditions, and hence to complete automatic process designs."}{"Characteristics and adsorption capacities of low-cost sorbents for wastewater treatment: A review ": "Low-cost by-products from agricultural, household and industrial sectors have been recognized as a sustainable solution for wastewater treatment. They allow achieving the removal of pollutants from wastewater and at same time to contribute to the waste minimization, recovery and reuse. Despite numerous reviews have been published in the last few years, a direct comparison of data obtained using different sorbents is difficult nowadays because of inconsistencies in the data presentation. In this context, the aim of the study was to revise the current literature concerning the application of low-cost adsorbents for wastewater treatment highlighting, systematically, both adsorbents characteristics and adsorption capacities. For this scope, low-cost sorbents have been divided into the following five groups: (i) Agricultural and household wastes, (ii) industrial by-products, (iii) sludge, (iv) sea materials, (v) soil and ore materials and (vi) novel low-cost adsorbents. The affinity of sorbents in removing various pollutants, their applications on real wastewater, costs and considerations on their reuse after adsorption processes, has been discussed. Finally, in order to better highlights the affinity of sorbents for more pollutants (dyes, heavy metals, biorecalcitrant compounds, nitrogen and phosphate compounds), simple methodological tools such as \u201cadsorbents-pollutants\u201d matrices have been proposed and applied. In this manner, the adsorbent candidates for replacing commercial activated carbons have been identified."}{"Experimental study of concrete made with granite and iron powders as partial replacement of sand ": "Granite Powder (GP) and Iron Powder (IP) are industrial byproducts generated from the granite polishing and milling industry in powder form respectively. These byproducts are left largely unused and are hazardous materials to human health because they are airborne and can be easily inhaled. An experimental investigation has been carried out to explore the possibility of using the granite powder and iron powder as a partial replacement of sand in concrete. Twenty cubes and ten beams of concrete with GP and twenty cubes and ten beams of concrete with IP were prepared and tested. The percentages of GP and IP added to replace sand were 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of the sand by weight. It was observed that substitution of 10% of sand by weight with granite powder in concrete was the most effective in increasing the compressive and flexural strength compared to other ratios. The test resulted showed that for 10% ratio of GP in concrete, the increase in the compressive strength was about 30% compared to normal concrete. Similar results were also observed for the flexure. It was also observed that substitution of up to 20% of sand by weight with iron powder in concrete resulted in an increase in compressive and flexural strength of the concrete."}{"Materials and membrane technologies for water and energy sustainability ": "Water and energy have always been crucial for the world's social and economic growth. Their supply and use must be sustainable. This review discusses opportunities for membrane technologies in water and energy sustainability by analyzing their potential applications and current status; providing emerging technologies and scrutinizing research and development challenges for membrane materials in this field."}{"Mapping supply chain risk by network analysis of product platforms ": "Modern technology makes use of a variety of materials to allow for its proper functioning. To explore in detail the relationships connecting materials to the products that require them, we map supply chains for five product platforms (a cadmium telluride solar cell, a germanium solar cell, a turbine blade, a lead acid battery, and a hard drive (HD) magnet) using a data ontology that specifies the supply chain actors (nodes) and linkages (e.g., material exchange and contractual relationships) among them. We then propose a set of network indicators (product complexity, producer diversity, supply chain length, and potential bottlenecks) to assess the situation for each platform in the overall supply chain networks. Among the results of interest are the following: (1) the turbine blade displays a high product complexity, defined by the material linkages to the platform; (2) the germanium solar cell is produced by only a few manufacturers globally and requires more physical transformation steps than do the other project platforms; (3) including production quantity and sourcing countries in the assessment shows that a large portion of nodes of the supply chain of the hard-drive magnet are located in potentially unreliable countries. We conclude by discussing how the network analysis of supply chains could be combined with criticality and scenario analyses of abiotic raw materials to comprise a comprehensive picture of product platform risk."}{"Life Cycle Assessment of an innovative recycling process for crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels ": "Lifecycle impacts of photovoltaic (PV) plants have been largely explored in several studies. However, the end-of-life phase has been generally excluded or neglected from these analyses, mainly because of the low amount of panels that reached the disposal yet and the lack of data about their end of life. It is expected that the disposal of PV panels will become a relevant environmental issue in the next decades. This article illustrates and analyses an innovative process for the recycling of silicon PV panel. The process is based on a sequence of physical (mechanical and thermal) treatments followed by acid leaching and electrolysis. The Life Cycle Assessment methodology has been applied to account for the environmental impacts of the process. Environmental benefits (i.e. credits) due to the potential productions of secondary raw materials have been intentionally excluded, as the focus is on the recycling process. The article provides transparent and disaggregated information on the end-of-life stage of silicon PV panel, which could be useful for other LCA practitioners for future assessment of PV technologies. The study highlights that the impacts are concentrated on the incineration of the panel\u05f3s encapsulation layers, followed by the treatments to recover silicon metal, silver, copper, aluminium. For example around 20% of the global warming potential impact is due to the incineration of the sandwich layer and 30% to the post-incineration treatments. Transport is also relevant for several impact categories, ranging from a minimum of about 10% (for the freshwater eutrophication) up to 80% (for the Abiotic Depletion Potential \u2013 minerals)."}{"From unstable CsSnI3 to air-stable Cs2SnI6: A lead-free perovskite solar cell light absorber with bandgap of 1.48eV and high absorption coefficient ": "All-inorganic and lead-free cesium tin halides (CsSnX3, X=Cl, Br, I) are highly desirable for substituting the organolead halide perovskite solar cells. However, the poor stability of CsSnX3 perovskites has so far prevented the fabrication of devices that can withstand sustained operation under normal conditions. In this paper, a two-step sequential deposition method is developed to grow high-quality B-\u03b3-CsSnI3 thin films and their unique phase change in atmosphere is explored in detail. We find the spontaneous oxidative conversion from unstable B-\u03b3-CsSnI3 to air-stable Cs2SnI6 in air. Allowing the phase conversion of the CsSnI3 film to evolve in ambient air it gives the semiconducting perovskite Cs2SnI6 with a bandgap of 1.48eV and high absorption coefficient (over 105\n                     cm\u22121 from 1.7eV). More importantly, the Cs2SnI6 film, for the first time, is adopted as a light absorber layer for a lead-free perovskite solar cell and a preliminary estimate of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) about 1% with open-circuit voltage of 0.51V and short-circuit current of 5.41mA/cm2 is realized by optimizing the perovskite absorber thickness. According to the bandgap and the Shockley-Queisser limit, such inorganic perovskite solar cell with higher efficiency and pronounced stability can be expected by material quality improvement and device engineering."}{"Stability analysis of unsaturated soil slope during rainfall infiltration using coupled liquid-gas-solid three-phase model ": "Generally, most soil slope failures are induced by rainfall infiltration, a process that involves interactions between the liquid phase, gas phase, and solid skeleton in an unsaturated soil slope. In this study, a loosely coupled liquid-gas-solid three-phase model, linking two numerical codes, TOUGH2/EOS3, which is used for water-air two-phase flow analysis, and FLAC3D, which is used for mechanical analysis, was established. The model was validated through a documented water drainage experiment over a sandy column and a comparison of the results with measured data and simulated results from other researchers. The proposed model was used to investigate the features of water-air two-phase flow and stress fields in an unsaturated soil slope during rainfall infiltration. The slope stability analysis was then performed based on the simulated water-air two-phase seepage and stress fields on a given slip surface. The results show that the safety factor for the given slip surface decreases first, then increases, and later decreases until the rainfall stops. Subsequently, a sudden rise occurs. After that, the safety factor decreases continually and reaches its lowest value, and then increases slowly to a steady value. The lowest value does not occur when the rainfall stops, indicating a delayed effect of the safety factor. The variations of the safety factor for the given slip surface are therefore caused by a combination of pore-air pressure, matric suction, normal stress, and net normal stress."}
